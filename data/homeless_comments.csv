1,186113992,Andrew Walvoord,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,3 days ago,Why not? Why should the city be putting homeless encampments in the middle of residential neighborhoods when they could have easily put them in places like the National Western grounds or the Rockies‚Äô parking lots?

10,186113992,Billie Caldwell,‚Ä¢ Hutchinson Park,3 days ago,"There is a child care facility in this church.  Would you want to walk your child through a homeless encampment? And in this particular encampment, there are no restrictions against smoking, alcohol or drug use."
11,186113992,Adelina Gonzales,‚Ä¢ West Colfax,3 days ago,Maybe if a child was exposed to what life is really like & not shielded from everything then they wouldn't grow up so privileged & hateful. If this church was actually teaching the bible then what happened to Love Thy Neighbor? It's not love thy neighbor unless they are houseless.
12,186113992,Lee Farver,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 days ago,Exactly so they shouldn‚Äôt be able to impose anything like this within an area where people do
13,186113992,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 days ago,"If you don‚Äôt like it, go start a federal/state campaign to strip all churches of their tax-exempt status. But be sure to tell everyone why you‚Äôre fired up about it."
14,186113992,Adelina Gonzales,‚Ä¢ West Colfax,3 days ago,The worst part is they also claim it's due to lack of parking for the church which pushes churchgoers into parking in front their homes. So they don't want people who attend church near their homes either? ü§£ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

21,186113992,Ossie R.,‚Ä¢ Alamo Placita,3 days ago,People want to help as long as it‚Äôs not in their backyard
22,186113992,Diane Mandile,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 days ago,Ossie R. Reading through this thread I'm not sure I'd even agree that people want to help. Some are so disgusted by these human beings that they don't seem to care what happens to them as long as they don't have to deal with it in their neighborhood.
23,186113992,John S.,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,3 days ago,I understand the point of those advocating for compassion...but this isn‚Äôt the right manifestation of it. The people who live in the neighborhood and send their kids to school there should also have there rights a safe environment respected.

25,186113992,Diane Mandile,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 days ago,"John S. The neighborhood, and the surrounding neighborhods, already have homeless people living in them. This will be an improvement over people living in alleys. This is a controlled living situation. Please explain the danger to the neighbors"
26,186113992,Larry M.,‚Ä¢ Highland,3 days ago,I don't understand where these homeless people were living before now.  There has been a moratorium pretty much nationwide against evictions and foreclosures.  Which implies that nobody has been recently displaced in the last year.    
27,186113992,Nate T.,‚Ä¢ Highland,3 days ago,"The key word here is implies.  But it‚Äôs not the truth, plenty of people have been kicked out of their apartments in the last year. They can‚Äôt afford legal fees to fight for their apartment."

30,186113992,Holley Kaufman,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,3 days ago,I wish the US had more mental health help. I mean where are all these people supposed to go that need help? Also why doesn‚Äôt the city find a place to build miniature houses to get some of them back on their feet or the counseling they need?
31,186113992,anna gross,‚Ä¢ Eastmoor Park,3 days ago,It's actually cheaper to do what you are recamending instead of keeping them homeless you can look it up !
32,186113992,anna gross,‚Ä¢ Eastmoor Park,3 days ago,"Fast fact to leave the average homeless person on the street cost roughly $40,000 per person. To house them and provide mental and physical support costs roughy $15,000 a year. I learned this at a rally at the Capitol a few years ago.( The dollar amount may be a little off but very close to what I stated)  It's actually saves tax payers money to house the homeless and give them skills and the ability to be clean and get hired than it does to leave them on the streets.a very good friend of mine runs one of these sights. many of the homeless that take advantage of these camps are our vets and our disabled homeless and our mentality ill. The ones that need it!  The people that cause the crimes are the druggies not the bulk of the homeless population. And the drug users usually don't even have it together enough to get into places like this. These people are actually to improve their lives. If people would actually take some time to get to know the people in the camps before insisting these people are going to hurt there kids( which is a bit of an over reach ) they would come to see the difference. There are alot of criminals on the streets but they are different that alot of the homeless population. I'm not saying criminals cannot be homeless because of course they can be however the people at these camps just want some help and supervision at least at the camp my friend supervises that's what I have seen first hand. Majority or the population is older or mentality ill or disabled and trying to get some help . The criminals are running the streets while these people sleep quietly in there tents !"
33,186113992,Terry H.,‚Ä¢ Golden Triangle,3d,"Anna - while I agree that those that want help should be able to get it, there are many options already that exist in Denver. See https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Departments/Department-of-Housing-Stability/Resident-Resources.  Where I live, we have a different problem.  Most of the people in the street tents are mostly young men (and some women) who are hard core drug addicts who do heroin and meth all day.  I have never seen a single child in any of these tents in our neighborhood, and I see them in the alley right outside my bedroom window every day.  I also met with the Denver Police this week, and the police confirmed they are ""service resistant"" people meaning that they are offered mental health, drug treatment, and housing support every day and they refuse.  They instead want the ""freedom"" to live in a tent, do drugs, and not have to change.  People (many from churches) bring them food to eat every day.  I saw a van full of nuns do this last week.  The drug tents remain in neighborhoods who are terrorized by these people every day with open drug use, public deification, completely blocked sidewalks, urination, stolen bicycles, car theft, prostitution, yelling in the middle of the night, etc..  I have been the victim of this crime with 7 of these illegal drug tent ""communities"" within 1 block of me for over the last year.  Trust me, you do not want to have to live with this!  Last year someone was stabbed right on my block next to a child care center in daylight hours.  This is real and not made up.  While the Denver Health Department does ""clean up"" or sweep these illegal drug tents, it can take months for them to do so.  However, the people just move down the street and set up their tents again, and stay in the new location for months, causing havoc at the new location.  While there is an urban camping ban, the police and Denver Heath Department have many restrictions now (at least 1 week notice, search warrant to even open a tent, public heath impact assessments, etc.)  The police told us that there is an 8 page ""protocol"" document they must follow to deal with with an encampment.  Most of this is due to a lawsuit that the ""pro-tent"" people won in court.  Also, Denver has made heroin and meth use a misdemeanor, so the police don't even bother arresting people for this anymore.  The word is out in the ""drug culture"" community that Denver is a great place to settle  in a tent.  People feed you all day, you get cheap and easy assess to your drugs, and the police will do nothing to stop you!  You might have to move your tent every few months, but the weather is great, except in the winter!  The only way to stop a drug tent community is to put up fencing (or big rocks, or other defensive architecture) to make it impossible for these folks to pitch a tent on your street or on your property.(edited)"

35,186113992,Damon Thomas,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,3 days ago,Maybe ask the indigenous Americans how well reservations have worked for them.   Funding substance abuse  and mental health treatment would help the majority of urban houseless far more than sending them to sanctioned reservations where substance abuse festers and the schizophrenic languish.

62,185885904,Sam Speight,‚Ä¢ North Side,2 days ago,"Leave it to the Jesuits to lead on the most destructive path possible. Whomever is in charge up there is following his jesuit oath faithfully. We create a really great neighborhood and the Jesuits on behalf of their Bolshevik ideologies are here to fuck it up under the virtue-signaling idiotic principles of wokeism. I predict a sharp rise in crime, a drop in small business ownership, a general mood of a dark cloud to settle in, a massive increase in drug trafficking as well as paraphernalia litter everywhere, except property value to make a significant drop, general violence to rise, squatters to start taking root and eventually this will be how you sell your homes for a fraction of what you bought it for. Regis will bring as many miscreants as possible to our back yards but I'll bet my right eye nothing beyond an attraction for drugs and crime is provided in this safe space. The homeless will move in and grow until it becomes an autonomous zone just like Portland. Welcome to the neighborhood people. The politics running at federal, state, local, and academics levels are in full force to achieving their goals to ruin everything good you've worked to obtain.  Don't believe me? Just wait. You will. Put a stop to this now or live with the memory that I told you so."

While the article poses good news in the few months since it opened, it'll be interesting to see if these camps have a lasting effect on the people who were helped by it. I certainly hope so. That being said, it still sucks that this new camp in question was set up without communication to park hill neighbors beforehand. Its an awful way to go about it."

We as Park Hill residents are fortunate and fear shouldn't be the basis of our judgements. It is not intended to be a free-for-all ""encampment.""

84,183301151,Rachel Canning,‚Ä¢ City Park,13 Apr,"Hey, I know we all have different opinions on what leads to homelessness due to our own unique backgrounds, but I think it's best not to vilify an entire population of people. I understand they make you uncomfortable, but the reality is, our unhoused neighbors deserve compassion and respect just like our housed neighbors do. If you can't get on board with the camp, fine. At least let them have some peace, and don't make their lives even harder than they currently are. Just direct your focus elsewhere and let them be. And if you really don't want them there, you might like to consider how you could help them rather than fear mongering about their presence. Helping them feel empowered and safe is the best way to lessen the impact of our unhoused friends on neighborhoods. Everyone deserves safety, security, and respect, regardless of their housing status, their ability levels, whether or not they suffer from addiction, etc. There's really no room to argue on this."
85,183301151,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,20 Apr,"Thank you! I mean...look I get for the people of South Park Hill this really IS in their backyard. And they would've preferred a voice in the process (which I kind of read as the right to say no to it, which the church didn't ask for, the church just decided to do it. That's the church's own legal right as far as I can tell). But umm...it's happening. It's happening for 6 months, at a time when the people who will be in the Safe Outdoor Space really need it. It'd be nice to see the neighborhood come to grips with that and make the best of it instead of having a freakout over it. Just my two cents. Hope to see some of you all there volunteering at the site at some point."
86,183301151,Lynn Hartfield,‚Ä¢ City Park,13 Apr,"How about we both admit each side has a point? No one, no matter how sympathetic and well-intentioned, wants human beings living in tents on their front lawns, and that sentiment is magnified when the encampments come with drugs, trash, human waste, etc. The Safe Outdoor Spaces are trying to address an entrenched problem by providing spaces that can be maintained and providing services to the people living there. They will probably be very helpful to higher functioning people who have lost their housing due to financial problems, but they will likely not address the many people who are on the street due to mental health and drug problems (which often go together). Take a deep breath, all. This is a citywide problem, and  Cap Hill, RiNo and Curtis Park shouldn't have to bear it alone."
87,183301151,Jeff Peshut,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Apr,Does this so-called sanctioned encampment comply with Denver's zoning ordinance?  Do we know how many of the 50 people have previously owned or rented homes in Denver?  Will be there only temporarily as a result of temporary economic circumstances?  Suffer from some form of primary addiction?  Some form of chronic mental health condition? Some form of chronic physical health condition?  Have criminal records?  Have recently moved to Denver?  Were experiencing homelessness when they moved here?  Lots to know and understand.

I also worked for the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless for little pay.  I know my clients did not deserve what happened to nearly all of them.  Drugs was an escape for the hopeless; many were very good, kind and caring people.  So, to remedy the trash, put more trash barrels out or recycle bins.  Let the camps be vested in the environment they live.  Right on to the Churches and donations that have gone above and beyond their abilities. Not all homeless are bad but like police, it only takes one or two bad guys to ruin a reputation.  Where can you send homeless people, anyway?  Any place can be bad or good.  Thanks to South Park Hill for getting out of the comfort zone and stepping up to help humanity.  Now, helping young teens becoming independent may reduce future houseless people, but there are no jobs when young ones are competing for the jobs older people need, and VOCATIONS are minimal or non-existent.  Simultaneously, we must work on current homeless and prevent further - and our country does a great job of segregating the poor from the wealthy.  I Love Park Hill because poor, hard working people and the wealthy people care, not just the old growth and old brick homes, but the diversity of my community.  I have lived here my whole life.  ...And, the new transplants join our thinking.  Thanks to you, too.  Thanks, Kozlowicz, NO fear-mongering."
90,183301151,Ana Gonzo,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,13 Apr,"RoSean Howard People are not fear-mongering as much as they are legitimately scared of the element of change a SOS can bring to their doorstep. The way to remedy, or at least lessen and sway people, is to inform not point fingers and all caps NIMBY at them. The website Tim Townsend posted is helpful and may sway some who are on the fence. Park Hill UM did the SOS a tremendous disservice by not getting ahead of the information. Try to remember, all of a sudden word got out a ""homeless encampment"" is being located in the middle of Park Hill. Neighbors are envisioning the encampments in and around Cap Hill that had rat infestation, super spreader events, criminal activity, etc. Being kind to everyone also encompasses those who are scared of how this will impact their neighborhood and lives, not just the homeless."
91,183301151,Cynthia Pesantez,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,13 Apr,"There but for the grace of God go I. Any one of us could be homeless in a city with astronomical housing prices and few safety nets. How many people lost jobs in the pandemic? How many lost housing due to banks and landlords‚Äô inflexibility once the pandemic hit? It could have been me. It could have been you. We have a responsibility to help our neighbors. My goodness we are so fortunate. I think every day how lucky I am to be fed, clothed, housed, with relative financial security. Don‚Äôt you? Don‚Äôt you ever look around your space and go, ‚Äúholy moly, am I lucky!‚Äù So many of our neighbors don‚Äôt have that. It‚Äôs not our place to judge each one asking why and how they are now unhoused. Instead, let‚Äôs help! Let‚Äôs volunteer at that church if they need it. Let‚Äôs offer odd jobs to those who want them. Let‚Äôs give of our abundance, share so more can have a little. Let us meet our unhoused neighbors with love and compassion, not fear and contempt. We are, all of us, human, and have erred in different ways. Some big some small. Some with the good fortune to bounce back, and some not. But we all deserve grace, and patience, and agency, and help. Don‚Äôt give in to fear. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of thinking you are so different from your unhoused neighbors. There but by the grace of God go we all."

98,183301151,Kelley Dawkins,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,13 Apr,It's wonderful to see a church helping to provide shelter and services to the homeless in a city where housing prices are astronomically high. It seems to me like they are living their Christian values.
99,183301151,Sara Lange,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Apr,"It seems to me they should shift their focus to reopening their church and school to in-person visits.  That is what people in the neighborhood understood they were moving near.  They understood the traffic, the schedules, the clientele that might frequent those places.  If UMC doesn't feel it's safe enough to open for school or worship, how can they safely take on the task of providing responsible housing?!"
100,183301151,Debby Schwartz,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,13 Apr,How about putting the camps in the Governors and Mayors backyards?????????
101,183301151,Drew Lavin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Apr,It will be a block from Senator Hickenlooper's house.
102,183301151,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Apr,"The backyard argument doesn't include the support services also necessary to pull someone out of homelessness. Perhaps talking with someone in that situation, understanding the trauma of living in a very unstable situation, and all that it takes to recover from it would help understanding. It's truly not a black-and-white situation. Some folks just don't ask for help until it's too late."
103,183301151,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,13 Apr,Please volunteer at the existing site before you make any judgements. They could use more volunteers. 
104,183301151,Robin Wells,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,14 Apr,That waiver is pretty intenseüò≥ Why aren‚Äôt residents responsible for most of the tasks? It would be a start in learning responsibility I would think.
105,183301151,Debby Schwartz,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,4w,I didn‚Äôt know we paid taxes to have homeless camps move in next door??? Be that as it May! What is the Governor and Mayor doing about this situation! Some of these people want to stay in tents and the ones that need help to transition out of the camps into housing should be taken care of so they can move on! The Governor and Mayor are ignoring this and just moving people are the city like Chess pieces !‚ôü‚ôü‚ôü(edited)

108,183906949,Olga Guerra,‚Ä¢ Hale,18 Apr,Lovely and comprehensive explanation and description. Thank you. What a wonderful faith in action community PHUMC is!!
109,183906949,Jeanne Price,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,18 Apr,"Jim, does PHUMC need donations of any sort? Cash, food, Cleanup crews? If so, please post a list."
110,183906949,Scott Hughes,‚Ä¢ Hale,18 Apr,From what I read the proposed site will close December 31 and I didn't see anything about any commitment to relocate the inhabitants to at least equal accommodations. So there is the included mass forced eviction of the space on New Years Eve which would be violation of Article 25 of the UDHR. Another thing I think would be helpful is some structured organized activities available for the inhabitants like occupational therapy
111,183906949,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Apr,Scott have you read how the SOS/CVC works?
112,183906949,Sue Bruner,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Apr,Thank you Jim.
113,183906949,Michael Annison,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,19 Apr,Well said - good for you
114,183906949,Joe Haynes,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Apr,I'm glad to hear your sane and humane voice on this.
115,183906949,Dani Tyler,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,19 Apr,It's not a 'near-by' children's center. The parking lot is where employees and parents park to drop off kids. The kitchen the kids eat in opens up to the parking lot as well as the gym they play in. I'm sure SOS camps are normally great and I fully support having one in the neighborhood but not at PHUMC.  Find a church that isn't also a preschool or look into one of the many unused parking lots a few blocks north just south of the highway.
116,183906949,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Apr,150 churches were offered this opportunity.
117,183906949,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,19 Apr,Proud of Park Hill and of posts like this! People: be sure to turn up for the meeting tonight and the May 1st one to spread the positivity!
118,183906949,Kevin and Catherine Cray,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Apr,"Having watched the neighborhood meetings for the Denver Community Church location and visiting with the manager of the Baptist Church location, I am convinced of the value to the residents and of the professional supervision of the sites. I am hoping that we will show hospitality to these new residents in Park Hill during their stay here. What a good opportunity to share some of the peace that Jim speaks of that we cherish in Park Hill. Gabe, please tell us more about how to join the meetings tonight and May 1st."
119,183906949,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,19 Apr,That's lovely to hear! Here are the details: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc0c64290f904038485248a/t/6074c2cd84c8b74537496b79/1618264781795/PH_CommConvo-Apr_web.pdf

125,183906949,Towanna Henderson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,19 Apr,Thank you! I will volunteer if needed.
126,183906949,Susan Lane,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Apr,"Thank you, Jim, for a very good explanation and perspective."
127,183906949,Sharon Kermiet,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Apr,I support PHUMC in this effort.  What they are doing is profound in the face of so much need.
128,183906949,Mary Groves,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,20 Apr,"My takeaway from the PHUMC presentation is this is an already established community living at the First Baptist Church downtown. It sounds like this community has already been screened and the antisocial contingent  have been screened out to a certain degree. Does that assure there won't be problems? No and there will be other homeless trying to join and some problems will occur. Does PHUMC deserve a chance to explore this community project? That's what we're exploring. Could the presentation have been more organized? Yes ,but that will come with experience. That is not what we are discussing ."
129,183906949,Rich McClintock,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3w,Thanks to PH United Methodist and Temple Micah for comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable. Do I hear some squirming? ü§î(edited)

132,182941686,Dave Vincent,‚Ä¢ Hale,9 Apr,That church is doing exactly what they should be doing. You should be ashamed of yourself.
133,182941686,Debbie Elliott,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Apr,What church? National Jewish is a hospital and this borders their construction lot.
134,182941686,Lynn Ferguson,‚Ä¢ Hale,9 Apr,"Wow, lady."
135,182941686,Stephanie Rose,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,9 Apr,"Thanks for the heads up, I‚Äôll  bring them some sandwiches and keep an eye out on the playground to pick up IF there is trash."
136,182941686,Jovita Harings,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,4w,I don‚Äôt know exactly how I‚Äôd react if this was on my corner. I‚Äôm pretty sure nit well but this is probably the most decent comment I‚Äôve seen for both sides involved in a long time. üôåüèΩ(edited)
137,182941686,Evelyn Bordeaux,‚Ä¢ Hale,9 Apr,"Is anyone else OUTRAGED that our city and community doesn‚Äôt do more to care for our houseless neighbors!? If you want to see less houseless camps, donate money, volunteer for organizations like Denver Homelessness Outloud, and vote for elected officials that are actually working for an equitable society/community."
138,182941686,Florine Nath,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,9 Apr,Its not about lack of money. The City of Denver has $50 million each year in the budget to address homelessness. The question is are they deploying it effectively - seems not.
139,182941686,Mark Cozart,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Apr,I drive by this on my way to work at 230 am. The people there are out and about in the neighborhood at that time. I chased one out of a car last week. This morning someone was carrying a large box of stuff down the block. I see them urinating often. 
140,182941686,Valerie Pulsipher,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Apr,Well said. Thank you.
141,182941686,Susan Tattershall,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,9 Apr,Where are these unhoused people suppose to go?
142,182941686,Mark Cozart,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Apr,"How about shelters or the coliseum parking lot or another sanctioned camp? Somewhere that is set up to help. I worked building apartments where I had to step over people on the sidewalk passed out. The police said not to try and wake them. I also walked between jobs through an alley that ran between restaurants so filled with human feces I almost vomited. Watched people shoot up there in the open. So there is a real problem no doubt but the solution should not involve making our neighborhoods unsafe for children or adults to walk down the sidewalk. Or to contaminate the parking strips, streets or yards with human waste or drug paraphernalia. I am sympathetic to the plight of the homeless but also know that not all are mentally ill or just down on their luck. Let‚Äôs find a real solution not force our neighbors to host campers"
143,182941686,Jim Miller,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Apr,Kansas
144,182941686,Stephanie Rose,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,9 Apr,"Basically what Giuliani did for New York shipped them to Jersey. Not funny but I mean, kinda funny."
145,182941686,Rob Brown,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,9 Apr,"OK, you‚Äôre outraged. So, where do you suggest they SQUAT? You have a First World issue that you‚Äôre applying to third world people."
146,182941686,Stephanie Rose,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,9 Apr,Y‚Äôall are quick to bring lost dogs home with you but to help a human being oh gosh no ... listen I‚Äôm not perfect either but just consider it for a moment.
147,182941686,Rachael Chitty,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,10 Apr,I have helped many homeless and have been screwed over every time.
148,182941686,Charlene/Joseph Medina,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,11 Apr,Rachael Chitty üò¢Thank You for trying. Sadly each human has a long story for why they are homeless; yet we can try to do something.
149,182941686,Chris Nickerson,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,9 Apr,"Thanks for the numbers Beth Daoud . Try not to let the virtue signaling from mayfair and cherry creekers change how you feel about your own neighborhood. We have called a few times and will continue to call and do what we think is right for our space.... If someone is bashing on you for having your own feelings and protecting your neighborhood, maybe we can help. They can post their address and I will pay for the cab ride to move the people in question to a""less hostile"" area. Bam..everyone wins."
150,182941686,Valerie Pulsipher,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Apr,Agree
151,182941686,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,9 Apr,NIMBY much?
152,182941686,Widicker Ava,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Apr,When we discharge a homeless person from the ED.  Resources of several pages are given to them.  Sometimes it goes out the door with them.  Often it is thrown in the garbage.
153,182941686,Amy Pieper,‚Ä¢ Hale,10 Apr,"What is a houselessness person supposed to do with those papers? Get in the car, drive home and get on the computer?"
154,182941686,Widicker Ava,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Apr,They have phones.  We are always charging them.  iPhone chargers we have bought for charging them at work.  It is rare they do not have a phone.  They have told me they‚Äôd rather be on the street.
155,182941686,Ana Gonzo,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,10 Apr,"Stephanie R. I work at a hospital, specifically the ER. We not only discharge with pamphlets, throw them at the homeless and send them on their way. We offer a plethora of counseling and additional resources. How dare you suggest otherwise. I am not a young woman, I have been doing this for decades. I know the value of keeping beer in the employee frig at the hospital for homeless alcoholics. When I drive past some of these encampments I know what is going on and I know the kinds of people who frequent them. The people in the encampments who want help and want to change know how to seek the resources. A lot of them are better versed in the law and social services available than most police officers. ‚ÄúWell then that‚Äôs a mental health issue‚Äù seriously we know this. When I sign discharge papers and than someone takes a literal poo on them and leaves it in the center of a room? Sane? Maybe. But that‚Äôs what‚Äôs out there. YOU‚ÄôRE not going to fix it, I AM not going to fix it, the OP isn‚Äôt going to. Certainly getting on a high horse on Nextdoor mocking neighbors for their concerns CERTAINLY won‚Äôt fix it. When Reagan shut down the mental services in this country, the problem started rolling downhill. We need group efforts at the very highest levels. We don‚Äôt need to be worrying about the All Star game and how great Polis and Hancock will look. Further, putting these encampments in the middle of neighborhoods is not a good idea. The criminal element which almost always follows these encampments is not worth the risk to neighbors and children. (Just so people know, a lot of sexual predators stay in encampments because housing is difficult for them to obtain...more broken systems) So, this is an extremely complex problem. This NIMBY stuff being thrown around like it‚Äôs meant to embarrass people for their concern is, in a word, stupid. You want to help? Go into the encampments and clean. Get trained in narcan protocols. Clean up used needles (although the homeless tend to pick those up and resell them in exchange for drugs) with a biohazard box. Dispense condoms. Dispense sanitizer. Dispense common meds like neosporin and hydrogen peroxide. It‚Äôs not the sexy stuff like socks and food but the encampments get plenty of socks and food. The unsexy stuff like condoms and basic meds is much more useful. "
156,182941686,Widicker Ava,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,4w,iPhones are the most common.  And Samsung.   Offices are open(edited)
157,182941686,Louma Levin,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,10 Apr,If you have an idea/project that you think could help people who are struggling with housing who are the best people to contact?
158,182941686,Stephanie Rose,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,4w,There‚Äôs several.  The sidewalk project in LA they are doing great work and have shown interest in a Denver chapter.  Also some churches (not all which is crazy) have programs for volunteers.  I bet there‚Äôs also an app for volunteers you could download.  Or neighbors like me - would love to hear your idea.  I‚Äôm a figure it out make it happen person.(edited)
159,182941686,Leslie Hoff,‚Ä¢ City Park,10 Apr,I hope these camps never include one of your children.
160,182941686,Judy Werner,‚Ä¢ Hale,10 Apr,"That is the easy part, being a NIMBY.  How about complaining to your City Council rep that there isn't enough low income housing. (Not that it would do any good).  Or better yet, call REDPEAK  AND ask them to designate 5% of their apartments for low income housing."
161,182941686,Ana Gonzo,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,10 Apr,Judy Werner the easy part is getting on a neighborhood app and throwing an acronym around at your neighbors and completely dismissing their concerns. Calling Redpeak and requesting 5% go to affordable housing is naive. How about our kind and generous governor and mayor reach out to Redpeak and offer tax incentives for converting a percentage of housing into affordable apartments? How about we discuss our elected officials who make campaign promises and not hold up their end of the entrusted vote? Turning on your neighbor because he or she is scared is not a solution.
162,182941686,Lily Elizabeth Feldman,‚Ä¢ Lowry,10 Apr,"So, your solution to your ‚Äúoutrage‚Äù is to attempt to force your unhoused neighbors to be relocated to... a different neighbor‚Äôs backyard?? How is calling NJH security anything other than harassment of people who are experiencing homelessness and need a place to sleep??"
163,182941686,Barb Riley,‚Ä¢ Lowry,10 Apr,"Because there are plenty of shelters for those who simply need a place to sleep. But what about the chronically homeless? The ones who do not follow the rules of the shelters? Addicts will do anything to support their addiction. I don't believe the average citizen has the skill set to personally handle this. I support the groups that provide housing, Healthcare, etc. as they are trained. We bring sleeping bags that get traded for alcohol or drugs...the problem runs deeper than a sleeping bag will solve."
164,182941686,Lane O‚ÄôConnor,‚Ä¢ Hale,10 Apr,"You can‚Äôt talk about the unhoused community in absolutes. ‚ÄúThey have phones.‚Äù ‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs a mental health issue,‚Äù referring to why people are living on the streets. And sure there‚Äôs a criminal element to homelessness sometimes, but I‚Äôd argue that it‚Äôs more complex than people choosing to commit crimes. And sure, some are addicts, but some are not. "
165,182941686,Ana Gonzo,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,10 Apr,Lane O‚ÄôConnor you say you‚Äôre not here to criticize anyone but you criticized the OP and you‚Äôre criticizing those who don‚Äôt have the same view as you.
166,184828873,Jane Skarka,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,26 Apr,Sounds like someone is probably poisoning in your neighborhood.
167,184828873,Darja Pisorn,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,26 Apr,"Is it possible for squirrels to wake up after being poisoned? I still wonder how that ""dead"" squirrel disappeared the first time."
168,184828873,Celine Garrett,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Apr,All I can say as someone that has observed squirrels üêø most of my life. 
169,184828873,Jane Skarka,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,26 Apr,That is strange. I don‚Äôt know. Especially because you covered him. Very odd. I still suspect foul play.
170,184828873,Mark Ryan,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Apr,You have the hardest partying squirrels I‚Äôve ever heard of....
171,184828873,David Mendel,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,27 Apr,We occasionally find them dead under our tree with no other signs of injury. I always just figured they fell.
172,184828873,Stacy Block,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Apr,Probably poison üò•
173,184828873,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Apr,We found a squirrel dead under one of our huge trees. Because we have 3 other residents I thought it fell out of the tree. Then last week I was walking our dog and saw a very stunned fellow laying in the sidewalk. On my way home he was gone.  I never thought much about this until your post.
174,184828873,Darja Pisorn,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,27 Apr,"I first thought it died because it fell out of the tree, but after some googling read that it's actually pretty rare for that to happen. Sounds like poisoning, our mailman said he saw two other dead squirrels on his route just yesterday. I wish the city would test them, to make sure it's not a disease, but the lady I spoke w from the city just said ""they don't do that."""
175,184828873,Ryan Haley,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,27 Apr,It sounds like they're being poisoned
176,184828873,H Paul Cohen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,27 Apr,"Were they wearing masks? It could be Covid. If you notice very few squirrels are social distancing, at least not properly. Ref cdc report 459-cw"
177,184828873,Darja Pisorn,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,27 Apr,OMG you're right. Not a single mask!!! And they are definitely not distancing. Where do I go to file a complaint?
178,184828873,Mariette Bell,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,27 Apr,"I had a similar experience with a squirrel appearing to have fallen from the tree on to my driveway. It was twitching every so slightly, but half an hour later not at all. I, too, too a shovel and put the squirrel under a tree. Later in the day, it was gone. Have no idea if an animal got it or it was somehow revived. Very strange."
179,184828873,Celine Garrett,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Apr,"They are lazy bums this time of year and fall out of their nests, likely kicked by offspring."

181,184828873,Jean T.,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,28 Apr,"Or a bird of prey, they're fast to find things like this!"
182,184828873,Tom Turner,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,27 Apr,Squirrels are most often not injured if thay fall.
183,184828873,Nicole Delmoro,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Apr,We had a crow get into a fight with a squirrel in our tree and knocked her and her kids out of the tree and they did not survive.  Maybe a territory fight is causing them to fall?
184,184828873,Jean T.,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,28 Apr,"Excellent point, the only time I've seen them fall was when being attacked by hawks."
185,184828873,Priyanka Mathur,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,30 Apr,We had a similar situation in our tree last fall. I saw a couple crows and squirrels fighting. Came back 10 minutes later to find a dead crow under the tree. It must have fallen and hit a concrete block in our garden. The crows and squirrels do not get along.
186,184828873,Karin Schumacher,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Apr,"Call Kevin Fitzgerald , Vet at Alameda Animal Hospital- (from Animal Planet!) - he should know.  Or Denver Public Health Dept.: if poisoning is going on, it could be very dangerous for our dogs, cats, children playing in yards, etc. and hopefully the perpetrator(s) could be traced.   Seems like far too many ""accidents"" for it to be normal squirrel behavior."
187,184828873,Jean T.,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,1w,"Agreed, if birds of prey/coyotes/fox are picking up the dead squirrels the cycle of poisoning continues. Please spread the word the poisoning is not a good idea."
188,184828873,Nicole Gayton,‚Ä¢ Skyland,28 Apr,Someone on here posted about similar occurrences near a park (can‚Äôt remember which) a while back. The verdict at that time was poisoning and people suggested keeping house pets clear and to keep them from drinking water on walks in the area since that could be contaminated. The zombie squirrel vibe might be because they were slowly dying from it. Sad news for the little chonkers.
189,184828873,Gabriel Kaplan,‚Ä¢ City Park,28 Apr,Haven‚Äôt they found plague in some of the city park squirrels?  Could that be it?
190,184828873,Victoria Howell,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,28 Apr,He was probably playing dead squirrel will do that but they are probably fighting over territory squirrels usually have 2 nests one for the family and one for themselves like a man cave or a she shed lol I to have woken up to a dead one before in the front lawn very confusing but it's possible they could be getting poisoned and then just dropping out the tree or they have a squirrel war going on over territory which often happens in neighborhood due to abundance of food

192,184828873,David Day,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,28 Apr,That tree is prime real estate. My guess is that the squirrels are fighting for it. I watched two squirrels go at it and one fell about 30 feet to the ground from a tree in my backyard last week so maybe this is what is happening?

195,183611885,Beth Celva,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Apr,I‚Äôm glad you and your neighbor weren‚Äôt injured. There was a cedar hedge set on fire next to the front porch of a home last week. 
196,183611885,Robin Wells,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,15 Apr,Even if you can put one out safely call 911!
197,183611885,Sandra Moore,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Apr,Is this a homeless thing?
198,183611885,Robin Wells,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,15 Apr,"Until the authorities know who is doing it I would avoid assuming that. My brain went there, but no one knows yet. Could be anyone ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
199,183611885,Karin Schumacher,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Apr,Is someone trying is to keep warm with a fire- and just ignorant of what might happen??
200,183611885,Crystal Weaver,‚Ä¢ City Park,15 Apr,"No I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a utilitarian thing. They would‚Äôve picked a different spot. Plus the firemen said it‚Äôs happening all over town, dumpster fires, shrubs, etc. who knows their motives."
201,183611885,Beth Celva,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,16 Apr,"It seems to be arson based on the report on the news, the comment of the fireman to the homeowner and the homeowners."
202,183611885,Alan Moores,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,16 Apr,Thanks for putting it out! Good work! You might have saved that tree.
203,183611885,Catherine Fern,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,16 Apr,That kind of thing looks like someone who is obsessed with watching fires per se
204,183611885,Carl Smith,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,16 Apr,The fire dept showed up in our back alleyway yesterday. I realized later when pulling out of our garage that our neighbor‚Äôs garage had burn marks on it and it looked like a small fire started and was put out quickly.
205,183611885,Vibeke Senn,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,16 Apr,"This is disturbing, will be on the lookout!"
206,183611885,Ali Larson,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,16 Apr,"There was a fire in our alley two nights ago as well, Fire Dept thought it might have been a cigarette butt hitting a patch of dry weeds/sticks/grass next to a garage... but had they not come soon enough, our garage and our neighbor's garage would have been destroyed. I'm concerned."
207,183611885,Ali Larson,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,16 Apr,Here's a photo right before the fire truck came
208,183611885,Tarasa H.,‚Ä¢ North Capitol Hill,16 Apr,So there was a guy who was doing this last summer. My guess he is out.
209,183611885,Ginger Adair,‚Ä¢ RiNo Art District,16 Apr,Oops.
210,183611885,Philip Rutherford,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,16 Apr,There may be an unlicensed old white van that these guys are driving around in.  The same thing happened to my daughter and her family in the Central Park neighborhood and the van was spotted by my granddaughter. He burned down their back fence. There is a video of him from the waist down showing him lighting the fire at 02:30 A:M

228,185372613,Kammy Alford,‚Ä¢ City Park West,1 May,"Shameful on so many levels.  Next time someone may not be so lucky and will be burned badly or die a horrible death.  Did anyone see the story about the tiny homes they built on an oddly shaped piece of land in North Hollywood I believe.  Why can't Denver do something like this?  Obviously what ""we"" are doing isn't working.  Am I dreaming or didn't a majority vote pass for funding for the homeless?  Where is that money and the ideas and plans to utilize the money?  I don't get it.  Can someone on the city counsel or the Mayor's office explain it to me and others?  Please?  Kammy"
229,185372613,Doug Bohm,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,1 May,There is a tiny home village established in Globeville. It took nearly 4 years to get the 24 tiny homes set up. 
230,185372613,Kit Leventhal,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,1 May,Gawd...I don‚Äôt like homeless people trashing neighborhoods(personal experience)but burning down anyone‚Äôs property is just wrong.
231,185372613,Vibeke Senn,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,2 May,"I believe we have a Pryro , several fires have been set in the general vicinity of colfax ( all along the corridor. Within 2-3 blocks , in cap hill and city park west as well . I do not believe this was a single incident. But that the fire department did not put it out is kind of disturbing ."
232,185372613,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,1w,"From the way you wrote your post, sounds like the neighbor who stabbed the tent was the one who started the fire. Why would this man purposely burn his only belongings? Let‚Äôs not assume here the homeless man started the fire.(edited)"
233,185372613,Iheanyi Umez-Eronini,‚Ä¢ Skyland,2 May,Sadie Martin neighbor describes someone who has a home.
234,185372613,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,2 May,"I agree with Iheanyi, the OP was saying that the homeless person who lived in the tent was not there, that there is a housed neighbor who has been attacking their tent."
235,185372613,Jami Swegarden,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,2 May,I live in the building adjacent and was present for much of this. 
236,185372613,Megan Bee,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,2 May,"Hello everyone.  I have a friend who has been very involved in getting the homeless issue back on the ballot - the ""group living"" allowance which is the loophole to what we are seeing in Denver, namely massive encampments alongside properties.  The organization behind this ballot push is called safeandsounddenver.org and they have had citywide locations set up the last few weekends to acquire signatures.  It's probably worth looking into this as the problem is not being solved and the impact on neighborhoods is extreme, as you have just witnessed.  There was one adjacent to my work for 8 weeks.  That's how long it takes to basically move them along.  In the meantime, drug dealers provide a tent, propane and essentials to the head honcho of the encampment, who then aids in the distribution of the drugs.  As such, the people in these types of encampments - not families trying to get a break, as the proponents would have you believe - have no interest in shelters where they can't do drugs.  Once the city finally cracks down on them, after two months of waste, debris, garbage, drug paraphernalia, feces, etc. have accumulated next to properties trying to conduct business or reside while paying property taxes, they simply move to a new place to settle and await the eight week turnaround.  It's a disaster.  It's a multi-layered issue, I realize, but getting this back on the ballot is an important step."
237,185372613,Jackie Dash,‚Ä¢ Whittier,2 May,Just FYI that link doesn‚Äôt seem to be correct
238,185372613,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,2 May,Do you know what happened to the person who lost all their belongings and has been the target of the violent person? Is there any kind of collection going on to get them some much needed survival gear?
239,185372613,Tess Garman,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,1w,"Hey I live in the building where this happened. The tent-guy involved lost a lot of what he owned. :[  A bunch of his money, as well as all his clothing, tent, etc. us neighbors pooled together what cash we had and provided some clothing, jackets, blankets, phone, water, cereal, fruit snacks. I offered him my tent but he declined because he said he has a tent he can probably get back from friend. I don‚Äôt want to give out his personal contact info publicly without permission, but message me if you want and I‚Äôll let him know/ask if he‚Äôs cool with me passing it along to you. Thank you so much for the offer of help. <3(edited)"
240,185372613,Edward Demaso,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,1w,"Hi, I live in the building involved and was present from as the fire department arrived to well after everything was put out. I also have photos and videos of almost the entire incident (but not when the fire was actually set unfortunately)."

242,185372613,Charles H.,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NW,3 May,Seems like a hate crime to me.
243,185372613,Ty Rheem,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 May,"Great Edward.  I saw a kid hit by a car on his bicycle once and the story, as relayed on ND, was so far from the truth, it was shocking. Folks posting comments about ‚Äòdrivers‚Äô and ‚Äò23rd‚Äô ....it was clearly the kids fault for blowing a red light. The driver was mortified (happened right in front of me), ambulance arrived, kid was scared to death of getting in trouble ....that was it. "
244,185372613,Doug Bohm,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 days ago,Fictional? Hardly.
245,185372613,Jacob Stamps,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,3 May,Some one lit a fire in the dumpster of our building that same day! Couldn‚Äôt just been a cigarette but it was a giant fire for just a cig!
246,185372613,Andrea Flores,‚Ä¢ Skyland,3 May,"Hello, Andrea Flores with CBS4 here. I am looking to speak with someone who can fill me in a little more about what happened Friday night. Please email me at anflores@cbs.com. Thanks!"
247,185372613,Emily Mandel,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 May,"This is why we have to be very careful about the anti-homeless people rhetoric I see a lot on places like Nextdoor. It can incite some pretty tragic things. Let‚Äôs all look out for each other, everyone. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
248,185372613,Kate' P.,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NW,6 days ago,This is a direct result of the hate the homeless campaigns I see and hear on a regular basis. Both from neighbors on here and even public officials in office. There are few that realize or take into account that our homeless population are still human and have human rights and needs. It's sad but true.
249,185372613,Emily Mandel,‚Ä¢ Hale,6 days ago,Yeah the people on nextdoor and other platforms spewing hate at the homeless are largely responsible for this. I‚Äôm heartbroken.
250,185372613,Ashley Elizabeth,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NE,2 days ago,"Emily M. When you are a single female and have to call the police on men looking through your windows and laying across your door in the am, it has NOTHING to do with nextdoor or anti jobless rhetoric. I joined Nextdoor because I was ALREADY being threatened and needed to feel safer having extra eyes and ears in the neighborhood. It sounds like people who defend dangerous homeless situations don‚Äôt actually live or interact with drug and crime dwelling people on their doorstep."
251,185372613,Lynn En,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill Central,6 days ago,Wonder if this incident is related to the arson incidents that have been popping up all over the cap hill area? I just saw another story about someone lighting cardboard on fire and trying to use it to set fences on fire. Apparently this individual is also setting garbage cans and bushes on fire as well.
252,185372613,Jeff Peshut,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 days ago,"Situations like this are the natural consequence of the failed policies of the Hancock Administration.  In the absence of an effective public safety response to these unsanctioned encampments, people will engage in self-help measures to deal with them."

258,186013338,Jana McSwain,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,4 days ago,"It's your house! These are challenging times for many of us. If you can rent out part of your home to others, it helps you stretch your income AND it provides affordable housing for someone. Looks like a win win to me."

265,186013338,Kathleen Delaney,‚Ä¢ Hudson Street,4 days ago,I don‚Äôt like the multi people in one dwelling because it is backed by developers who only want to make quick money and move on with out putting thought in to what really makes a neighborhood.  Affordable individual housing for people in a regular neighborhood.  Why should a teacher or social worker have to share a kitchen just to make ends meet.  Dorm style living is for college in life we need safe sustainable individual housing
266,186013338,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 days ago,"Teachers and Social Workers can't afford Denver anymore. That's why group living is necessary (also because whenever someone tries to develop affordable units along with a bunch of other units the neighborhood tends to get up in arms about traffic and parking). It'd be nice if a teacher or social worker didn't have to share a kitchen to make ends meet but, well, my brother-in-law and his wife are an architect and a librarian and they were priced out of Denver entirely, could only buy in Wheat Ridge. So yeah I mean I guess if you have a way to build a ton of individual units (probably that'd have to be a high rise), go for it. There's not really undeveloped land in Denver to develop a bunch more single family homes that are close to existing amenities."
267,186013338,Ruthie Johnson,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,23 hr ago,"Kathleen Delaney , I am talking about one house, built 90 years ago. According to zoning,it cannot have two non-related people living in the existing separate two levels."
268,186013338,George Ibarra,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 days ago,"Its one thing when you live in the home and have a renter.  We had the landlord of a house across the street rent to a number (hard to tell how many with all the coming and going) of young men.  We endured months of loud parties in the wee hours, neglected lawn, loose dogs, trash, etc.  Neither the police nor the landlord would do anything."
269,186013338,MayMay McLellan,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 days ago,So what do you complain about when it's the owner's acting like this?

277,186013338,Ruthie Johnson,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,22 hr ago,"Robin Pitt , I don't like those either.  Yet, my neighbors and I are limited in sharing un-used space in our houses because of this bigger fear."
278,186013338,Kate Swan,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4d,"Early on, I thought the SOS people made some reasonable points, but they went pretty far over the deep end as discussions progressed regarding the group housing changes.  Being able to rent out a basement apartment that was already part of your house isn't in the least objectionable to me, but I did worry when the city was talking about allowing 10 unrelated people plus kids to rent a house even smaller than mine.(edited)"
279,186013338,Becky Eich,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 days ago,"If the amendment only increased the number of people allowed to live in a house, I‚Äôd be okay with it - but despite the name ‚Äúgroup living amendment‚Äù the amendment contains verbiage that will allow more halfway homes and correctional facilities (called ‚Äúresidential care facilities‚Äù) to open in our neighborhoods- possibly next door to you.  I‚Äôm not going to argue with you if you think that‚Äôs okay.  I‚Äôve done the research on recidivism and I prefer to not live nextdoor to a halfway home or correctional facility.

290,182618509,Gina Dunn,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,8 Apr,"They have to shut it down because it is a mess. If you have been near/in the downtown area this past year, it is also a sty. I pass it every time I go to visit my mom. It's  on many street corners. They have to keep moving it around because it gets so nasty and dangerous. Why? Because the people who live there will not keep it clean/safe and the city of Denver lets it  happen ! I don't know who would want to visit this city when it is like this.  I don't go downtown unless I have to. My out of town friends have seen the mess on the national media."

344,181197610,Brian Bostron,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,24 Mar,Evan:  I would have done the same thing but it is not wise to confront someone these days.  They could have had a weapon. It is difficult to not run after someone but please be careful.  Your safety is worth more.  
345,181197610,Jesus Barraza,‚Ä¢ Hale,24 Mar,You got it all  on your security camera right?
346,181197610,Evan Lockhart Borman,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Mar,"We got some footage from the neighbors. Installed a nest cam in the garage, in case the perp comes back."
347,181197610,Jesus Barraza,‚Ä¢ Hale,28 Mar,Evan Lockhart Borman that's the conversation we had on a previous  post on here. It was about  a truck getting the toolbox broken into. I commented that people who get their house  or garage broken into don't usually have video cameras until after the fact. But why not get them before? Thieves  go for the vulnerable house. They don't  go where  the dog will bite same applies with cameras. Lets get our cameras before we get robbed. Doing so will help not you  but your neighbor.  I'm glad u got cameras now. May I suggest arlo pro4.  They have a spot light  and work with wifi. They are the best I've gotten.  Ok. Going back to bed now. Good night.
348,181197610,Barbara Ruley,‚Ä¢ City Park,24 Mar,"For those that may want their stolen possessions back and I want to emphasize that this is a long shot but I was privy to how the underground works in the homeless camp.  At least the one in front of the Capital building.  A friend and myself were handing out food and toiletries to the homeless.  My friend put her phone down for a second and it was gone in a second.  I offered a $100 reward for its return no questions asked.  A woman came forward and said she would help us find our phone.  Around midnight everyone gathers and sells the items that they stole during the day.  It worked, my friend got her phone back in seconds."
349,181197610,Chris Doyle,‚Ä¢ City Park,24 Mar,Your message just enlighten me!  I had no idea that many of the homeless are stealing and reselling items within their homeless communities... really quite sad üò¢!

365,182732086,Jeff Winchester,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,I couldn‚Äôt agree more! This is very disturbing news.
366,182732086,Samantha Robles,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Apr,Time to move. Disgusting
367,182732086,Valerie Carter,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Apr,From the article: Chandler said the collaborative has been in contact with the local neighborhood organizations including Greater Park Hill Community Inc. and will host two community meetings in May to provide more details about the site. The collaborative is also inviting people to tour the existing site on Pearl Street to see how they operate.
368,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Don‚Äôt care how they operate on pearl street... don‚Äôt want it on montview street
369,182732086,Michael Davis,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,"Are you familiar with the monitored homeless camp downtown by the capital? If not, please do your research, it will basically be the same thing.  It isnt a tent city with zero supervision."
370,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,"Really... yes I am familiar and also familiar with the dirty needles, filth, unsafe and unsanitary conditions!  Why don‚Äôt you volunteer to put it in your back yard?"
371,182732086,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,"As a volunteer with the Women's Homelessness Initiative and after many visits to the 14th & Grant site to deliver food and water, it is well operated. One of my fellow Park Hill UCC church members volunteered overnight there from 11 pm to 3am, and she, a physician, says it was orderly. The fence is tall, and there is a locked gate. If we need extra monitoring around the perimeter, let's talk with the PH Methodist Church about this as well as determine if additional monitoring is necessary. We can also have our Forest Avenue Parkway patrolled if people are concerned. Ultimately, people using this SOS site are like us and deserve safe shelter until other options are available in our severely overpriced and underserved city. Where else do these people go? The SOS site is safe, quiet, and well managed. We all want safe neighborhoods and living spaces. If there is a concern with what is around it, then contact the local police precinct for additional patrols. The people within the SOS site are peaceful. It is a 6 month permit. Also keep in mind that Senator Hickenlooper resides 1.5 blocks from it. Since we can't build affordable housing fast enough, where do unhoused neighbors go?"
372,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Please!
373,182732086,Patty Moody,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,How much is the collaborative group paying this church?  Also are they ensuring no sex offenders are living by the school?  Needle disposals?  üò°
374,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Absolutely!  Great question
375,182732086,Jim Miller,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,7 Apr,Take a walk up Park from Colfax to Larimer..and then back on 22nd. That is what will be coming to your neighborhood
376,182732086,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,7 Apr,"How about 14th close to downtown? Right on the sidewalks , in front of homes and businesses. I wouldn't feel safe walking down there , nor having my kids walk down there"
377,182732086,Michael Davis,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,I highly encourage all to find out how these people qualify.  It took almost 30 days to fill the camp on Grant.  Not just everyone can come in whenever they want.
378,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Qualify?  Who cares about qualification... just don‚Äôt want it period!
379,182732086,Debra Roads,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,7 Apr,Go visit the tent camp on Pearl street. The tent camp is run really well and the residents are so nice. My neighbors and I have made dinner and delivered it to their 40 residents.  I live in Congress Park and would be so proud if we would do this too.

381,182732086,Scott Bulfin,‚Ä¢ Central Park,7 Apr,"It doesn't make you a bad or uncaring person to not want a homeless camp where you live. It is a serious issue that needs to be resolved and rotating these camps from Denver neighborhood to neighborhood is not a solution, just a bandaid. I would suggest the city of Denver take the $100 million  it is getting from the economic windfall boost of getting the 2021 MLB ALL-STAR game from Atlanta and now to Denver and invest it in solving the revolving homeless camp issue. Also all cities/states are getting a windfall from Biden's 2 trillion aid package, so some of that surplus can go to tackling the homeless camp issue."
382,182732086,Heather Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Seems like Hancock would want to cleanup the downtown area before the ALL STAR game so I predict we‚Äôll see more of this moving into neighborhoods.
383,182732086,Erin Pier,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,7 Apr,"There was a homeless man who used to wander around my block. I‚Äôd see him from time to time and we‚Äôd chat. He was one of the kindest people I‚Äôve ever met...former PTA president at one of our neighborhood schools, and the father of three successful adults - one rather well known. He was brilliant, but ill, and our country failed to meet his needs. So he wound up sorting through my dumpster looking for scrap metal to make ends meet. "
384,182732086,Jeff Winchester,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Wake up Erin.  Because we don‚Äôt want human feces and needles next door to a preschool is not too much to ask. This is BS and you know it! Yes Denver is an expensive city to live in. Guess what? Other places are more affordable. They live here because suckers like you enable them. Shame on you.
385,182732086,Melody Hodges,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Apr,"Some people work awfully hard to hold onto their preconceived notions, even when faced with evidence they are wrong.  So sad to see such closed minds, so much unfounded fear and the unwillingness to learn or contribute."
386,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,What does that even mean? You do not know me or my past contributions to society!  I am all about helping others!   The issue is we are exposing innocent children and families to something they did not choose to be exposed to!  Wasn‚Äôt our/their choice.. that‚Äôs the issue!  We all deserve to have a choice and say in our lives...
387,182732086,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Apr,So where would you like to home them?
388,182732086,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Apr,"Jeff Farquhar  I  Myself no Jeff. I have a roof over my head. but you are the same people who go don't pay rent. Pay housekeepers a $100000 a year to clean their homes. We the people, Find a solution. You go poor people until it comes to your house.  There are schools in every neighborhood. There are young children in every neighborhood. Find a solution. Work together to find a way to get these people off the drugs that need help. Work programs. It will get worse before it gets better. Find ways to help instead of being a just not on my door complainer!"
389,182732086,Jan Delsi,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Apr,"I am also concerned, if the legislators think this is such a wonderful idea, then they should have them set up the camps near their homes, not ours!!!"
390,182732086,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,It‚Äôs near Senator Hickenlooper‚Äôs home.
391,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,"Don‚Äôt know.. your backyard?  Not mine or our local church, or nearby neighbors.  Don‚Äôt know the answer.. it‚Äôs sucks, feel bad for all.  Think ultimately up to our local gov, but they only push this kind of crap through under radar without most knowing anything about it.. is that ok?  No it is not.  I am done bitching, no real solution other than voicing our opinion..  Good luck to all with this terrible situation"
392,182732086,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Stop complaining and misinforming. Do your homework and be part of the solution.
393,182732086,Jeff Farquhar,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,7 Apr,Patricia Smith I‚Äôm about done with your misinforming. We aren‚Äôt idiots!! We‚Äôve seen these camps! See ya at the tour on May 1st Pattie.

395,182732086,Ingrid Underwood,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4w,It‚Äôs a catch22.  I understand the homeless situation must be addressed.  We have spoken to several homeless people living in their cars and watched the documentary Tent City USA.  
396,182732086,Max Blanchard,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,4w,"I want to thank Patricia Smith and Michael Davis for the information they provided about the safe outdoor space. I think it‚Äôs fair to be apprehensive but from what I have read about the official outdoor space in Cap Hill, it sounds like it was successful in helping people escape homelessness. And the concerns people had at the start were squashed once the program began. Trying to avoid the not in my backyard mentality (NIMBYism) can be tough, but I‚Äôm happy to know our city is at least trying to help people.(edited)"
397,182732086,Melody Hodges,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Apr,"Thinking the camp at the church will be like the camp at Morley is comparing apples and oranges.  Why the difference is so difficult to comprehend is beyond me.  More camps like the one at the church means fewer camps like Morley.  That's the whole point of this, to help people while keeping them safe from the neighborhood and vice versa.  The reality is that the homeless keep coming and the problem will most likely get worse before it gets better once the eviction moratorium is lifted.  People need hope to recover and the sanctioned camps offer that.  Without hope, people turn to drugs and other activities that drag them into places like the camp at Morley.  They're not necessarily bad people, just people that have had bad things happen to them.  It's not right to deny them the opportunity to pull themselves out of a dire situation by denying them a camp like the sanctioned ones which offer hope and a way out, and instead warehouse them somewhere where you don't have to see them.  This camp isn't being placed in Park Hill to punish the neighborhood - I believe the intent it to spread them throughout the city so all neighborhoods share in the recovery."
398,182732086,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,8 Apr,"I agree there is no comparison to SOS and Morey. It's important that we determine how to avoid that situation, and also to keep in mind how we can show how it's possible to make this work."

Anyone remember the Ghost Post program from 1993/1994? This is the Park Hill I know and where I am proud to live. People have come together for decades, and we are again capable of this. Who participated in the Ghost Post program to keep Halloween safe? The first year we did it, we had brick mobile phones (1994), which my boss donated in the days she worked at Cellular One so each block could immediately report a disturbance.

425,182464076,Lee Farver,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Apr,"Before People call me ""Privileged"" I grew up poor.  My parents had me when they were 18 and we lived in trailer parks as well as an actual camper when I was young.  My parents didn't do drugs, they just had kids too young with no money. They didn't use excuses, they didn't take any handouts, they worked their butts off and saved every penny that didn't go to supporting their kids.  They taught me and my brother what hard work could do.  When I first moved to Denver I moved to the highlands when things were still rough.  I had compassion and would give food or a few bucks to the homeless that sat out on the corners around the major intersections in the neighborhood. That compassion soon faded as I would head out on a run down the cherry creek trail every evening after work and see the same people i tried to help talking to drug dealers on that same trail or literally had needles in their arms as i ran by.  I had my first kid living in that house in the highlands and didn't feel safe running with a stroller down the cherry creek trail with her in it.  As much as i loved that house and neighborhood I CHOSE to move to Park hill for a more stable and safe environment.  So now that I feel like a choice was made for my neighborhood without any consideration i can be angry.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for many of years.  There are jobs out there people even during this pandemic. However, you have to be reliable, hard working, and straight.  So before you all start judging me I will pose this offer.  For any of you that believe this is a good thing and support decisions like this being made without any neighborhood involvement my offer is this:  I will buy anyone that is willing to have a homeless family camp in their back yard for a period of time a nice tent, i'll pay for the utilities, and some additional amenities if you're willing to put my money where your mouth is and support these same people living in your backyard.  Because honestly, the parking lot is in the backyard of people that live on that street."

427,182464076,Lee Farver,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,11 Apr,Still no takers to my offer on my original post?  That‚Äôs what I thought!!!
428,182464076,Eve Cohen,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,11 Apr,"You are being ridiculous. The point of the SOS‚Äôs (as you would know if you had read the description of them, which you clearly have not), is that it‚Äôs not just sticking someone in a tent in a backyard (or parking lot); it‚Äôs connecting them to services such as mental health counseling, job training, and housing resources, providing showers, bathrooms, heating, and electricity, and the end goal is transitioning these people into permanent housing, which the project has had enormous success with. Many of the people housed in the SOS‚Äôs actually have jobs, they just don‚Äôt make enough to be able to afford rent, which, if you‚Äôve looked at Denver rents lately, you‚Äôd understand why.  Please educate yourself about what this project is and how it works before vocalizing your prejudices and preconceptions."

437,180176476,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,15 Mar,"Because there was a vote about it recently - to end the ""urban camping ban"" or not.  Educating voters might mean a different result if it comes up again."

It literally says ‚Äúallow people to remain where they are‚Äù and to help set up these sanitation services. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, we should follow the cdc guidance to help people instead of just forcing them from place to place."

I feel stupid asking this question, but how can we help in the future? To prevent this and to help those in need? I always hear conflicting messages, so if anyone has direct ways that we can support the homeless community, especially in times of extreme weather, please let me know."
448,178948262,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,3 Mar,"Becky Robinson I gather warm clothes, bedding & household items and take them to 2 shelters regularly if you have something to donate. Also call or email Mayor Hancock who still refuses to help the homeless and tell him how you feel. 10 years of fighting  him & city council is tiring me out."
449,178948262,LInda Poletti,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 Mar,What a kind face and beautiful smile.  I didn't know about him and his story but thank you to all of the kind people who help him and others and thank you Virginia and Lynn for honoring him by letting us all know. This makes me very very sad.
450,178948262,Dereck Blackford,‚Ä¢ City Park,3 Mar,We as a community need to do something about this ... I myself found myself stuck with my car keys locked the car the other night. ... Trying to get the door open i almost froze so i can only imagine

452,178948262,Dereck Blackford,‚Ä¢ City Park,3 Mar,We need to organize and set up a structure of some sort at designated locations with some type of blankets or heaters hand warmers etc and have it open during the coldest temperatures or some type of hotline even to call if u r in need ... Has anyone called 911 before for this type of situation can u imagine trying to tell someone u need help but cant get it this makes my.heart hurt so much we live in a time like this
453,178948262,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,3 Mar,"Hancock is finally sending outreach workers to the camps to get them help. They can get warm @ St Francis Center & get warm clothes there & at Samaritan House where they may find shelter. Not enough, but I can take donations here as I  have been doing.  Let me be the clearing house."
454,178948262,Carl & Lisa Bird,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,9w,My son took David breakfast burritos each morning and was wondering where he was. I stupidly assumed that when the temps dropped public agencies would come pick up homeless and take them to temporary warm shelter. For someone to die from the cold! No words. üíî(edited)
455,178948262,Brianna Carlson,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,3 Mar,This is incredibly sad.  Unfortunately no one can make a person go into shelter. There are shelters for people experiencing homelessness.  Many people choose not to go for different reasons.  Shelters have been open 24/7 since the beginning of March 2020. This breaks my heart.
456,178948262,Kate Johnston,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,3 Mar,"For folks asking how to help, there are some mutual aid networks doing great work. Denver Homeless Out Loud is a good place to start... I'm sure if you reach out they can let you know what they need in terms of donations, volunteers, etc."

458,178948262,Kammy Alford,‚Ä¢ City Park West,3 Mar,"I sat and talked with David when I brought him some hot soup and other items.  He was an extremely soft and well spoken man.  He did have a delightful smile that came from within.  Virginia, Lynn and others can fill you in if they choose, but David refused to go to any shelter.  Many tried brainstorming to come up with ways to help him..  He also gave away many items that were given to him, ""because I had too much"".  I think he thought that others were worse off than he was.  When I spoke with him, he never complained about anything.  I too am crying over David's tragic death, but I like to think that his struggles are over and he is nice and warm now with everything he needs and could ever want."
459,178948262,Katie Warnke,‚Ä¢ Five Points North,4 Mar,He looks young and hardy in this picture. How old was he? It‚Äôs so sad someone like this and anyone should die alone outside in the freezing cold.

463,178948262,Carl Bird,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,3 Mar,"This is just so sad I can't find words.  As Lisa mentions above, my son cooked a burrito for David every day.  Checking in w him was a part of my son's every day routine.  He got to know him as a friend, was surprised how young, intelligent & kind hearted he was.  He wasn't interested in going to a shelter, said he was used to the cold & had been ""doing fine"" there for a year. Maybe he was fearful, maybe it was pride. I don't know what else to say as I sit here in the comfort of my warm house."
464,178948262,Virginia Cahenzli,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,3 Mar,"David was a giver, a true kind and gentle human being wanting to do good  for others even when he was at the lowest point in his life.  "

470,178948262,Kirsten Barnard,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 Mar,"I have watched this thread for awhile and hoped so much David would accept help from an equipped agency.  But, he was well cared for by the neighborhood bakers, mitten givers, soup, burrito and tea makers and mental health experts and kind and loving people who saw him and treated him as a human being.  The absolute compassion shown by you all was truly a portrait of love.  While systems failed this soul hearts did not.  Thank you all for your loving care of David."

It's been awesome to see how quickly any need is responded to.  Often by more than a few offering to help. It's awesome to see people put aside all other considerations (race/religion/politics/social status) and just be neighbors and Americans.

It's well known of, and I believe that I read in the past that a smaller part of the work to be done, a hope, is that the disturbance of the construction combined with other efforts toward remedying homelessness about town, might break the gathering of persons there, and of course increase the visitors enjoying the area."

581,180121987,Charles T.,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,14 Mar,I can understand letting people know about the shelters being open but in reality if you're homeless how would they get this post? As for the rest of your post it is common sense. I have been capable of making it through life for many many years without the need for the government telling me how to do things as have many others. Why would I take advice from the government when they can't manage nor spend money wisely. I could go into many areas where the government is lacking from the city to the federal level. The main purpose of government is to protect the citizens but currently the government seems to think they are in the business of running our lives and making money.

591,176394998,Dawn Holden,‚Ä¢ City Park West,9 Feb,"As I had coffee with a firefighter this morning we discussed this. As the article states the homeless are three times more likely to be hospitalized due to Covid. Therefore, taxing the hospital system and tax dollars to pay for their care. He stated that they have so so so many calls handling homeless situations that this is a no brainer. Most of these people are un-masked also. We both agreed to keep beds open at hospitals and not have needless tax dollars spent on care that could be alleviated due to a vaccine - we are both for it. Also, homeless or not they‚Äôre human beings and deserve protection too."

597,185940515,Meridith Hertach,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,5 days ago,The only description she gave me was what I posted.  Our building doesn't have security cameras but you can bet I emailed our HOA board and it will be addressed at our next meeting.  Hoping someone else may have him on camera.  I think he was mentally disturbed and homeless.

He was wearing baggy clothes with his hood up and was carrying a duffel bag. He was walking on the sidewalk on the same side that I was running with my dog, and pretended to fall into the street when I got close to him (it was very clear he didn‚Äôt trip or anything). I got a bad vibe from him and I could tell he was fine so I kept running, and he then proceeded to yell at me for not helping him and tried to get me to approach him. Luckily a couple turned onto the street at the same time this was happening and he got up and left. I felt very scared/uncomfortable after that, but glad I trusted my instincts. Thank goodness your neighbor is okay!!(edited)"
606,185940515,Meridith Hertach,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,5 days ago,Good Job trusting your instincts!!  He is clearly targeting women.
607,185940515,Liza Anne S. DeJulio,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,5 days ago,I hope this was reported this the CCN Association because it‚Äôs my understanding there‚Äôs a security agency that patrols the area. It‚Äôs also worth reporting to the police dept for awareness rather than wait for something awful to happen.

As I was not the one who experienced the incident I could only go off what my friend shared.  She was incredibly shaken but you wouldn't know what its like being a woman attacked.  I thought it was important to share what happened ASAP and give the details I had.  I'm sure you would be out looking for him if there was more, Larry.  Location, sex, dress, time of day... those were the details I had and it was enough to determine another incident only 2 hours prior."
612,185940515,marcia jones,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,4 days ago,"To emphasize Sydney's statement...it has been discovered that screaming police causes people to make a conscious decision NOT to get involved; however, screaming fire brings peoples awareness that THEIR lives could also be in danger.  When an individual feels their lives (or better yet) their possessions are in danger they pay attention."
613,172600619,Steve Mast,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,3 Jan,Have seen him.  Pretty sure is homeless.  Last time saw him he had started a fire in alley on east side of Congress.  Fire dept had to come and put out.

He was very polite, very articulate and very firm that he wanted nothing. Said he was just waiting for the sun to come up. He was wearing a good mask, so he gets help somewhere."
618,172600619,Leah Schroeder,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,3 Jan,His name is John. I helped him tuck some blankets under his legs and around his body. He started to tear up when I asked if he needed anything. He said no. 
619,172600619,Chris Lyn,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 Jan,I mean this without sarcasm; it sounds like someone should get John some reflective tape for his wheelchair.

625,172600619,Steve Mast,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,4 Jan,"been lots of response to this.  I should correct my 1st comment - it was actually my neighbor who saw him in alley by Congress park and saw fire.  My ""first hand"" sightings have been 9th & Detroit St & numerous on 7th.  My concern is for him but also not having fires!"

630,172600619,Marcia Canepa,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,4 Jan,"He was staying in Pulaski Park most of last week. Spoke with him and actually told me his name is ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù. Lost his legs to frost bite. Born and raised here in Denver. Kind and very articulate. Ask if we could get him a warm sleeping bag. We talked about what type would work best because of his amputations. So a few of us got him a ‚Äúhalf bag‚Äù with suspenders to hold it up and a fleece liner...he wasn‚Äôt at the park yesterday. We are bringing the bag to Congress Park today to try to find him to give it to him. Such a sad, difficult situation..."
631,172600619,Carol Martin,‚Ä¢ City Park West,4 Jan,That is a wonderful thing you folks did. Hope you find him soon.
632,172600619,Desiree Flynn,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,4 Jan,I gave him my sandwich once and he about cried. He lives in my neighborhood and is super nice. I literally insisted he took the sandwich and he smiled so big. Keep being nice to people! ‚ù§Ô∏è

637,172600619,Ginnie Eldredge,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,4 Jan,"We have seen him often; he seems to have good and bad days.  He seems mostly resistant to help.  He is not responsive to my amazingly kind hearted husband; a bit more to me but often refuses help.  Allan ~ I hope you can help, maybe a female volunteer.  Let us all know if we can help too.  He has such sad eyes."
638,172600619,Allison Johnson,‚Ä¢ Country Club,4 Jan,I walk up/down 7th avenue and have seen him often.  From now on I will bring protein bars with me.
639,172600619,Chris Lyn,‚Ä¢ Hale,7 Jan,Thanks for thinking of this! Please be aware of the consistency of bars; many of those in need can‚Äôt chew as well as they would like.

642,172600619,Sabrina M.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,9 Jan,I have tried to use the coalition for the homeless before and all they do is help feel out applications for apartments that have a year+ waiting list. Maybe he is a veteran?

645,183413392,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Apr,I'm a member of this group and everyone is a volunteer like me! Just concerned citizens that feel like our voices are being ignored.  I'm volunteering this weekend to gather signatures. How is gathering signatures to put something so serious on the ballot for a public vote shaddy or underhanded? We feel the City Council's refusal to listen to their constituents was shaddy!

652,183413392,Lee Farver,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Apr,Sounds to me like it gives the community more of a voice then what a select few decide is right.
653,183413392,Ryan Hernandez,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Apr,"Nope, that‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs about"
654,183413392,Ruth Wagner,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Apr,Can‚Äôt make that date and time...other options?
655,183413392,Lisa Ramos,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Apr,"Nobody's voices were ignored. Common sense and decency prevailed.

657,183413392,Dana Smart,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,3w,"Wende Reoch so the 85% plus residents of Denver who opposed this bill are racist, bigoted assholes? Again, these are separate issues. The last I checked, the United States isn‚Äôt a socialist country. We elect people to represent us no dictate over us.  This is how government is supposed to work in our country. My intent above was and is  to point out factual realities about how our govt is supposed to operate in our country. Mixing emotional arguments and personal perceptions with facts rarely leads to a productive dialog. Yes this issue is emotional and at the same time we have a constitution, laws and other rational means in place to assure that all voices are heard and represented. I also shared above, it is impossible to offer any solution that all will be happy with as is evident here. The point of this petition is to give all residents of Denver the right to vote on this amendment that will greatly impact the city. 11 people should not have that much power over our community. You too will have the right to vote as you feel is best for the community. Finally, to make the assumption that anyone who doesn‚Äôt support this amendment is a racist bigot is actually a racist and bigoted comment as it makes sweeping assumptions about a large group of people without even knowing them. This approach also stops productive conversation from happening and keeps people divided.(edited)"

Thank goodness civil rights and human rights are not up to popular votes. We would be a very different society if we had to wait for human decency to become popular. Learn some US history already- civil rights were ushered in by protests, endless appeals in the courts, and the votes of elected officials who were made to feel pressure. We‚Äôd still be waiting if a popular vote was required."

669,183413392,Dana Smart,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,17 Apr,"There is no opposition to having these group homes throughout the city, just not in single family zoned areas where transportation and services would be limited."
670,183413392,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3w,"Dana Smart there are already integrated homes, and there are services. This is another method of redlining.

If you want to be concerned  about funding I would suggest you look at the big developers who bank rolled Michael Hancock for the last three cycles he has been in office. They are the ones who have destroyed our city, filled it with expensive housing, destroyed city park, intend to tear up I 70 and the Swansea a L Myra neighborhood to add more luxury development and have left our Airoirt in shambles to create shopping . Much of our present situation has been the continuation of keeping this person in office and allowing the developers to bank roll what has now created a problem in our city."

681,179050512,Llew Haden,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,4 Mar,"Nolan, you are right on the money.  And things are only going to get worse.  Under the banner of stopping police brutality, our elected officials have chosen to throw the baby out with the bath water.  Instead of dealing with the issue, which is difficult, the easy way to look like the problem is being addressed is to cut budget. Helps with city/county strained budgets in tough times also."
682,179050512,Daniel Letendre,‚Ä¢ Hale,4 Mar,Did you read about the budget cut and what it is about? Or are you assuming that its due to police brutality.

The issue is there‚Äôs not enough bandwidth for anyone, police officer or not, to show up and investigate/ prevent these crimes. If we had police alternatives who could come help prevent crime thatd be awesome. We just have nobody showing up so criminals just get to keep committing crimes"

690,179050512,Ruthie Johnson,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,4 Mar,"If social and economic systems were stronger for people in the lower income bandwidth of our community,  if society promoted the abundance available to us, instead of highlighting lack and competion, we would naturally have less crime and need for police."
691,179050512,Nolan Albrecht,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,4 Mar,"Yeah I agree entirely, but I was just merely highlighting the fact that a lot of people are complaining about a lack of representation from police officers and I was highlighting the most likely reasons.

693,179050512,Andrew Sweet,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,4 Mar,Perhaps we can all look at raising taxes folks. It‚Äôs the way a community supports these services. Without revenue cuts will continue. Write Polis and Hancock- Polis wanted to pursue a tax cut (!). Not helpful.

Cuts are inevitable across the board.  Did the police brutality coverage have an impact on the budget?  I""m not sure but I suspect that was in the conversation.  I never supported defunding police as I still want them around, more focused should have been on on fixing the problem.  We swing left to right (not politically) and vice versa too often in today's environment and the answer is usually somewhere in between."

702,179050512,April Link,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,4 Mar,There are a number of crimes DPD does not send out an officer for and it‚Äôs been like that for years.  Particularly property type crimes without a known suspect and you complete the report online.  If your car is broken into why is it necessary to have an officer come out?  I suggest attending city council meetings when they‚Äôre discussing and voting on the subject.  Last year you could attend via zoom and request time to talk about issues and concerns.  Also contact your city council official.

718,184908340,Florence S.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,28 Apr,"Interesting article this morning in BusinessDen. It appears the City is headed toward outsource and contract (again) with a quasi-municipal corporation and a land-banking non-profit. This model of outsourcing is certainly lucrative for the contractors, but the bill to taxpayers keeps increasing and the outcomes do not appear satisfactory. "

720,183319453,Jeffrey Sturman,‚Ä¢ City Park West,13 Apr,Over what time period? I think the city budget is $2 billion a year. I also wonder what portion of the above is federal or donated dollars.
721,183319453,Paige Burkeholder,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park East,20 Apr,"Jeffrey Sturman I think that article referenced City money (which some maybe Federal). Either of those are monies we put in with our hard earned dollars through taxes.

746,180511781,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,18 Mar,I wonder if they are doing this because a lot of states send animals to Colorado shelters specifically because of the no kill policy.
747,180511781,Julie Gutman,‚Ä¢ Lowry,19 Mar,You can't just 'send' an animal to Colorado from another state. A shelter or rescue group has to accept the animals into their care. The reason animals come to Colorado is because we have a very low number of homeless pet.
748,180511781,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,19 Mar,"Julie Gutman of course a transfer must be requested, but shelters in other states pick Colorado because of the no kill operations in the state."
749,180511781,Lara Selvaggi,‚Ä¢ Hale,18 Mar,I'd actually like to know why they feel this bill is necessary as well - what is happening now that they are trying to fix?

757,180511781,Susan Grey,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,18 Mar,Read the bill people.  There is nothing here that would make shelters like Max fund close.  Here is the summary from the Colorado government website.  
758,180511781,Chris Simpson,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,18 Mar,I signed it...
759,180511781,Mark Kaplan,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,18 Mar,"Thank you for all of the thoughtful and passionate postings on this topic. They all appear to have a positive intent behind them. However, I would like to clarify an important point, and it is the reason that the no kill community is overwhelmingly opposed to this bill. The current wording of the bill on its face appears to be harmless, and it is accurate that it does not require any shelter to euthanize any dog or cat. However, it is important to understand that the adoption of any dog or cat would be prohibited unless it is ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. ‚ÄùHealthy‚Äù is defined as a dog or cat that ‚Äúexhibits no signs of illness or injury or exhibits signs of illness or injury for which there is a realistic prognosis for a good quality of life.‚Äù ‚ÄúSafe‚Äù is defined as a dog or cat that ‚Äúhas not exhibited behavior that is likely to result in bodily injury or death to another animal or human being.‚Äù MaxFund‚Äôs mission and reason for existence is to take in and care for these sick, neglected and abused dogs and cats and, once they have been rehabilitated, adopt them to loving families. MaxFund has successfully been doing this for almost 40 years and I have seen it happen with hundreds of dogs. Many, if not most, of the animals that MaxFund takes in exhibit signs of illness or injury, and many of the dogs initially exhibit behavior that is likely to result in bodily injury or death to another animal or human being. The whole point is that no kill rescues and shelters like MaxFund treat the animals so that they can overcome these issues (which frequently are caused by human neglect). The current wording of the bill would prohibit the adoption of most of the dogs and many of the cats that MaxFund takes in. Regardless of the intent of the bill, that would be the effect. There is no requirement that all rescues and shelters operate with a no kill philosophy, but the shelters and rescues that are willing and able to use their financial and human resources for that purpose should be allowed to do so."

799,173702686,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Jan,"It started with the mayor but is now being steam rolled through with Andrew Webb from CPD and your City Council person, Chris Hinds. They are the people you need to contact immediately as they plan to make it even worse by approving a homeless shelter or a corrections facility on any block with the new zoning they plan to vote on Feb 8th."
800,173702686,Steve Nicholls,‚Ä¢ City Park West,13 Jan,I grew up across the street. I know the family tried to hold on the property for years. My parents‚Äô house was gutted. All the original built-in bookcases and credenzas ripped out. Sold for some obnoxious price. It‚Äôs definitely a different neighborhood than the one I remember.
801,173702686,Andrea Stanton,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Jan,I am so sorry to hear this - such a beautiful house. I walk by it multiple times per week because it is so lovely. Does anyone know how this got approval from the landmarks commission?
802,173702686,Susan Hobbins,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Jan,"As far as I know, that address is not in a landmark district. I‚Äôm pretty sure the 7th Ave historic district ends at 8th Ave. Unless it has changed recently."
803,173702686,Andrea Stanton,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14 Jan,Susan Hobbins Thank you for the clarification! I mis-remembered the boundaries.
804,173702686,Maureen Flander,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Jan,"This has always been a beautiful home and garden. In the 1960s it was part of a garden tour. It was also where all the kids on the block played baseball, kickball etc.  So much history goneüò¢"

806,173702686,Barb Lamb,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,13 Jan,What a shame!  Years ago I lived at 830 St. Paul and always thought 831 across the street was the most beautiful.
807,173702686,Susan Hobbins,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Jan,"I too have always loved that property. But, this is a private home. The owners decided to sell. After all, many people use the sale of the old family home to find retirement in a new,smaller place. We don‚Äôt know the reason but it would be a very rare owner who stipulates that the home must remain as is. I know nothing about the sellers or buyers - but the zoning of this double (triple?) lot allows something something new to be built. "
808,173702686,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Jan,"Beware of what you think is going to be built,"

810,173702686,Vicki Kelley,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Jan,"So very sad.  Not to add to this sad story, but we have heard that the vacant house (double lot) on the next street over (8th & Steele SE corner) was purchased by a questionable developer for a song from the surviving family (estate) and he plans to make an AirBnb and build what a neighbor described as a ""beach house"" (whatever that is) on the lot right on the corner at 8th Avenue."

814,173702686,Gwynne Hollis,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Jan,Does anyone know if this house was ever for sale publicly? I never saw a for sale sign but perhaps missed it. So sad.
815,173702686,Marc Spear,‚Ä¢ Country Club,14 Jan,"No. It appears to be s private sale, no MLS listing."
816,173702686,Dorothy Walter,‚Ä¢ Country Club,13 Jan,"Greed and no sense of history.  A horrible price to pay for getting properties designated as protected for their historical value.  Surprised there wasn‚Äôt some form of notice, even on a chain link fence, so concerned people could act.  Thanks for sharing."
817,173702686,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,13 Jan,I just googled it and it's pretty but the estimate on Zillow said 1.7 million. A single family can't afford that. I'd be surprised if anyone bought it besides a developer.
818,173702686,Krystal MacDonald,‚Ä¢ City Park West,14 Jan,1.7 is nothing for the wealthy in Denver (of which there are many). While I‚Äôm disappointed the new owners don‚Äôt respect the home it‚Äôs entirely possible it‚Äôs a single family.
819,173702686,Stacy Oh,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jan,"When I was selling my 1886-built house on Lincoln (the only double lot on the block), my neighbors rallied & formed a LLC and bought & restored it. They didn't want it to be scraped. Channel 9 reported on it. That block is now a historical district, which took years, but now no house on the block can be razed. "
820,173702686,Bo S.,‚Ä¢ Alamo Placita,14 Jan,I am unfamiliar with the history of your place but say bravo to the neighbors who created a win-win result and to you for your part in achieving the result
821,173702686,Marc Spear,‚Ä¢ Country Club,14 Jan,"That's awesome. This appears to have been a private sale, no MLS listing, and likely no opportunity for the neighbors at act similarly."
822,173702686,Greg Gibb,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,14 Jan,"It seems just like the greater world, there is a lot of anger being demonstrated here from assumptions based on zero or minimal research to the facts."
823,173702686,Connie Jenni,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jan,Do you know why they are tearing it down? Does it have structural problems perhaps? I‚Äôm just interested.
824,173702686,Maureen Flander,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14 Jan,It was in great shape structurally

841,173689307,Sean Sanchez,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,14 Jan,Honestly there are not a lot of safe places (shelters) to go to for these folks during covid. Have some understanding as to why this is happening and cut them some slack. We are all in this together.
842,173689307,Chris Platt,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,14 Jan,That doesn't seem to be the case according to this article: https://www.denverpost.com/2021/01/12/mike-coffman-homeless-aurora/
843,173689307,Kris Vogel,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14 Jan,your article is informative.  while i agree COVID has made this more challenging.  I also support each and every measure on our ballots to support our fellow citizens.  it is frustrating to know there are services there that aren't being accessed.
844,173689307,Don McDonald,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,17 Jan,Why haven‚Äôt there been widespread COVID outbreaks in the homeless camps?
845,173689307,Kaylee Simms,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,22 Jan,"Don McDonald there have been. But the city doesn‚Äôt have any other options for them so, hand sanitizer and bathrooms have been placed in many of the camps."
846,173689307,Don McDonald,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,17 Jan,It‚Äôs only going to get worse. 
847,173689307,Chris Platt,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,19 Jan,Chapter 59 exemptions should be 100% done away with. Why should Green Valley Ranch get to nix homeless camps while the rest of the city bears the burden?
848,173689307,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,19 Jan,"The crazed no-holds-barred zoning, except CH 59 neighborhoods (Hilltop...). is being voted on Feb 8th by City Council.  If you want some say in what happens in your neighborhood, contact your city counil person."
849,173689307,Wende Reoch,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15w,I don't consider Hilltop a great example of the former  Chapter 59 zoning designation neighborhood - there are only a couple of fairly small properties that are still in that code. There are plenty of other neighborhoods that are better examples - Lowry for one. It is good and easy to get the facts straight in this era of misinformation.  Lots of places to confirm this including the CPD website.(edited)

I do appreciate the discussion as I continue to refine how best to contribute to this very complex issue. In the short term, I agree the blue bird, paradise cleaner parking lot, and the adjacent alley is not the solution."
852,175643330,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,1 Feb,you‚Äôll find that a lot of the specious claims about this amendment are carefully addressed by the documents on the city website linked above
853,175643330,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,1 Feb,"Steve, Of course. It‚Äôs their ‚Äúsales brochure‚Äù.... And many valid and objective issues are very gray or not addressed at all."
854,175643330,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,1 Feb,what issues are not addressed at all?
855,175643330,Chris Platt,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,1 Feb,Chapter 59 Exemptions are still barely being addressed. Pretty disappointed to see an amendment all about equity and fairness leave 20% of the city out.
856,175643330,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,1 Feb,"the Chapter 59 issue (properties still under the ""old"" zoning code) is far more complex than this and touched every other citywide zoning change for the past ten years; that Group Living is the issue that would light a fire under Chapter 59 doesn't make a lot of sense"

861,175643330,Carolyn Haas,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,1 Feb,If this amendment and it‚Äôs effect were so well addressed that why did a citizen have to go through the courts to get 48 public documents about this amendment? Just saying this mayor and the city Council don‚Äôt always have your best interest in mind. My personal opinion.
862,175643330,KR C.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,1 Feb,Thank you and agreed.  They don‚Äôt have the public‚Äôs best interest in mind on this one.  They did go through the courts and documents and information was hidden from the public. Check safeandsounddenver.com
863,175643330,Matt C.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,14w,"There are essentially two major concerns of the opposition. Fear of other people, and a desire to maintain property values.

865,175643330,Teresa G.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,1 Feb,"I am most grateful to the extensive research conducted, and advocacy offered, by members of the Safe and Sound group, as well as to members of various RNOs, a few Denver City Council members, thousands of Denver residents, and other stakeholders for expressing opposition to the original Group Living text amendments. Without the research, advocacy, and voiced opposition, the Group Living text amendments would not have undergone revisions in December 2020 that make them a bit more reasonable in their current form. Regardless of how one perceives the tone of the Safe and Sound site, and regardless of how one considers the Group Living text amendments in their current and revised form, the long-term  effects of the proposed text amendments remain to be seen on the increase of housing availability while decreasing housing costs, decreasing gentrification, minimizing neighborhood density, and creating equity in the availability of resources across all parts of the City and County of Denver."

876,175643330,Michelle B.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,2 Feb,"Honest question for those that know: It occurred to me that our wealthiest neighborhoods probably aren't at any risk of being over-run by group homes as the cost to rent these homes would still be astronomical given the amount that would have to be paid.  I also find it hard to believe that a proprietor of group-living homes would look there first for the same reason.  Those homes are just too expensive to reasonably locate a group-home/transitional home in them.  Has this proven true in the cities that have enacted this type of rule?  So, really, this falls to the middle class and poorer neighborhoods to absorb this .... as they do for everything else.  In principal, I'm in favor of this.  Allowing 4 unrelated adults to split a 3 or 4 bedroom home makes so much sense in this housing market. And, if they can afford it - who are we to say they can't?  But, I'm not a fan of pushing this through without addressing the Chapter 59 issue (it defies any attempt to be equitable).  That makes the whole thing sketchy in my opinion."

This Amendment was cooked up by the Mayor, two at-large councilpersons, and providers of services. The hidden objectives were 1) increase community corrections, 2) increase homeless shelters, 3) increase density in single family neighborhoods because of the City's failed efforts with community corrections-homeless shelters-affordable housing. This is a direct transfer of those failures to hard-working, tax-paying, stable Denverites."

885,175643330,Paige Burkeholder,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park East,2 Feb,Impressive!

887,176589826,Tim D.,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,11 Feb,Did Council really exempt their own neighborhoods? I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised but it sounds impossible to believe
888,176589826,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,11 Feb,Yes. There's a special exemption for about 25% of Denver's neighborhoods.
889,176589826,Robin Wells,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,11 Feb,Do you happen to have a link to the newsletter? I‚Äôd be interested in reading it myselfüòä
890,176589826,Dedric Friedly,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,11 Feb,"Not sure, is this it??"
891,176589826,Robin Wells,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,11 Feb,Dedric Friedly Thanks!
892,176589826,Fran Lazarus,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,11 Feb,No neighborhood should be exempt. (Except for council members and the mayor). Haha üò¢
893,176589826,Joan Baronberg,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,11 Feb,"Robin, Did you vote for him? If so, you probably have read his bio (I think the one I am citing was probably written by him). My guess is that he represents His own view of neighborhoods and Life and is less interested in ours. I did not receive his newsletter. Because of his personal history, he may be on a rather one-sided pilgrimage. https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-city-council/council-members/district-10.html"
894,176589826,Robin Wells,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,11 Feb,"Ummm, that started with a loaded question that I won‚Äôt answer....all I said is that I‚Äôd be interested in reading this. That tends to be clearer info than a recap. Who I vote for is no one‚Äôs business but my own. Your vote is also your own business ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
895,176589826,Dawn Martinez,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,11 Feb,Joan what about Chris's personal history tells you he represents his own view and not yours; just curious how you came to this conclusion?
896,176589826,Jeff Hopfenbeck,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Feb,Almost none of District 10 is Chapter 59 (or HOA-controlled). Meaning Chris Hinds' neighborhood is almost certainly not exempt.
897,176589826,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,12w,the letters received in support at the last minute weren't even Denver residents but they counted then anyway.(edited)
898,176589826,Andrew Ross,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,11 Feb,"The goal of representative democracy is not for elected officials to rubber-stamp the will of their constituents. If it were, we would have direct plebiscites.  The founders were quite clear on this.  Your beef is not with Chris Hinds, but James Madison (See federalist #10.)"
899,176589826,Sharyn Dreyer,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,11 Feb,Thank you to Chris Hinds for his vote.  Plenty of his constituents & Denverites in general support his position.  
900,176589826,Max Boyle,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Feb,Sara Henry I think it's you. You're the problem. LOL
901,176589826,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,11 Feb,where is this 80% number coming from?
902,176589826,Max Boyle,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Feb,*motions to thin air*
903,176589826,Bryan Blakely,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,11 Feb,Sara Henry your post misrepresents the facts and damages public trust in elected government. I hope others will inform themselves as to what actually happened.
904,176589826,Joan Baronberg,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,11 Feb,"Bryan, In what way does the post to which you refer ""misrepresent the facts""? Please post that; otherwise you are just slandering someone. Also, why cannot we all find some common ground in that no bias is needed if we see that we want our residential areas to provide cleanliness, quiet, calm. If you want excitement and noise, that is a whole new thing for our neighborhood."
905,176589826,CK Faulkner,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Feb,"sign me up for the recall! also, how were they able to exempt their neighborhoods from the increased housing limits? does anyone have the link?"
906,176589826,Max Boyle,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Feb,They didn't. But the internet allows for misinformation amongst the communication of true information.
907,176589826,Hubert Farbes,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,11 Feb,"I certainly intend to do my own research on this amendment, but does it actually exempt the neighborhoods of city Council person‚Äòs?"
908,176589826,Amanda Russcol,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,11 Feb,Sounds like that's not accurate.
909,176589826,dick/barbara hopper,‚Ä¢ Country Club,11 Feb,"Max Boyle ---- Really?

910,176589826,Max Boyle,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Feb,No you don't wish that so stop it.
911,176589826,Sandi Heller,‚Ä¢ Hale,12w,"Sara, let‚Äôs give it a little time. It‚Äôs unlikely the very worst thing imaginable is going to happen tomorrow. I live down the street from the Mental Health Center of Denver, a location that serves people you might be wary of, and have not seen nor heard any issues regarding tussles among neighbors and clients. Perhaps if we behaved more like a community that takes care of all our residents, we wouldn‚Äôt have so much anxiety when these issues arise.(edited)"
912,176589826,Aleta Sefic,‚Ä¢ Country Club,11 Feb,Thank you Chris Hinds for your vote.  Denver (at least a percentage of us) appreciates all you do in moving our great city forward.
913,176589826,Amy Duclos,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,12w,"Another District 10 RNO board member and I tallied the first four public comment records a few months ago.  Our findings were similar to the ""80% opposed"" that I believe Safe and Sound Denver has been quoting.(edited)"
914,176589826,Bryan Blakely,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,11 Feb,Hi Amy - That would be 80% of those who 1) attended the meetings and 2) submitted public comment. Not of constituents. And 3) it‚Äôs not of the final amendment language. So it‚Äôs not accurate to tout this number
915,176589826,Carol Becht,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Feb,Anyone who listened to Chris Hinds speak before his election would understand he wants high density. His vote should not at all be a surprise to anybody. I hope it doesn‚Äôt lead to all the potential problems discussed but not hopeful given this city continues to seem to go downhill.
916,176589826,Nancy Hodges,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Feb,Let‚Äôs let him know how we feel. And he won‚Äôt get a vote from me in the future. He‚Äôs a follower not a leader.
917,176589826,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,11 Feb,"From his newsletter: ""This survey resulted in about 1000 responses, the vast majority of which were from District 10.  On its face, a narrow majority agreed or strongly agreed with this amendment.  However, the comments showed that some of those against were opposed because this amendment, in their opinion, didn‚Äôt go far enough. """
918,176589826,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Feb,And the 2 at-large council members. None deserve to be reelected. I think one is term limited and will be running for mayor.

923,176589826,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Feb,"I didn't mean you are not black, you are not special if you don't see yourself that way. I'm sorry for that."
924,176589826,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,11 Feb,"Regina Jackson, we are neighbors in CCN. I don't know you but I respect your right to have a different perspective than many of your neighbors.  Serious question... Why can't you do the same? I've seen other ND posts from you with lots of name calling and personal attacks while you demand respect. Isn't respect a two way street? Why don't you set forth your position on the zoning amendment and argue the merits of supporting Hinds rather than spout every current social media woke derogatory term in the book at those with whom you disagree?"
925,176589826,Regina Jackson,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,11 Feb,I have a different perspective because I am a Black woman born and raised in America

I think she showed alot of compassion by actually talking to him through her window, giving him her blanket and then she asked what he needed when he came back.  She showed compassion that hopefully can be repeated by others who read this post. There was no ""calling out a person with dementia"" or cruelty here - at least not  from my perspective.  If anything it was a reminder about how so many are struggling and how we might be able to offer a little act of kindness at times.  Spread love."

1016,172685416,Deb Miller,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,4 Jan,Meant foul smelling circumstances.  I cannot do comedy like you.
1017,172685416,Doug Naiman,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,4 Jan,"I had a very funny professor who had a similar problem. A large dog had been pooping in his yard, and the owner had not been picking it up. So the professor started saving the poop in a plastic garbage bag. He staked out the neighborhood, found the culprit and followed him to find out where he lived. He then went back and retrieved the poop, went to the driveway of the offender, and placed a pile under each of the rear tires/wheels of his car. When driving off, the poop not only got smeared into the driveway, but got splattered into the wheel wells of the vehicle. The pooping stopped shortly thereafter."
1018,172685416,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Jan,YAY Professor!!
1019,172685416,Deb Miller,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,4 Jan,That's also a very Patient professor!  I can't decide if I'm laughing at the professor with unfailing good humor or the visualization of the dog owner being shocked as that stuff under his wheels
1020,172685416,Lisa Colletti,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 Jan,Hee hee - absolutely love Princess Bride references. I leave love notes right on the masterpiece. I was picking up poops but that was only making it worse.
1021,172685416,Patrick Kincaid,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,5 Jan,I hope you didn't measure it. üò±
1022,172685416,Roger Adams,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills/Holly Ridge,5 Jan,Solution: a nice sign next to a plastic bag dispenser?  At least you said it in a creative way ....
1023,172685416,Pamela Porter,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 Jan,I saw a woman walking a camel üê™ last week.  Could it be them?
1024,172685416,Gregory Clark,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,5 Jan,Now it all makes sense.
1025,172685416,Kelly Dwyer,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,6 Jan,"I am cracking up about POUS. This is not my dog, though he does have POUS, POUC (color) and POUT (texture). Picking up after him is quite challenging w/o going into the gory details. But I indeed do it. Sorry for your personal POUS dilemma and thanks for a fun post amid the covid and crime threads."
1026,175070602,Chris Platt,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,27 Jan,This whole situation is a complete disaster.
1027,175070602,Sierra Raposa,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NW,14w,"What confuses me is, for the camps near me, they have already been posting signs and sending cops around to tell people 7-10 days in advance of cleanups. Maybe there have been cases where emergency cleanups are necessary? Idk, they never pop up out of the blue.. always a slow build, from what I've seen.(edited)"
1028,175070602,KC Beck,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,27 Jan,Clean ups don't solve the problem.
1029,175070602,Chris Platt,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,27 Jan,"Nope, but they ensure that no one neighborhood has to single-handedly deal with the problem."
1030,174671542,Norah Lovato,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14w,Dispose of them.  Just do it!  üòÄUsed pillows are kinda like used underwear.  Ya know. Hard to unload.  Good luck.(edited)
1031,174671542,Jennifer Mayes,‚Ä¢ Hale,23 Jan,"I use pillow cases lol. Considering guests have used them when they stay in the guestroom, I‚Äôm going to have to disagree with you on that one. Just hoping to find something to do with them other than the landfill. Especially if there are people sleeping outside in the cold without one"
1032,174671542,Betsy Wolcott,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,23 Jan,"I wonder if the homeless shelters, who were collecting bedding and needed mattresses would be interested.  Sorry I don't have any more specific information.  It would nice if you could wash them before passing them on."
1033,174671542,Jennifer Mayes,‚Ä¢ Hale,23 Jan,That‚Äôs what I was wondering. I know there are people on the site that collect items to give to homeless people directly as well.
1034,174671542,Camille Lott,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,24 Jan,"You can always try animal shelters. Normally they are happy to take old sheets, blankets and towels so I‚Äôm sure pillows might work"
1035,174671542,Jennifer Mayes,‚Ä¢ Hale,24 Jan,Great idea!
1036,174671542,Brenda Mokrohisky,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Jan,The Denver Rescue Mission Warehouse will take them. They are washed and reused.
1037,174671542,Nancy Tucker,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,24 Jan,Call the African Community Center....they might and I believe they pick up.   They set up newly arrived immigrants in their homes.
1038,174671542,Stephanie Subramanian,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,24 Jan,Animal shelters generally don't take pillows
1039,174671542,Reana Vensor,‚Ä¢ City Park,28 Jan,Animal shelters!! They take blankets as well.
1040,174671542,Kerry Merrell,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,30 Jan,Other than animal shelters. No one will accept used pillows. They have to be new and in the plastic due to sanitary issues
1041,172857756,Joyce Cerretti,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,6 Jan,No surprise here.
1042,172857756,Megan Dubee,‚Ä¢ City Park West,6 Jan,"Thanks for sharing, I‚Äôm experiencing this in my neighborhood.  Hopefully both cities can work together to tackle this."
1043,172642550,Lynn Alcon,‚Ä¢ Westwood,3 Jan,My friend Janet Matzen she feeds the homeless every Sunday morning downtown 16 street mall 9:30-11 no matter the weather  they will be there.   She also on Facebook tou can message her  she great actavist.
1044,172642550,Matthew Conn,‚Ä¢ Berkeley-Regis,3 Jan,I can  show  you.  I moved here homeless  a year ago
1045,172797351,Randy Dust,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Jan,How weird that she would return to the same spot again!
1046,172797351,Lynn Stubbart,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 Jan,Anyone check the back?  Traffickers?  Just thinking out loud...
1047,172797351,Lisa Cherry,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Jan,There is a lock on the back
1048,172797351,Richard Caldwell,‚Ä¢ Central Park,5 Jan,Homeless camping?  I have seen some other vehicles around CP parked for weeks
1049,172797351,Kelly Petersen,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,18w,"What I feel is very strange about the situation somebody with a warrant is not going to bail out of jail in 30 minutes there's a reason for the warrant that needs to be squished before they let people go as far as my education tells me. And the cops dropped her off, very unusual maybe she's a confidential informant possibly keeping an eye on somebody in your neighborhood that could potentially be a bigger worry.(edited)"
1050,172797351,Kelly Petersen,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,18w,"Other than that she's probably just homeless lives in her truck and doesn't have a better part of town to park at the moment, or possibly out of fuel those big box trucks guzzle gasoline. I would think people that are thieves or criminals would not stay in one spot where they can be seen by the same people over and over again. Hard telling not knowing, though I have to agree with you, after the cops it is a rather odd situation.(edited)"
1051,172797351,Anjel s.,‚Ä¢ Hale,5 Jan,The beginning of California? people living on vehicles.
1052,172797351,Jennifer W.,‚Ä¢ Central Park,5 Jan,We have someone parking in front of our house every afternoon through the following morning in Northfield. He keeps his car on all night.
1053,172797351,Mark Groves,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17w,"That same truck was parked in front of my house over Christmas, just after the incident in Tennessee. I notified 311 and I  watched police make contact with them. There are 2 people, one of them likes to yell out loud from time to time. "
1054,172797351,Lisa Cherry,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Jan,"Thank you for sharing this information. It is slightly comforting to know that we aren‚Äôt alone. The woman yells often, using profanity and aggression. She seems very unstable. The police also informed us about the 72 hour rule, which leaves me feeling powerless over the situation, as they move every two days."
1055,172797351,Karla Alva,‚Ä¢ Hale,5 Jan,I feel your frustration and I also feel bad for her. If I were you I would march right up to that passenger door and insist she tell me what the hell was going on with her üòÖ
1056,172797351,Karla Alva,‚Ä¢ Hale,5 Jan,"...On her hands, Literally. I had to pull this photo from google photos - but this is what the hands of a meth addict will look like. I know of this because I have a close family member with a meth addiction. They too hang out in their car for hours and hours and even live out of it sometimes months on end. Unfortunately it‚Äôs the life many drug addicts like and choose over sobriety and a warm home. Best of luck to you guys with this situation üôè‚ú®"
1057,172797351,Lisa Cherry,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Jan,Thank you for the information. I appreciate you taking the time to share your perspective.
1058,172797351,Karla Alva,‚Ä¢ Hale,5 Jan,In the meantime- I would go out and get a wind chime and/or a multi faceted crystal that you can hang in their general direction to block the negative chi you are experiencing coming from their direction. I would hang the wind chimes or bells from the cable dish or anywhere outside the sound won‚Äôt be obstructed- and far enough from your bedroom windows. Then I would hang the crystal in the window on the inside of  home. Simple Feng Shui at your service!
1059,172797351,Chad A.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Jan,Since you are the one who called the cops can‚Äôt you call them and ask what they did or are doing about the warrant? And why they let her stay there? Just curious
1060,172797351,Lisa Cherry,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 Jan,"I called back and the information they provided was that they investigated the situation, she wasn‚Äôt a threat, and that I could not take further action until they were outside for more than 72 hours"

1062,172797351,Julie Lovell,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 Jan,Hard times for many folks and people are forced to live in their vehicles. Be kind but cautious. Could easily be any of us.
1063,172797351,Aldo Covarrubias,‚Ä¢ Clayton,7 Jan,"that may be her home and she may be mentally ill, and maybe addicted to a substance to numb the pain of existing. Not everyone has the same luck as those who have a ""normal life""."
1064,172797351,Gretchen Koehler,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,17w,"That is kind of obvious.  It doesn't mean that we have to accept homeless people who ""may be mentally ill"" possibly leaving needles, excrement or bothering people who live in a nice neighborhood.  Seriously,  what if the issue becomes so great that we have homeless people living in cars up and down neighborhood blocks.  Are you going to say we should just accept it because poor them?  I have helped the homeless on many occasions.  Believe me some of them want help.  Many do not.  They understand how to live on the streets and they are truly comfortable with the lifestyle.   The drug addicts just want their next ""fix"" and will do whatever it takes to get it.  Lisa good luck in helping the woman move along.  For any of you that are concerned about the woman's welfare, don't insult Lisa by patronizing her.  Here's an idea, go find the box truck and offer her a ride to the methadone clinic or to get registered with Denver Health and Human Services.  There is a place right on Colfax just east of Colorado on the Northside of the street that you can take her to get some help.(edited)"
1065,186175349,Sherry Johnson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,3 days ago,We got one 2 weeks ago at King Soopers at Leetsdale/Monaco.

1071,186175349,Meghan Berglind,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,1 day ago,Nobody physically refills them that I know of. They sell the tanks. Your first one is more expensive. After that you bring it back and get an ‚Äúexchange‚Äù‚Äîa new cylinder‚Äî that is about 1/2 as much because you returned your old cylinder.
1072,186175349,Jim Gordon,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,1 day ago,Meghan Berglind FYI Ace refills tanks

1074,186175349,Jim Gordon,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,1 day ago,Cynch.com is a site operated by Amerigas that delivers propane directly to your home. They offer switch-out refill service where they replace your empty tank with a full one as well as single tank and propane delivery which is what you are looking for. Says the cost for delivering a tank and propane is around $50. I just used them for a refill the other day and it was only 10 bucks.

1114,176869450,Stephanie Bean,‚Ä¢ City Park,13 Feb,"I have these, 2 are half full and 1 is full. Would they work with what he has? I‚Äôll put it on my porch, PM me for address... I can‚Äôt take them to him."
1115,176869450,Aleta Johnson,‚Ä¢ Whittier,14 Feb,It‚Äôs so cold out! I have hand and foot warmers. I also have a propane heater he could use if he wants to have two. I also have one of those mini rocket stoves that burns on Thermo fuel that he could use to heat up soup or drinks. Let me know if you think any of this would help.
1116,176869450,Rebecca Matthys,‚Ä¢ City Park,14 Feb,"I gave him foot warmers, but I‚Äôm sure he would appreciate the other things.  Are you able to drop them off to him?"

1118,176869450,Aleta Johnson,‚Ä¢ Whittier,14 Feb,"I tried out the extra heater, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be working, maybe because my propane expired in 2018.

1128,176869450,Cynthia Vaida,‚Ä¢ City Park,14 Feb,"When you have visited this person, did he tell you why his wheelchair is 8 feet away from his tent? Why haven't social services been called to visit him? did he refuse to go to a shelter? Very very sad and depressing. Anyone have any back story on why he is in this terrible situation. Oh, I see a previous posting that he has identified himself. Greg?"
1129,176869450,Tricia Linley,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Feb,Greg has a friend with him that has a ‚Äúbad leg‚Äù and it is his wheelchair.  They were forced to move across the street late Friday and just dragged what they could with them.
1130,176869450,Rebecca Matthys,‚Ä¢ City Park,14 Feb,Cynthia.  I‚Äôm not sure that wheel chair is for his own use.   He was outside his tent and mobile when I first met him.
1131,176869450,Goose Sorensen,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Feb,"Just took him hot soup and tea and some fruit power bars and water.,"
1132,176869450,Lina Krueck,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14 Feb,this thread warms my heart. will try to bring him some things tomorrow! anything specific he might need other than propane?
1133,176869450,Tricia Linley,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Feb,"I‚Äôm afraid the park will make him move soon, so earlier is probably better tomorrow.  I think anything that might help with warmth is most important."
1134,176869450,Ashley Howlett,‚Ä¢ Skyland,14 Feb,Can we get him a hotel?! That is awful!  A propane stove isn‚Äôt going to help in this kind of weather.
1135,176869450,Kammy Alford,‚Ä¢ City Park West,14 Feb,"It's kind of late, but if you can find a place and he is willing to go, I will chip in."
1136,176869450,Jami Horwitz,‚Ä¢ Whittier,14 Feb,I am heartened by the kindness I am seeing on this thread.  There are some very malicious people who live in this area who do nothing but spew venom about the homeless and insist that they are ALL criminals and drug addicts.
1137,176869450,Ashley Howlett,‚Ä¢ Skyland,12w,"It doesn‚Äôt matter if they are criminals OR drug addicts. Everyone deserves love and compassion. It is really the only thing that can change the world. That being said, I‚Äôm not going to allow a stranger in my house for my own safety. Compassion with healthy boundaries.(edited)"
1138,176869450,Cynthia Vaida,‚Ä¢ City Park,15 Feb,Thanks for letting us all know. How are they both doing? Are they actually in the tent? The wheelchair is still sitting there. Didn't Greg's friend need it in order to move?
1139,176869450,Tricia Linley,‚Ä¢ City Park,15 Feb,"They‚Äôve been in the tent every time I‚Äôve stopped by.  His friend can stand, but I think needs the wheelchair for walking longer distances?"
1140,174926202,Kirsten Barnard,‚Ä¢ Hale,25 Jan,"Wow, they are not going to ever be able to claim its theirs. There truly is no other camper like it.  It‚Äôs beautiful.  I‚Äôm so sorry.  I‚Äôll keep my eyes open.  Seems like you might be a candidate to get on the news as your camper is so unique.  It seems there may be a story behind it.  You might email pics to local newsrooms.  Reporters might see it."
1141,174926202,Magnus Olsen,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,25 Jan,so sorry. Terrible (and getting worse). I hope it is recovered.
1142,174926202,Simon Lofts,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,25 Jan,What does it look like outside ?
1143,174926202,Genevieve Kathleen,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,"I added pictures of the outside, not sure why they didn't upload before. Its a small teardrop trailer"

1145,174926202,Kurt Schoffstall,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,"Hope you find it. Best of luck! If I see it, I‚Äôll make sure it gets back to you"
1146,174926202,Genevieve Kathleen,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,Thank you. I'm really sad about it
1147,174926202,Alison Kenda,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,"I swear I saw this camper on cherry creek drive between Holly and Monaco last night, parked on the South side of the road next to the river. It really struck me because of the tree window and I remember thinking 'is that made of wood?!' You didn't say when it was stolen, but I saw it around 5 to 5:15 pm last night."
1148,174926202,Lynn Laing,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,26 Jan,You are a rock star!!
1149,174926202,Elizabeth Weiss,‚Ä¢ City Park,26 Jan,I am so so sorry this has happened. I will keep my eyes out. Do you have full coverage on it?
1150,174926202,Georgianna Forbes,‚Ä¢ Country Club,26 Jan,Can you post more pics of outside?  Don‚Äôt worry I bet you get back since it will be hard to hide. The News is a great idea - send your story in so they will help spread the word.
1151,174926202,Genevieve Kathleen,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,I did now. Thanks for the heads up
1152,174926202,Christine Hoff,‚Ä¢ City Park West,26 Jan,"i had my camper broken into, rummaged, and possibly slept in.  but not stolen. so sorry to read this.  having your things stolen really does leave you with the worst, pit in stomach, feeling."

1154,174926202,Paul Reynolds,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,"Yes, agree w Carol to take a drive to Cherry Creek and the park there, per Alison's tip. Do try to get a plate number and photos if attached to a vehicle, of course. Will be watching. Absolutely beautiful camper. Am so sorry folks think this is acceptable."

1157,174926202,Genevieve Kathleen,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,I had a hitch and a wheel lock on it.
1158,174926202,Ryan Starbuck,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,Ugh! That sucks. I'm so sorry
1159,174926202,Laura Ellerby,‚Ä¢ City Park West,26 Jan,"This is terrible! What is going on in Congress Park? Every day, there is report after report about bicycle, truck, car thefts. Genevieve‚Äôs camper is a veritable work of art‚Äîsomething to be cherished as well as used. I hope the low-lifes who stole it do not attempt to disguise it by painting it. "
1160,174926202,Kaylee Browning,‚Ä¢ City Park West,26 Jan,The problem is not low life‚Äôs. The problem is an economy that does not support the bottom quartile of the population.
1161,174926202,Genevieve Kathleen,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,Thank you everyone for keeping a lookout. I've found the trailer and denver Police department is here.
1162,174926202,Ryan Starbuck,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,So happy to hear! I hope it's okay and has not been rummaged through. It's such a personal item and I can't imagine what you're dealing with
1163,174926202,Kaylee Browning,‚Ä¢ City Park West,26 Jan,"Sweet, they find a stolen purple specialized bike by chance?"
1164,174926202,Genevieve Kathleen,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,They had the nerve to try and sell it
1165,174926202,Sophie Sokolowski,‚Ä¢ North Capitol Hill,26 Jan,I saw this on the street too!
1166,174926202,Robin Wells,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,26 Jan,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èYay! Not the brightest thieves luckily....leaving it on the street near where they stole it. May all thieves be so stupid üôèüèª
1167,174926202,Kirk Wayland,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,26 Jan,That is one cool camper! It's like a mobile Hobbit hole! Did they catch the thieves?
1168,174926202,Genevieve Kathleen,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,I'm hoping so. Waiting now while the police investigate
1169,174926202,Dawn Barnhart,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,26 Jan,Great to hear it's been found so quickly. Hopefully your gear is still inside.

1189,173328530,Laurie Saltzman,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,10 Jan,"Barb, are towels ever needed?"
1190,173328530,Barbara McMahon,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Jan,"Yes, hand towels are best as most have limited space in their backpacks or duffel bags."
1191,173328530,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,10 Jan,"I am proud of you, Barb.  That was quite a haul.  My colleague and I are Resurrection Clothing.  As such we go directly to the homeless camps with clothing, toiletries, shoes, blankets/sleeping bags, backpacks, pants, tops, and lots of jackets and coats thanks to the generosity of this community.    If Barb doesn't need the towels, we would like them, but of course she gets first dibs."
1192,173328530,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,10 Jan,Somehow my name shows up as Nancy A.  I am really Laura Avant.
1193,173328530,Belinda Haley,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,11 Jan,How do I get in contact am in need of these items my 720 365 4710  ask for Thanks

1195,173328530,Barbara McMahon,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Jan,"Send me a PM Belinda w list of what you need. Best, Barb"
1196,173328530,Jen Egan-Fowler,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Jan,"Hi Barbara, how often are you dropping food/items and where? We'd like to help at least with some clothes, etc."
1197,173328530,Barbara McMahon,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Jan,"Hi Jen, our next distribution will be Saturday Feb 20th. This past Saturday we started at the Open Door Fellowship, but distributed the majority of food and clothing in the parking lot at Park Ave West and Stout St. If you are familiar with that area there are currently a good number of tents and makeshift dwellings on the block. It‚Äôs risky business for these folks to leave their tents and belongings, so we go to them. Anything you‚Äôd like to donate can be left on my porch. Thanks so much for reaching out, Barb"
1198,173328530,Joyce Brown,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,11 Jan,"Master of headlines, indeed!  Recognized the list of items from my contributions list and felt sick that all had been‚Äôstolen‚Äô...SO thankful all went to those who need!  Great work!"
1199,173328530,Chris Watson,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Jan,I just came upon this.  Would like to know more.
1200,173328530,Barbara McMahon,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Jan,"Chris, our grassroots coalition of kindness consists of myself and a handful of Nextdoor neighbors distributing donated food, ,clothing, toiletries, backpacks etc. to those in need. All are welcome to join, our next run will be  Saturday,Feb 20th  Let me know if you are interested in joining us or would like to collect any of the aforementioned items in your neighborhood or workplace. Best, Barb"
1201,173328530,Carol Martin,‚Ä¢ City Park West,11 Jan,Stopped by with a drop several days ago..porch was PACKED!!! Thanks so much for your efforts!

1206,173328530,Lindsey C.,‚Ä¢ North Capitol Hill,12 Jan,I had the same thought! Such a happier post than I expected.
1207,172184834,Carol Neal,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,29 Dec,Terrible!
1208,172184834,Caroline Smith,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill Central,29 Dec,Where is this please?
1209,172184834,Michael Miller,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec,500 block of Fillmore.
1210,172184834,Stacy Oh,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,11 Jan,It took 2+ years to build the monstrosity across the street from me in the 400 block of Fillmore.  2 cute bungalows scraped to build a 3-story beautiful but inappropriate for the neighborhood. I no longer have views of the sunset.
1211,172184834,Terri Vitale,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,29 Dec,That‚Äôs just ridiculous
1212,172184834,Jeremy Lawton,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,29 Dec,I thought nothing could beat the monstroscopy on 6th and St. Paul but here it is
1213,172184834,Sam Wrl,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,30 Dec,Call 311 and report the address to be inspected for zoning and setback
1214,172184834,Anita M.,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,31 Dec,Another  311 option
1215,172184834,John Morris,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,30 Dec,That‚Äôs what we said 30 years ago about CCN. Progress
1216,172184834,Susan Sprague,‚Ä¢ City Park West,31 Dec,"Yup, moved to CC in 1995 and don't go near the area if I can avoid it now.  This wonderful neighborhood has been destroyed by developers allowed to do whatever they pleased and all the small, wonderful shops and businesses have disappeared.  Will never, ever spend my time or money there--MONSTROSITIES and chains have taken over--UGHHHHH!!!"
1217,172184834,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,30 Dec,"And if everyone doesn't write to their City Councilperson those monstrosities will be allowed to have 10 adults, unlimited children and unlimited cars living next to you. Andrew Webb and Co at the city plan to change zoning to almost no limits, including that home also being a homeless shelter or a correctional facility ""because we need to make every neighborhood equitable""."

1219,172184834,Andrea Szporn,‚Ä¢ City Park,30 Dec,Awful
1220,172184834,Joseph Sobin,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,30 Dec,"The zoning changed from R-2 to G-RH-3 many years ago, probably over a decade. However it is not necessarily the zoning to blame. G-RH-3 is a multi unit district allowing urban house, duplex, and row house building forms. "
1221,172184834,Katie Kelly,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,31 Dec,Cyndi Kemper I believe it‚Äôs right behind the apothecary. Saw it on my way to work this afternoon. Total eyesore.
1222,172184834,John Albers,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,30 Dec,"This lot appears to be zoned G-RH-3, just like he majority of the CCN residential area. That zoning requires 20 ft setback in the front and 5 foot setbacks on both sides. It also permits heights up to 30 feet. Joseph Sobin is correct - if the setbacks or height "
1223,172184834,Michael Miller,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,31 Dec,"This look like 20"" setback to you? 5' on each side?"
1224,172184834,Marc Spear,‚Ä¢ Country Club,18w,"Mayor Hancock has been extremely developer-friendly. Denver City Council lost the remaining resistance in the last City election. Many on Council argue ""great density will lead to better affordability."" There are no (zero) examples in the entire US that they cite where ""upzoning"" (allowing more units, greater heights, more people) has created affordability. They are either fooled or corrupt. They have used this period during which the city has banned large gatherings, including neighborhood meetings, to pass massive, unprecedented changes to zoning, such as the East Central Area Plan (which was designed in backrooms for over one year before the first public meeting) and East Area Plan, and soon the Group Living Amendment which combines unrelated issues. These changes, the early parts of the City's Neighborhood Planning Initiative, will bulldozed what the city's own planners call ""naturally-occurring affordable housing"" for the latest and greatest in marbles and hardwoods, all premised on the future residents choosing to use the City's subway (non-existent, not planned) to get to their jobs downtown (also non-existent). They are recreating the Denver of 1985 for 2025.(edited)"

Can‚Äôt deal with a city that doesn‚Äôt quite know how to respect its tax paying constituents while turning a blind eye to crime & homelessness. A one party system will destroy. Only takes one generation. I hail from Chicago...they have decimated our city with the bureaucracy(edited)"
1231,172184834,Emily May,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,18w,Time for some new blood in our local government.   Over-developing our city needs to be monitored.   We have entered times where politicians at every level are profiteering at our expense.   How did we arrive at this new deal anyway?  It happened while we were ‚Äòsleeping‚Äô.(edited)
1232,172184834,Tanner Johnson,‚Ä¢ Cory - Merrill,17w,"Actually, the city council is extremely anti development and anti developer. Regulations that require developers to build affordable or pay into a fund make building new market rate housing more expensive. The city has created a long process to get any new project out of the ground. As an example, the city requires developers to build new curb and gutter in cases where the city did a poor job of the original instillation, and it doesn't have to be new construction. The process to get a plan approved is about 6 months. 6 months of carrying costs, additional expenses for ""off site"" work, pay into the affordable fund. Now the only way to build is if you can sell it for $1mil +.(edited)"
1233,172184834,Edgar Neel,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,31 Dec,"It happened because of the people we elected; Jamie Gillies would have been a good replacement for Hancock, but too few people were paying attention."

1235,172184834,Laurie Jensen,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,31 Dec,Thank the city council and the mayor for being in the developers pockets for that.
1236,172184834,Tanner Johnson,‚Ä¢ Cory - Merrill,9 Jan,"Please attend a city council meeting and see for yourself if the council people are in the developers pockets. It will help you understand just how much requirement and scrutiny the city puts on developers. Better yet, speak with a developer about why they think it's nearly impossible to build new housing in Denver for middle class families. If it was possible you'd see a lot more of it."
1237,172184834,Dustin Adkins,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,31 Dec,"Nearly every entity at the local level is bent on packing in as many people as possible here, while encouraging the highest possible rent, all without regard for the diminishing quality of life here in Denver. It‚Äôs tiresome for those of us who care about truly affordable housing and who also care about the character of our city. There‚Äôs lots of lip service to both from community leaders but little action in the right direction for either. Just my opinion as a 20 year resident."

It is demoralizing for anyone, especially teens, to feel dirty and have to wear dirty clothes.  How wonderful it would be if the schools provided washers and dryers and a small shower stall to help these kids who are poor and/or homeless through absolutely no fault of their own.  This show of caring might help to keep students on the edge in school."

I dislike feeling it necessary to share suspicious activity like this, but I dislike hearing neighbors being victims of crime even more. (And, it's downright terrifying to have a strange man peering in your window.) These are tough times for everyone and more than tough for many. Folks are desperate, yet there are resources for accessing help, too, for those who seek it. Crime is not the answer to solving one's problems.(edited)"

Single men are lowest priority.  I had five people beg for the tent donated.  Some just standing under an awning with a few belongings, underdressed.  The man sharing the tent with a family is still there!  If anyone else has a tent to donate & help someone through rough times, I know they would appreciate it.  I can pick up locally and drive them over.(edited)"
1285,173241107,Naila Iversen,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Jan,I have a brand new tent to offer if u still need please let me know.
1286,173241107,Kathleen Delaney,‚Ä¢ Hudson Street,11 Jan,I urge all of you to help these homeless communities through existing agencies.  Not sure if anyone caught the channel 4 series on the mayor of Aurora spending a week in the streets after Christmas.  For the safety of all these people in the community.  Let‚Äôs help them all get permanent housing through trained professionals.  If we all continue to enable the individuals never get the much needed help available to them.
1287,173241107,Marisa Baldwin,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,11 Jan,"I understand your concern but if the pros were so good, there would be less, not more homeless.  Grassroots assistance can be a game changer."

I'm happy to come by and pick up items (just PM me) or they can be dropped off at Barb's house, 1212 Garfield Street in CP.  As she says, accepting donations indefinitely...tough times for a lot of people right now."

1294,170422058,Jessica Jimmy,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,11 Dec,Yea well I mean she‚Äôs usually at kingsoopers on 13th and Krameria if you‚Äôd like to see what she may need
1295,170422058,Lisa Betchey,‚Ä¢ Lowry,11 Dec,She should call United Way‚Äôs helpline 211.
1296,170422058,Jessica Jimmy,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,11 Dec,That‚Äôs not what I asked for she‚Äôs old and doesn‚Äôt have a phone
1297,170422058,Paola McAllister,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,11 Dec,where was she? I go there all the time and have never seen her. I speak Spanish so that would be helpful
1298,170422058,Jessica Jimmy,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,12 Dec,She said she should be there Monday over by the exit facing aafway
1299,170422058,Nicole Delmoro,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Dec,I saw her earlier this week too and gave her some money but wasn‚Äôt able to speak to her as my Spanish is not ver good. She seemed very sweet and her son looked to be about 4 or 5. I was wondering about her story. Please post what you find out.
1300,170422058,Tom Stevens,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,13 Dec,Which kingsoopers?
1301,170422058,Jessica Jimmy,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Dec,On Krameria and 13th

1303,170422058,Terry Sipes,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Dec,"I hope she is the real deal. By that I mean not a fake homeless person, a real humane in need, sad that she and her son are in that condition."
1304,170422058,Nicole Delmoro,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Dec,Good point. I usually don‚Äôt give money and only offer food but it looked like there was a chance she and the boy really needed it.  If it is a scam that makes me sad too and I hope she does get help. Thank you Jessica Jimmy for following up with her. You are a good person.

1311,168667364,Jennifer D.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Nov,I volunteer to herd the alpacas from 5am-8am every morning.
1312,168667364,Brent Valente,‚Ä¢ Hale,23 Nov,People can‚Äôt even pick up after their dogs...who‚Äôs going to pick up after the alpacas?
1313,168667364,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,24 Nov,Employment for the homeless?
1314,168667364,Connie Jenni,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,23 Nov,"They are wonderful sweet docile creatures. I am afraid of their vulnerability if left to free roaming. They have very specific diets. They need to be treated with the care, intellect and dignity they deserve. I‚Äôm not sure having free roaming alpacas in the middle of the city would be beneficial to the animals. I believe it would be very harmful to them."
1315,168667364,Alli Reibach,‚Ä¢ Hale,23 Nov,"Don‚Äôt worry Connie, we‚Äôre all just being playful. It would be an nightmare to ACTUALLY populate the neighborhood with alpacas, but it‚Äôs a cute idea if you don‚Äôt think about it too hard ü§™"

1339,180617856,Rosalie Munk,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Mar,Huh that‚Äôs an interesting perspective...I read the info differently when presented on this fact sheet https://www.ddfl.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SCS_one-pager-with-partners-3.4.21.pdf
1340,180617856,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,19 Mar,"Rosalie, the issues come from the wording of the bill. "
1341,180617856,Rosalie Munk,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Mar,Ryan Flippo it seemed that those healthy and safe would be adopted out ASAP while those not would be required to be treated/trained/fostered until they were
1342,180617856,Kelly Conner,‚Ä¢ Hale,19 Mar,Hm. I read the bill and am confused as to where in it implies that they are trying to eliminate no-kill shelters or force euthanasia on dogs not deemed ‚Äúhealthy and safe‚Äù it seemed to me like it was trying to add more guidelines and improve the standard of care shelters must offer? Do you have more information as to how you came to this conclusion??
1343,180617856,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,19 Mar,"Let‚Äôs say your dog got out and was picked up by animal control because you didn‚Äôt chip or collar your dog. The dog is 12 years old, deaf, has a slight limp, and scared because they are trying to get home... someone determines that this homeless dog has a poor quality of life so they euthanize the animal because they need to make room for other animals."
1344,180617856,Rosalie Munk,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Mar,Ryan Flippo isn‚Äôt that what is happening now? Why would the bill basically mean...continue what you‚Äôre doing
1345,180617856,Patty Young,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,19 Mar,Many people believe ‚Äúno kill‚Äù shelters should be the only option.  Many of these shelters will not take in animals that have health problems or are injured.  This bill is to aid those shelters willing to do their best for all animals regardless of condition and are compassionate enough to realize that sometimes euthanasia is the last option.
1346,180617856,Joe Can,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,21 Mar,Mark Kaplan your first line of your post shows that you know nothing of the bill and you're just looking to scare your neighbors. Those behind the bill know that the No-Kill movement does more harm than good. Look what happened at the Pueblo animal shelter a couple of years ago when PAWS for life took over. Also it's not the goal of everyone who works at an animal shelter to euthanize healthy adoptable animals it's the goal to find homes for all of them. And any shelter that says they are no-kill but only euthanize for medical or behavioral issues is a kill shelter or what's normally called an Open Admission Shelter
1347,180617856,Ann Burke,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7w,"I have closely watched and studied how all of the rescue / shelter entities worked for 3 years now, and this bill is HEINOUSLY wrong. If you don‚Äôt know what it implies, well... get off your high horse and off your soapbox. It‚Äôs a bill written by 3 extemely well funded CO shelters who rely on poor rescues to do what they easily could, but aren‚Äôt willing to. It‚Äôs the rich shelter telling everyone else they will euthanize carte Blanche, with NO oversight (criticism), and eat cake at that. It‚Äôs a very cleverly worded, evil bill.(edited)"
1348,173030450,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,8 Jan,Everything in this documentary is against the law now so I am not sure what your point is. Anyone can live anywhere. Seems like you are trying to ease some guilt that might best be done in confession or some other personal place.

1350,173030450,Gregory Clark,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,9 Jan,"Sorry, but just because something is against the law, Doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt occur. I think the article was good for awareness of things that not all of us experience."
1351,173030450,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Jan,"I do believe that we should never forget and young people do need to learn what happened in the past lest we repeat it. It is, fortunately, not happening in Denver now."
1352,173030450,Anna Noble,‚Ä¢ Central Park,9 Jan,"I disagree. Segregation is alive and well most everywhere. To assume that people are poor because they just aren‚Äôt working hard, or they made bad choices is the definition of white privilege.

1380,182347092,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,4 Apr,I was at the Target store in Glendale yesterday afternoon. They were giving shots there. They had a table set up right outside the fitting rooms.
1381,182347092,Sandi Pravecek,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,5 Apr,Was it the J&J?
1382,182347092,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Apr,Sandi Pravecek I don‚Äôt know. I didn‚Äôt ask; I just saw that they were set up there.
1383,181673732,Chris Lyn,‚Ä¢ Hale,6w,"Also, a gajillion thanks to all of the humans who supported myself and my coworkers while dealing with these non-mask wearing people (three of whom made comments about how our ‚ÄòNew Jew owner‚Äô doesn‚Äôt respect tradition!!!!), even more gratitude to the ones who patiently waited for our kitchen to get back on track today, and even more thanks to everyone who has supported the restaurant industry during the last year.(edited)"
1384,181673732,Irene Schiavo,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,28 Mar,????? What???? Where is this?
1385,181673732,Mike Stephens,‚Ä¢ City Park,28 Mar,Let people be adults and make there own decisions. Stay home if ur not comfortable with others decisions. Pretty simple
1386,181673732,Jeremy Brown,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,28 Mar,It‚Äôs not clear that vaccinated people can‚Äôt transmit the virus. Wear a mask or stay home. Pretty Simple.
1387,181673732,Mike Stephens,‚Ä¢ City Park,28 Mar,Their oopsie
1388,181673732,Mike Stephens,‚Ä¢ City Park,28 Mar,The racist comments by them are horrible
1389,181673732,Deb Miller,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,28 Mar,"Chris, if I could, I would paste a mask on every face I see.  Hoping you stay well in spite of people who think that making 'adult choices' includes the right to put other people's lives at risk and call it mature behavior.  "
1390,181673732,Joan Huie,‚Ä¢ Hale,7 Apr,It helps to do your own research
1391,181673732,Bob Deline,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,28 Mar,I can‚Äôt believe they wouldn‚Äôt wear a mask upon entering only to take them off while actively eating and drinking in order for you to feel safe. These people should be shunned and no longer allowed to be on airplanes.  So sorry for your struggles.
1392,181673732,Amy Johnson,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,6w,"Nice sarcasm there, Bob. It‚Äôs so people aren‚Äôt crop-dusting their virus through the restaurant on the way to the tables. Good grief, I‚Äôm not sure why caring about other people became such a bad thing to some people.(edited)"
1393,181673732,Mark Ryan,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,28 Mar,"Ill fitting and poorly made masks are the virtual signaling ""do something"" price we have to pay to go out and about.  I don't know why we can't all treat them like Santa Clause and go along with the charade- before they come up with truly harmful things like cell-phone apps to track you  and put you in lock down if you get close to suspected carrier, or vaccine passports to carry around.  Hopefully for a few more months we can all just pretend that they work, and then we can have a huge bonfire, burn them, drink Corona beer and use all the hoarded TP to paper the town, just not near the bonfires."
1394,181673732,Kate Swan,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6w,"It‚Äôs not just virtue signaling.  Masks are imperfect, sure, but they help stop the spread of the virus. Caring about your neighbor and doing your part to follow public health guidance might actually be real virtue ‚Äî too bad it‚Äôs not always the norm and too bad people who are simply doing their best not to add to the problem are denigrated.(edited)"
1395,181673732,Sandra Moore,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,29 Mar,"I‚Äôm sorry Chris.  I have and will continue to comply with CDC orders in order to protect everyone.  I care about you even though I don‚Äôt know you.  I value your life.  We get our second shots this morning so soon we can FINALLY hang out with our fellow vaccinated friends at our house.  We will continue to support our local restaurants by picking up food, leaving a decent tip and bring it home.  And we will continue to have deliveries.  We will do this until we are told by our learned scientists that it is safe to do otherwise.  My husband and I do not want to be part of the problem."
1396,181673732,Mark Ryan,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,29 Mar,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs pedantic to bring up that those are CDC guidelines and not orders.
1397,181673732,Judy Richardson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,29 Mar,"Why am I skeptical that they were even vaccinated?   Based on their racist comments and resistance to protect others they more fit the mould of those who would refuse to be vaccinated.   So sorry you have to deal with this üò©, what sad and crazy times we‚Äôre living in."
1398,181673732,Patty Blevins,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,29 Mar,Wearing is caringüò∑üò∑üò∑
1399,181673732,Barb Leon,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,29 Mar,"I support you completly Chris! I just had this discussion with someone last night. Set aside Government mandates. Continue masking and social distancing to protect the spread of COVID for family, friends, and community. Just do it - damn it. We are still sick and dying."
1400,181673732,Amy Kelsall,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,29 Mar,Thank You Chris! I couldn‚Äôt agree more. How can others be so uncaring about lives other than their own and resistant to such a simple task?
1401,181673732,Amy Kelsall,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,29 Mar,"I would rather have fear mongering than people dying. Everyone has a different level of health, susceptibility and risk factors for illness.  The shot takes some time to be fully effective."
1402,181673732,SK Kim,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,29 Mar,I‚Äôm sorry this is happening.  My family and I are nearly all vaccinated but we will continue to mask to help our other community members who have not gotten the vaccine yet.
1403,181673732,Chris Watson,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,29 Mar,"Cappy is correct.  And if you don‚Äôt believe Cappy, check the CDC website. It is awkward for the scientists to admit, but the reason they are still advocating that vaccinated people still wear masks is to keep it being the norm so that those not vaccinated will keeping wearing masks.  "
1404,181673732,Mike Stephens,‚Ä¢ City Park,29 Mar,I‚Äôm a mask wearer. Point is so many people don‚Äôt care. Complaining will do nothing. So if u don‚Äôt feel comfortable you should stay home. Heck we have two months and this is all moot
1405,181673732,Mike Stephens,‚Ä¢ City Park,29 Mar,That‚Äôs right Cappy! It‚Äôs in the science
1406,181673732,Mark Ryan,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,29 Mar,"Real issue is that we aren‚Äôt addressing risk. It seems that Fauci and others are thinking that we can get to zero risk from Covid. That isn‚Äôt going to happen. Covid is going to be around, killing people, for some time.  That will go down, but it won‚Äôt go to zero. Unfortunately we live in a society that thinks we can get to a zero risk, and worse will put in place policies that are outsized to the benefits."
1407,181673732,Chris Watson,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,29 Mar,"Yes.  There are things that arose high risk of transmission, and things that pose low risk.  The scientists are not forthcoming about what is more or less risky, so you have to do some research and put some logic in place.  Walking down the street minding your own business without a mask is VERY low risk to anybody.  It‚Äôs OUTSIDE, for crying out loud!  "
1408,181673732,Mike Stephens,‚Ä¢ City Park,29 Mar,Of course they take it down Betty. Doesn‚Äôt fit the left narrative.
1409,181673732,Kristin Olson,‚Ä¢ Hale,30 Mar,"Did you people all freak out about getting a cold before?? I can‚Äôt believe the insanity of this idiocracy. The stupid box even says it doesn‚Äôt prevent viruses. Our immune systems are amazing. If the media wasn‚Äôt pushing all this fear you wouldn‚Äôt be constantly reminded of it. If you want to wear a mask, go for it. If healthy, unafraid humans don‚Äôt wish to wear one, don‚Äôt be a jerk to them. You can stay home or whatever you wish to do. You‚Äôll be fine."
1410,181673732,Bob Klein,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,30 Mar,"If the box is stupid, maybe it's wrong?"
1411,168849211,Shabnam Razmpour,‚Ä¢ Lowry,24 Nov,"You may find a free tent on Facebook marketplace, Craigslist or here in free listings. Hope can find one! So he can have it"
1412,168849211,Kathleen Rowland,‚Ä¢ Lowry,24 Nov,"Impact Humanity has a store with free clothing etc for anyone who needs it.  Located at 2526 Welton Street Denver, co 80205.

Large enough for 2 people and a dog.  Should I see if it's still available?  Or, did you get one already?  If not, I could get it and donate to him."

1437,168849211,Katie Lindenberg,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,25 Nov,I think so :(
1438,185860472,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 days ago,Hi Isaac.... Go Blue!
1439,173805815,Laurie Saltzman,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,14 Jan,"There is one at 5th and Marion in front of a church, 13th and Williams and 26th and Williams."
1440,173805815,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,15 Jan,OK so I found out about two new places recently:
1441,173805815,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,15 Jan,"(also if anyone knows of any others, I would love to know too!  I don't drive, so the closer things are, the easier it is)"
1442,173805815,Laurie Saltzman,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,15 Jan,I have been to the 3 that I gave addresses for. One is the one on Williams listed above. None of those 3 take perishable items.
1443,173805815,Erin Fishburn,‚Ä¢ Hale,15 Jan,"Thank you all, I drove by the three that Laurie mentioned and will continue to make donations regularly."
1444,173805815,Marissa Star,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Jan,"I FILL A BOX and go down town . I follow the homeless camps set up then pick one and leave the box. ILL yell , anyone hungry? Or, anyone cold ? "
1445,173805815,Erin Fishburn,‚Ä¢ Hale,15 Jan,"I was considering creating/purchasing a little free pantry for Hale/Mayfair neighborhood. I'd love to put it in Lindsley Park, but unsure if 1) neighbors would be interested or 2) I would need to get permission from the city to place on there. "
1446,173805815,Laura Hinrichs,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,17 Jan,It would probably be a good idea to check with the city.  I‚Äôm thinking the parks and rec division
1447,169719981,Cherie Oertel,‚Ä¢ Lowry,4 Dec,I am collecting for homeless would take it all and could pick up?
1448,169719981,Jessica Jimmy,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,4 Dec,Ok when can you pick it up
1449,169410487,Timothy Carter,‚Ä¢ Hale,1 Dec,"We have a new group on next door ""Denver Homeless Out Loud"""
1450,169410487,Barbara Moriarty,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,3 Dec,Thank you for  posting about this . I‚Äôm so over people pointing their fingers at people that have no where to go .  I have never been homeless but I have take the time to get to know some of the homeless people and they suffer from trauma and have been hurt . They feel abandoned by society and they take drugs to numb because they have nothing and don‚Äôt want to feel anything. . If only people got that and acted with love the world would be so much of a better place . :(
1451,169410487,Bill Zuckata,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,1 Dec,I support City of Denver protecting residents and enforcing the law.
1452,169410487,Carrie Stiles,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,1 Dec,Good luck.
1453,169410487,Barbara Moriarty,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,3 Dec,"That‚Äôs why Denver  has become such an uncaring place because it‚Äôs full of  entitled people like you .let me guess you have your Biden and blm sign on your front lawn but oh yes so many of you don‚Äôt walk your talk .  I hope you never end up in bad situation and don‚Äôt have a place to live . Why don‚Äôt you go hand the homeless people some trash bags and give them the tools to not make such a mess . Because yes I do walk my talk and I have time for everyone and I took  a homeless person last quarantine you onjy have a neighbor complain to my landlady about me . I have almost nothing but I have bought groceries for people that were hungry on Colfax and Colorado , I brought the guy camping out on corner of Colfax and Colorado $30 of food last week , he was sleeping anonhst his trash. I went home and o got him a sleeping bag , a sleeping pad , a tarp , a heavy weighted blanket ; hat gloves and warm pants and toilet paper and yes trash bags !! And I told him ‚Äú lick your trash up because otherwise they‚Äôll move you on.  The next day he had picked most of it up . He can‚Äôt talk allot but his eyes and his high five said it all . "
1454,169410487,Darcy Strayer,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 Dec,I‚Äôm in.
1455,175020187,Carrie Stiles,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,We do not have a substation nearby.  That's the problem.
1456,175020187,Jerson Alvarenga,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,"Well they don't care about us, this is my fifth report,  nothing has happened, the violence in the other hand has increased."
1457,175020187,Carrie Stiles,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,"Crime has been historically low here so we have no substation.  Now with covid, it sometimes feels like, a free-for-all.  I have lived in the Hilltop-Crestmoor area for about 13 years and never experienced any crime/theft.  In the last 4 months, I have had at least three packages stolen from my porch."
1458,175020187,Jerson Alvarenga,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,"I think your comment speak for itself,  u had suffered crime too."
1459,175020187,Zakaria Chamseddine,‚Ä¢ Glendale,26 Jan,This is hard even to watch! They looked ready for anything. They could kill anyone in their way! Hope you and your family are safe.
1460,175020187,Jerson Alvarenga,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,Accordingly with the police department they didn't used deadly force.
1461,175020187,Matt Hodel,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,26 Jan,"I can't believe someone has the nerve to do that, thugs. I would be pleasurable to let people like stamp license plates for a few years for acting like low life fools."
1462,175020187,Carrie Stiles,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,"It apparently hasn‚Äôt affected me as much as you.  The police don‚Äôt have access to ND.  They can post on it but not read comments as I understand it.  From a practical perspective, I‚Äôd figure out how to lobby for a local substation for lasting change."
1463,175020187,Matt Hodel,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,26 Jan,"I told the police I was going to handle it my way when I live in Clayton and they were slow to show up. You tell a 911 answer robot person this, the popo comes running quickly to come see what's going to transpire."
1464,175020187,Mary Flower,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,26 Jan,"but you must be truthful about being prepared to handle it yourself. If you just ""say that"" to get the cops to come out, YOU will be in more trouble than, possibly, the criminals"
1465,175020187,Matt Hodel,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,28 Jan,"Mary Flower no this is real life and something that I did, I have no problems with confronting criminals in the act. And what happens, happens."
1466,175020187,Katie Curler,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,These thugs are wearing patagonia and knew to look away from the camera and to go in garage? Any chance you had workers there recently that you could have police look into? I agree crime has sky rocketed in last 2 weeks... we got hit monday at 5am but just porch pirates (white methy kids)
1467,175020187,Matt Hodel,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,26 Jan,"Exactly, well off white dudes in designer clothing- good point. Something is off."
1468,175020187,Vikki Scharnhorst,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,"Please send a note to our City Council representative, Amanda Sawyer."
1469,175020187,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,"Amanda Sawyer is getting ready to make it worse on FEB 8th when she votes yes to changing the zoning code to 20 people in one home, shelters, and halfway houses allowed everywhere without permits. Out city council is getting ready to make a horrid situation worse. I am so sorry for this happening to you and our city that has gone to hell."
1470,175020187,Mark Ryan,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,ND has gone from lost dogs and kittens to lost hope....
1471,175020187,leo vizi,‚Ä¢ South Hilltop,26 Jan,most of these crimes couldve been prevented. dont blame police
1472,175020187,Mark Ryan,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,"Is this the 'unlooked footlocker' theory of stopping thievery?  How much should we up-armor our houses?  The OP has plenty of light, cameras.  Maybe a moat or portcullis?  Armed drones?"
1473,175020187,JA Schmalen,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,26 Jan,Where about in Hilltop?
1474,175020187,Kevin Zepp,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,You need to put signs all around your property that's has a gun on the picture and says you don't call 911
1475,175020187,Susan Kabir,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,26 Jan,"Similarly, I visited someone's house once who had taped to the front door her paper (human silhouette) shooting target with bullet holes showing her excellent aim.  'Nuff said."
1476,175020187,Mary Flower,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,26 Jan,Kevin Zepp  There is one issue with this.... It can be said (and I'm just playing devils advocate here) that a sign like that proves intent. You fully intended to injure/maim/kill whoever did whatever on/to your property. In some cases it can be seen as an admission of guilt - just like the sign Beware Of Dog - you are admitting you have a vicious animal.
1477,175020187,Kevin Zepp,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jan,Maybe get a mean dog too
1478,175020187,Janice Kerr,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,26 Jan,Very unfortunate. Wishing we could 'crowd source' this problem as a neighborhood and offer a cash reward to anyone who can identify the thieves.
1479,175020187,Carrie Stiles,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,Extra footage of the guys leaving with property would be helpful.
1480,175020187,Laurie Jensen,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,26 Jan,"In 2005 I lived in Mayfair and my home was burglarized in the middle of the day when my neighbors were home. We lost over $15,000 in property. When we arrived home and reported it to the police it took over 3 hrs for them to arrive. They told us to sit outside our home until they got there so we wouldn‚Äôt mess up the scene. Then we had to stay at a friends house until the police showed up to finger print the place. A full 24 hours later the house was finally fingerprinted, but the criminals were wearing latex gloves, so my house was obviously not their first rodeo. (They had also cut the phone line and switched off the power) At the time the police told us that there was over 30,000 burglaries in Denver annually and the police did not have enough resources to investigate crimes involving property. It sounds like a whole lot hasn‚Äôt changed. They also told us the homes that were previously burglarized were likely to be hit again because the criminals know people have insurance and will just replace the stolen stuff with new stuff. It‚Äôs sad to say but the people who break into peoples homes do this as a full time job. The best way to deter your home from being broken into is to make your house a lesser target then your neighbors which probably means putting bars on your windows and doors and a padlock on your electrical panel, which is terrible. Sorry to hear about it I know it is very upsetting."
1481,175020187,Jean T.,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,14w,Thank u for all the info! I'm sorry this happened to you. Do you know why they shut off the power?(edited)
1482,175020187,Laurie Jensen,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,26 Jan,That‚Äôs not true Colorado has a ‚Äúmake my day‚Äù law that allows you to shoot any person that enters your home if you feel your life is at risk. You can shoot someone through a wall without seeing or talking to them if think you are being broken into and your safety is at risk. See: https://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/31/colorado-make-my-day-law/ 
1483,175020187,Jerson Alvarenga,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,"It's seems that cops don't know about that law, because they said u are not allow to do it"
1484,175020187,Jerson Alvarenga,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jan,I just said of what they said to me.
1485,175020187,Laurie Jensen,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,26 Jan,"I didn‚Äôt realize that they broke into your garage, not your home. No you can‚Äôt shoot someone that breaks into a detached garage no matter how much you would like. Looks like you need a security door on the garage, that would probably solve that problem."
1486,175020187,Michael Bares,‚Ä¢ Country Club,27 Jan,"Actually, that is incorrect.  Detached garages are covered under the Make my day law.   It is still considered part of the home under recent case law.   "
1487,175020187,Meg Harry,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,28 Jan,"You can protect the ‚Äúcurtilage‚Äù of your home-legal term-and it includes your garage/yard, etc. I learned it in law school 26 years ago and is still in effect"

No kill doesn't actually mean ""no kill"", it's very misleading. ""No kill' generally means the shelter has a 90%+ live release rate. Shelters will still euthanize if it's in the best interest of the animal (suffering or poor quality of life) or the animal is considered unsafe to adopt due to behavior."

Personally we adopted an awesome dog from A Friend of Jack, they were very easy to work with and communicative and flexible. If you are looking for a specific size of dog, I would use the Pet Finder website. It will aggregate all the available dogs from tons of places so you don't have to individually search every rescues page. I'd double check the rescue'd google reviews before you apply just to make sure they are a reputable organization."
1517,176661150,Lynn Wagner,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Feb,"Yes, this is sound advice to use Petfinder + rescue recommendations. Keep a list of Rescues of Yes/No, because after a while, they all sound the same."

1538,176514579,Jesus Barraza,‚Ä¢ Hale,11 Feb,"I keep hearing garages broken into, cars broken into, even houses. Most of the neighbors that have this happen they dont have a security camera and first thing they want to do is check to see who around  them have one. Thiefs walk around scoping the vulnerable houses or cars etc. Im sure they dont just rob a garage without first knowing if it has cameras or some protection. Neighbors until you realize that it may happen to you thats when you will get a camera. They are so easy to install and so easy to scare thiefs away. They scope around all times of the day. Ive caught a few snopping around and when they see the camera they freak out and leave. I worked to buy my tools and I won't let anyone steal  them from me. If you value ur stuff protect it or else we are going to keep having this type of incidents. Correct me if I'm wrong please. Most the break ins I have read on here come from unprotected houses without cameras. They get robbed then they go buy cameras. Lets try getting them before that happens. It will help the rest of the neighbors and eventually minimize the thefts. I think. But again I only know that I know nothing."

David is 37 years old.  He said he could use a pair of pants (the pair he has on is pretty torn up with holes)--he wears a size 38x32 if anyone reading this has any on hand to donate.  His shirt is XL and a thermal or two could go a long way.  It's cold out.  Thanks for looking out for him...I've debated about posting as I don't want to cause him problems or freak anyone out.

1598,167406476,Lynn Turner,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,11 Nov,"Hi Neighbors,  I've looked into housing stability resources for David.  Many of the 'go-to' shelters have had a hard time accommodating our homeless due to covid restrictions and have suspended lotteries until the end of 2020.  That puts many of our at risk in a tough spot.  The last snowfall was overwhelming and there are simply not enough resources.  I cannot imagine hearing 'don't send them here' in a time of need.  That said, there is a NEW program called STAR (Support Team Alternative Response) 720-913-STAR that is a homeless outreach team whose mission is to connect people in need (not just homeless) with resources and provide a level of consistency with their care that exceeds a drive to a shelter.  They will have the most current information available whether that might be hotel vouchers/shelter updates/food supplies/etc.  The van that responds will provide a social worker and a medical professional together, not a police officer.  This resource is through the Denver Dept of Housing Stability and they are looking to expand this program, partly by disseminating this information to our community for cases like David.  I have reached out to STAR on David's behalf and I'll talk to him today about their visit.  Please keep this resource in mind and share.  Thank you again."

1691,168588685,Susan Hobbins,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,22 Nov,We approached him at the park and offered help. He sort of growled. I asked if we should go away and he said yes.
1692,168588685,Mark Lauriha,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,22 Nov,I asked too and received the same response.  I do not know his story.
1693,168588685,Debra Roads,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,22 Nov,I have approached him as well with food/drinks. He did not want anything.
1694,168588685,Michael Gross,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,23 Nov,Likewise

1698,168588685,Daryl Porter,‚Ä¢ Hale,23 Nov,Just saw his wheelchair in the alley again...turned around to give him my lunch (ham and cheese sandwich) and a bottled water.

1702,168588685,Greg Movesian,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,23 Nov,I see him pretty regularly while walking my dog.  I think someone is looking after him - dropping him off and picking him up.

1705,168588685,Kristy Center,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,24 Nov,there is a home for persons with severe mental illness in the neighborhood.(with staff etc) he might live there.
1706,168588685,Mark Thomas,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Dec,I was just out walking my dog (around 10:30pm) and saw this guy parked in his wheelchair on the sidewalk around 12th & Monroe... He appeared to be looking at the screen of a cell phone.  It‚Äôs really cold out there so I‚Äôm concerned for his well-being.  If he‚Äôs refusing help as everyone here has noted not sure if anything can be done- sad situation.
1707,168588685,Patrick Donovan,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14 Dec,He is sleeping in his chair outside the new cvs at 9th and colorado.  I don‚Äôt think he wants help .
1708,168588685,Kim Eis,‚Ä¢ City Park West,19 Dec,Is he an amputee w/a baby lab? I saw a guy in a wheelchair a few days ago who seemed to linger outside around park & 17th. He said he lived in caulk but he sure seemed to be outside quite long despite the cold.
1709,168965705,Joan Baronberg,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,27 Nov,"Katie, It sounds great to help him get off begging, but how is money to help him do that? What needs to go along with that and who can provide it (program, requirements, monitoring) so that changing his ways is more profitable (from his eyes) than begging?"
1710,168965705,Katie Lindenberg,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,27 Nov,"Joan, No one wants to stand outside in the cold all day, ‚Äúbegging‚Äù. It‚Äôs an incredibly tough life, that is hardly profitable. He wants it to change. The money would go towards helping him secure long-term housing so that he can get a job. It‚Äôs not possible to get a steady job when you are worried about where you are going to sleep at night."
1711,168965705,Joan Baronberg,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,27 Nov,"Katie Lindenberg Katie, His situation is not unlike the ones that professionals have dealt with for decades. Why not speak with some of the folks at Stout St. or another place who have experience dealing with such situations? That way you are more likely to not just feel good about helping a desperate person but learn about How to really be helpful."
1712,168965705,Katie Lindenberg,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,23w,"I am, thank you. If you have any additional resources, please feel free to pass along. I don‚Äôt pretend to know the best way to help everyone. This is not the first homeless man I am helping, nor will it be my last.

1752,185498107,Elizabeth Restat,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,2 May,Stephanie Subramanian thank you!
1753,185498107,Jennifer Crick,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,2 May,Try a lot of magnesium as well !
1754,185498107,Elizabeth Restat,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,2 May,I've been trying to work my way up to higher doses. It upsets my stomach so I've been using oil
1755,185498107,Debra Roads,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,2 May,I have had migraines since a young child and tried to manage them with chiropractic care and massage with some improvement.  I started botox 10 years ago and it changed my life. Tried many other medications first but the meds definately interfered with my cognitive ability.
1756,185498107,Elizabeth Restat,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,2 May,If you're willing to DM about it would appreciate it. A couple of people have mentioned that to me but I wouldn't know where to start
1757,185498107,Michelle Honald,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,2 May,"I use Dr. McNutt (neurologist) for oversight. He‚Äôs great. The reality is that migraines are individual to each person and it can take a long time to parse what‚Äôs going on (for instance, I have migraine as well as sinus and tension headaches and they all require different treatment). I always say it takes a village as my ideal formula contains chiro, massage, dry needling, Botox, migraine meds and stretching."
1758,185498107,Robin Howe,‚Ä¢ Hale,6 days ago,He is awesome
1759,185498107,Jan Holland-Beachley,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,1w,"I‚Äôm going to throw something out there. I used to have what I thought were all migraines but I learned that some of my symptoms were actually related to dry sinuses from living in Denver. I learned that any time I get a headache to FIRST do some nasal washes to see what impact it has on the headache. For me, if reduced my symptoms tremendously. You will have to see how much it will help you. I never imagined it would be so helpful.(edited)"
1760,185498107,Kelly O'Connor,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,3 May,"Piggybacking on this Thanks Jan, I have tried saline spray, it‚Äôs done nothing, windows open etc."
1761,185498107,Elizabeth Restat,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,3 May,"That's an interesting thought. I hadn't thought about it being sinuses because I don't have a lot of pain, just aura and sensitivity to light with weird hollow pain on one side. But I own a neti pot and I'll try ANYTHING at this point."
1762,185498107,Mel Wilson,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 May,"Gees, that is great info. My roommate has chronic migraines. As soon as she awakes, her head starts throbbing. Will try to get her to try it. Thanks. üòä"
1763,185498107,Kelly O'Connor,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,3 May,"I feel your pain, and moved here 2 years ago and mine have gotten much worse."
1764,185498107,Elizabeth Restat,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,3 May,I'm at about 18 months. I wonder if this is the Denver version of seasonal allergies.
1765,185498107,Ann Marie,‚Ä¢ Cherry - Leetsdale,3 May,There is a migraine clinic at CU Anschutz which may be of help.
1766,185498107,Gary Rosenzweig,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,3 May,"Elizabeth, after you find a specialist, please be sure to ask about whether these are not migraines, but ""Cluster Headaches."" These are way more common that people realize, but often go undiagnosed as ""just migraines."" I went 45 years suffering from cluster headaches until I got a proper diagnosis. Your description sounds very similar to what I experienced. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache"
1767,185498107,Mikki Lind,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,3 May,What have you done about your CH's?  I have never had headaches my whole life until about 3 years ago.  Took about a year to diagnose as Cluster Headaches.  These are constant and debilitating!  They have really compromised my quality of life as they come on after about 1-1/2 hours of sleep and I can have as many as 6 a day.  Any ideas would be greatly welcome!!!
1768,185498107,Stephanie Berberich,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,3 May,I second the recommendation for Trevor McNutt. He's helped me manage my migraines for over 15 years. He is terrific!
1769,185498107,Kelly O'Connor,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,3 May,"I wish I knew have been suffering from Massive migraines with Vertigo & Nausea for way too many years. Too many Drs medicines, no cure."
1770,185498107,Aly Bitter,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,3 May,"I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with that.  I find that the weather changing as much as it has lately really throws my migraines into gear.  I‚Äôm such a proponent for chiropractic care & massages but would also suggest looking into TMJ, food sensitivity/allergies, and earthing/grounding."
1771,185498107,susan saul,‚Ä¢ Country Club,3 May,Get yourself to a good neurologist. Botox may help your headaches.
1772,185498107,Wanda Harris,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,1w,Often it has to do with narrowing of spinal column.  You might have a slight swelling or a disc is moving around.  Also-  staying away from non natural sugars helps.  Poor sleep is a big concern too. Circulation of oxygen is what is best.  That‚Äôs why message often helps.  Acupuncture has been a big relief for many. 
1773,185498107,Alison Kenda,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,4 May,"I absolutely love Dr Chantal O'Brian at UCHealth. She got my migraines under control. Her process was thoughtful and holistic. (She found a vitamin deficiency that was contributing to some of my issues, for example.) She isn't just a 'let's throw the latest meds at it' kind of Neurologist."
1774,185498107,Katherine Sheppard,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,4 May,Highly recommend a publication by the American Academy of Neurology!  Comes out every two months digitally or mailed to your house...FREE!!!  Just a great read for anyone suffering from a neurological condition!! üíó
1775,185498107,Elizabeth Restat,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,6 days ago,This is awesome thank you!
1776,185498107,Kaylee Simms,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,5 days ago,Also consider an Ayurvedic.
1777,185498107,Anne Hines,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 days ago,"I go to Summit Headache near Swedish hospital. They really helped get my migraines under control. No caffeine really helped. Caffeine upregulates adenosine receptors in the brain. These lower your threshold for pain. So a little HA can easily become a migraine. Cut the caffeine, and your threshold gradually increases. I still get migraines, but they are rarely Big Bad Daddies any more. I also take magnesium. Also, started taking  Aimovig in the last year. It blocks the CGRP receptor. This is a preventive. It doesn't work for everyone, but for me it really slashed the frequency of migraines."

They can try on clothes and then check out at the register, with no charge in the end. For furniture/household items, the Rescue Mission has the same kind of shop across from the Pct 2 PD station on Holly. You still get a tax receipt, too."

1801,180106097,Megan Leinard,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14 Mar,I think we‚Äôre missing the point here my friends
1802,180106097,Matt Duffy,‚Ä¢ City Park West,14 Mar,"It's a good sentiment Megan, but the wealth divide and our tolerance for it have been themes of all civilizations since time immemorial. It is absolutely true that our political class has made nil efforts, and has even exacerbated (under good intentions!) the sufferings of our growing poor. Class action can't be reached through NextDoor. You have to take the initiative yourself and become the betterment in these peoples lives, you have to devote yourself to the alleviation of suffering. Why should we expect politicians to legislate humane action when we cannot even ask it of ourselves? Why constantly expect larger entitites to do things that we fail to do on a daily basis? The political class is not a separate entity from the public - they come from the public, they come from us. If our pervasive attitude is that we don't have enough individual power to enact monumental change, why should we expect our political leaders to? They are middlemen between our oligarchical interests and the facade of goodwill they must perform should they wish to remain in power. They feel as powerless as we do, but they have the resources at their hands, they have the connections they need. Recontextualizing our own ability to service those in need will actually inspire a future political class to realize they have it in themselves to do something. So long as we complain about the inaction of others to make a change in the world will be further reinforce the cynicism that pervades political and local action - that the phenoma is too large, too out of our control. The phenomena is on your corner. Give him a blanket."
1803,180106097,Megan Leinard,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14 Mar,"Ok, I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre on the same page."
1804,180106097,Christopher Hudson,‚Ä¢ Country Club,8w,"Let me be honest. We live in a cities today where a six figure income can be the poverty line. I pay over 2k a month in rent. I promise you, I don‚Äôt feel cozy or safe. I‚Äôm sometimes a paycheck away from affording groceries until the next pay day. Yet I find a way to give; sometimes more than I can afford. There are days I wonder how I‚Äôll make it to the next. But each pay I budget and I move on, not beating myself up if I ‚Äúoverspend‚Äù. I hope to one day buy a house but I mostly see the remote affordable places swooped up by people who renovate and then sell for profit or make the house more unaffordable the next time it‚Äôs on the market. Yes I‚Äôm sitting inside my cozy rental and thinking about the people who are forced to live outside and hoping that I can one day do way more that the little I‚Äôm doing donating clothes, money, food and time.(edited)"

1861,164866864,Kammy Alford,‚Ä¢ City Park West,17 Oct,Wait...the Denver Rescue Mission is charging $10 a night for homeless people to stay there overnight?  Seriously?  What a lot of people want is for the homeless to have a place to stay and not be creating homeless shelters in front of their homes.  What homeless person has $10 per day...$70 a week or $280 a month to pay to sleep inside for one night.  Am I missing something?

1878,167403966,Chloe Adams,‚Ä¢ CBD,10 Nov,"The Salvation Army doesn‚Äôt help gay, trans, or non-Christian homeless people and their facilities are ripe with abuse. I feel like this is gonna hurt more people than it helps, especially since now people will be arguing that there are more shelters so homeless people shouldn‚Äôt be on the streets when the shelters might be significantly worse."

1881,167403966,Sam G.,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,10 Nov,Please don't slander an institution when a simple search of their website will prove that the SA serves all who are in need:
1882,167403966,Robin M.,‚Ä¢ Barnum,10 Nov,"The official policy of Salvation Army is no discrimination; but as Yogi Berra said, ""In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is."" The actions of some Salvation Army facilities or programs have differed from their official policy. Their history in this is not great. We'll have to see if these facilities live up to their word."
1883,167403966,ernie s.,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,10 Nov,"False comparison. I‚Äôm actually truth the SA does, in fact, serve all. Really, you should try it yourself."
1884,167403966,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,10 Nov,"Right, so in a world where needs are great for many of the weakest, endeavor to shut down organizations such as the Salvation Army and Catholic Charities, cancel them, and then send cards to all of those who they have and would have continued providing assistance to, expressing * how sorry you all are for facilitating their continued struggle, but they weren't fair to everyone, according to the expectations of many ,who so often need little help in the same way, at all. *"
1885,167403966,Rick G.,‚Ä¢ Bear Valley West,10 Nov,How many times does it take me unsubscribing when it actually works‚Ä¶
1886,167403966,Heather Doolittle,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,10 Nov,"Rick G. I was wondering the same thing! Apparently, now that next-door is curating their own content, they subscribed everyone to it. If you go to your settings, you can unsubscribe from all of this junk."
1887,167403966,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,10 Nov,"...or just click the down arrow in the upper right of the post field, and click 'turn off notifications', and then again to click ""hide post'."
1888,167403966,Jeff H.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,10 Nov,"The SA Handbook of Doctrine includes some passages that cite a portion of the Bible (Romans 1:18-32), which advocates for the exclusion, in the tamest sense, to the killing of LGBTQ people, in the extreme interpretation. The Salvation Army is not an inclusive organization."
1889,167403966,ernie s.,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,10 Nov,Totally untrue and a simple google search uncovers this fabrication to anyone who actually cares about inclusion. 
1890,167403966,Florence S.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,10 Nov,"What about the Johnson and Wales Campus? 25 acres, turnkey ready, for homeless and transitional housing, and currently for sale. The City says they are committed to this issue, but then depends on other organizations. An additional $41M tax measure was just passed. Seems like more ""talk"" and less ""walk."""

1895,167403966,ernie s.,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,10 Nov,"Total BS. Spreading this type of lie is damaging to anyone and everyone who seeks shelter anywhere. By repeating these lies, you actually damage the challenge of inclusivity by building a straw man argument when there is plenty of actual discrimination taking place."
1896,167403966,Chloe Adams,‚Ä¢ CBD,10 Nov,Forgot to mention that you‚Äôre REQUIRED to pray before they‚Äôll feed you https://mobile.twitter.com/kivanbay/status/934607972415631360
1897,167403966,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,26w,"What then, a person gets help on their own terms, w/o any thankfulness for that help?  Should they pray to you?  Honestly, if I were hungry, and in Iran, and for food, for a meal, I was asked to pray to Allah, I would, from my lips, but not my heart, which is the issue; I wouldn't take it personally."
1898,167403966,J Kendel J.,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,26w,"In my experience, any attempt to help is usually grounded in good intentions. The Salvation Army might set policy to be inclusive, but that doesn't mean that a lot of practicing Christians within their organization might not behave in unwelcoming, discriminating or other hurtful ways."

1900,167403966,Lois A.,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights North,10 Nov,"From my experience when I lived in southern California, the Salvation Army did much good for all of society, providing immunizations, helping cloth and feed the poor etc. I was not religious the thirty years while living there and had no personal experience directly with them other than to get a pneumonia shot and annual flu shots. Everything I heard about the organization was good. I think we currently live in an age where it is considered cool to criticize and tear down everything that has been good."

1902,167403966,William M.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,26w,"The Salvation Army has done great things. If you don't like them don't go and don't donate. But some Radical Haters would rather Salvation Army close and let the Thousand upon thousands they help with food, clothing, shelter, safety, mental help, and love wonder the streets.(edited)"
1903,167403966,ernie s.,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,10 Nov,This dragging of the SA happens every year about this time. Folks like to think they are commanding the High Moral Ground when they are actually just showing how easily they can be mislead‚òπÔ∏è
1904,167403966,William M.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,26w,"The best way to find out about the Salvation Army is to get off your duff and get a first hand experience! Walk amongst those who need help. The poor, the homeless, and the needy! Holidays are here and they could use volunteers! You will meet some of the finest humble and compassionate people working there. The ""Customers"" are people from all walks of life. Most were living fine lives till disaster hit. Some didn't choose life to go bad, but sometimes it finds them. Others live the drug life even though they were from privileged life! They need help, and the volunteer at Salvation Army, or any other place like them, can provide tremendous help by just listening. Volunteer, and they will find something for you to do. Don't be one of the privileged who has never done anything but sit home and complain about things you have NO experience with. Don't be a complainer - be a supporter!(edited)"

God has blessed with having them in our lives, and hope to be able to give and help someone in need."

1930,175223195,Lorie Nelson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,28 Jan,"While this is cool,  moreover, it is representative of the best of our humanity. I wonder what happened to us as people sometimes. I remember when I was 6 years old, (1956 for the historians out there), living in San Francisco during a time when there was no aid for parents with children in need. One particular evening when my single mother and I had only a few Lipton tea bags and a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese left in the the kitchen cabinet, we argued about who would eat it; she wanting me to have it and I insisting that she have it.  Neither of us ate that night. We did boil some water to make some tea. Even though it was the most common of teas, It was the most delicious tea ever that night . The next day she went to a job interview and fainted during the interview. The man said, ""you haven't had anything to eat have you?"" he took her to a cafe down the street and bought breakfast, he hired her and gave her an advance on her salary so she could buy groceries. I will never forget his  kindness, his humanity."

1934,175223195,Simon Lofts,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,29 Jan,It sounds as if lips are smacking all across town now.
1935,175223195,Robin Wells,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,29 Jan,"Indeed, I‚Äôve looked at the menu to decide what I‚Äôll have for dinner tonight"
1936,175223195,Scott Lobo,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,29 Jan,What a great example of kindness particularly in this difficult time. Peter is such an awesome soul and his food is spectacular!
1937,175223195,Jessica Paulk,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14w,Peter is so generous. I once needed a 1/2 cup of rice for a recipe and went there to buy some. He just gave it to me. And his sesame chicken is delicious.(edited)
1938,175223195,Ed Beckman,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,29 Jan,Good to hear. I'll try eating there. Thanks.
1939,175223195,Donna Ryan,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,29 Jan,I remember when I picked up my to-go order once and happened to mention to him that it was my birthday dinner. He didn‚Äôt charge me for my meal! So nice!

1941,169666926,Cindy Freehauf,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 Dec,Thanks for sharing your story snd sorry this happened to you. I no doubt have seen your RV in area described. With luck we may meet each other. :)
1942,169666926,Karla Simons,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,3 Dec,I live on Bellaire and have seen a few small RVs parked.  Why on earth would this be a bother to anyone? Carry on and don‚Äôt think one dissenting voice speaks for us all!
1943,169666926,Nancy Vaughan,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 Dec,So sorry.  Things are hard enough for hospital workers these days as it is.  Thank you for your work.
1944,169666926,Christina Neidig,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,3 Dec,Thank you for your service whatever you do At the hospital it greatly appreciated ! I live over around 14 and Milwaukee I am pretty close to several hospitals if you ever need a place to park just reach out in the comments or privately and I would be more than happy to let you park in front of my home I have two parking spots in the back of my house that I utilize so there‚Äôs never anyone parked in front of my home!
1945,169666926,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 Dec,When I was in the hospital for 3 weeks I got to know some of the nurses. I can't blame you for trying to find reasonable accommodations especially when they were expected to relieve the current staff at 10pm (and likely had to get there sooner than that) and were scheduled for 12 hour shifts. One nurse lived in the Springs and I can see this as a very reasonable accommodation. It might be wise to move the RV periodically as some parking in residential areas either requires a permit or is limited to three days.
1946,169666926,marcia jones,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,4 Dec,The hospital should apply for special permits for their staff during this COVID situation.  Sorry they haven't thought of this.
1947,169666926,Molly Ream,‚Ä¢ City Park,4 Dec,"I love the use of our, it is ours, you included.  City sidewalks is in a Christmas song I believe. Thank you for your hard work and be well."

1953,169666926,Gabriel Kaplan,‚Ä¢ City Park,4 Dec,Sorry for this person and thank you for working on the front lines during this crisis.
1954,169666926,Jeff Carlisle-Tierno,‚Ä¢ Hale,4 Dec,"If I saw the person doing it, forget good graces. I‚Äôd straight up tell them to go pound sand. The street is in the public domain, and if you‚Äôre legally parked on it, there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it."
1955,169666926,Sam Allen,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Dec,Sorry for the person who wrote the note. Thank you so much for your service. Hospital personnel are our front line workers. Hugs to all hospital workers!!!
1956,169666926,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Dec,"If not already, I recommend you check with the local police precinct and share your story so the parking ticket trolls don‚Äôt get you. It might help to have a modest windshield sign indicating your front line role. To the note writer, a thousand fleas in their armpits."
1957,169666926,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Dec,"And if you wish, pm me for a parking spot not far away."
1958,169666926,Christie Koonse,‚Ä¢ Hale,4 Dec,There was an overzealous busybody on here a few months ago that saw trash in a car and was going to report it as abandoned! Not because it had been there too long. I sent a nice (really) reply and she removed her post.
1959,169666926,Trevor Mello,‚Ä¢ Hale,4 Dec,"Unfortunately i believe denver has a law about rv's, campers, 5th wheels etc parked on city streets. I think they only allow for so many days in same spot before u are ticketed."
1960,169666926,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Dec,I mentioned this above that on major streets they are limited to 3 days. Not sure on side streets. Still you can move the rv periodically
1961,169666926,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Dec,"With current covid and homelessness issues (the later creating safe parking zones), if the police are notified by a verified frontline medical worker, it should be okay. They might even work out a street permit. I have no doubt this will come up as cases spike over the next several months. I‚Äôm happy to help take this to City Council. Sad that the hospital isn‚Äôt behind their staff about this."
1962,169666926,Scott Hughes,‚Ä¢ Hale,4 Dec,that's a vigilante type thing and parking so yep you ain't alone ...
1963,169666926,Rosenda Ibanez,‚Ä¢ Hale,4 Dec,"I live on 12th and Birch you‚Äôre welcome to park on my street. Also, as a side note, maybe ask the Mental Health of Denver, see if they will let you park in their lot. It‚Äôs pretty open. Thanks for all you do!"
1964,169666926,Jerry De,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,4 Dec,The problem Rosenda is it is not your street!
1965,169666926,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,4 Dec,"The fact that they said ""not a campground"" makes me think this is some privileged person who hates on homeless people who are suffering quite enough and they assumed an RV meant someone who was homeless.  Either way, grrr!  I'm so sorry that happened to you."
1966,169666926,Robin Howe,‚Ä¢ Hale,4 Dec,"I live on Birch. We have to pay to store our rv. Not allowed in our driveway.  2 feet too long. The officer who wrote the complaint said its really only enforced if your neighbors call it in. Technically you are allowed to park on the street for a few days.Parking is hard on my street. If I kept it here, I would only have to move it every few days"
1967,163889566,Kathleen Green,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,8 Oct,What are the cross streets?
1968,163889566,Reed Miller,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,8 Oct,Jasmine and alameda.

1974,163889566,Reed Miller,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,9 Oct,He looks very similar but this guy didn‚Äôt have any arm tattoos.
1975,163889566,Katie Fogarty,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Oct,Reed Miller thanks for the reply.  So glad you caught the guy.
1976,163889566,JA Schmalen,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,9 Oct,"This is horrible, so glad you are safe! Which side of Alameda are you on?"
1977,163889566,Patricia Bainter,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Oct,"There was a post made last night, or the night before, about an attempted armed robbery at Alameda and Eudora. They may not be connected but perhaps that poster will see this and comment."

1980,163889566,Eric Wakefield,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,9 Oct,Damn! What a way to start off your day. So happy to hear that you guys were able to chase him down & get him on the ground until the police were able to arrive & take the dirt bag downtown. Hopefully he can be connected to other crimes that have been taking place around our neighborhoods. Great Job!
1981,163889566,Margere Weiss,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,10 Oct,We had a lot of young people racing around in cars last nite between 10:30pm- 11:30 on Clermont St.Prkway. Very unnerving.
1982,163889566,Eric Wakefield,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,10 Oct,I grew up in Hilltop & I‚Äôm a 3rd generation Colorado Native. Denver is not the same city that I grew up loving. Far too many people nowadays & the crime is out of control. It‚Äôs so sad that  our City‚Äôs vibe has changed for the worst.

1984,163889566,Emily May,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,30w,"Reed Miller - scary!!  was your front door unlocked or did the guy break down your front door?   You and your roommate were really on your toes.   I moved here in 1976 into Congress Park...and times have really changed since then, too.  Although there were neighborhood robberies back then.  Still not as blatant as today.(edited)"
1985,163889566,Reed Miller,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,12 Oct,"He had just unlocked the door after taking a dog outside in the morning. The man came a minute or so after he had just walked inside.

2003,176157650,Kristina H.,‚Ä¢ Havana,13w,"Pavel Yudanov the problem is the police don't do anything about it. When the find them they just tow them regardless of the prints they could find on stuff the idiots leave in the car but they know the cops won't do anything about it. So they'll continue to do it. They know there's no consequences unless they are caught and in reality the police don't do nothing. My jeep was stolen from my job on camera found two weeks later two miles away from.where it was stolen not far from the cop station. What did it leave me thousands of dollars behind, now a car payment that I didn't have with my jeep that I took care of the Jeep I put money into to make sure I didn't have a car payment, now I do. So I understand your frustrations I just wish the mayor the police and the state would do something about. Set up bait cars set a a task force to catch them... Just maybe when people are starting to go to jail and having to pay fines and do time the crime rate of car theft will come down.(edited)"

We found it (thanks to my wife) on here within 48 hours down the street, we will do a drive by there where we found ours (Mormon church off of 7th and Holly) an inconspicuous place to hold until selling. So sorry but I also draw the line with fitted ski boots. Have faith cops said NOW 80% chance return rate."

2013,176157650,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 Feb,I had my motorcycle stolen as well. It also was recovered a couple of blocks away. I suspect that they just want to get if away from the place it was stolen and likely have it towed later without being near the owners and drawing unwanted attention
2014,176157650,Jess Davis,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,6 Feb,That‚Äôs a really good point. My studio neighbor who is also my actual neighbor in some townhouses less than a block away had her husband‚Äôs work van stolen this past Fall. They found it a few blocks away about a week later. I think that‚Äôs a very good point. Look everywhere in your own neighborhood. It‚Äôs worth a shot
2015,176157650,Annita Menogan,‚Ä¢ Central Park,12 Feb,Jess Davis this is also a heads up for neighbors to pay attention to unusual vehicles left in the block. Could be stolen or not. But good to verify. We had a car parked in front of our house for over a week. I asked one of our neighbors if they knew who the owner was. It was actually one of the neighbors across the street who was having some work done and using the garage. So that was fine. But another time we had an abandoned car on our block. So let‚Äôs all keep our eyes open.
2016,176157650,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 Feb,I‚Äôm sorry your truck and boots were stolen! I am so tired of this happening!  Can you post a picture so we all can help you find?  Baseball bat stay tuned!!!

2029,176157650,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,9 Feb,They are probably using one of those devices that can hijack the electronic signal from those electronic keys. That will allow them to open the door(s) and start the car to drive it away

2051,182412788,Wanda Harris,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,5w,As mentioned earlier poison goes up the food chain and kills our fragile ecosystem. The little noise boxes work wonders so please purchase that.  Also many cats and dogs unfortunately end up at the vets because of rodent traps.  Please be kind to animals.(edited)
2052,182412788,Nora Kathy Beales,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,5 Apr,The more you feed them the more they come. A trap works best and fastest. If it goes on too long you will realize that they aren‚Äôt healthy to have around. They leave pee and feces everywhere and harbor disease. Best to get rid of them fast and for good. Plugs all entry ways also.
2053,182412788,Jill Woodford,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,5 Apr,I agree with the high frequency box. They have worked for us. This year the mice came again we replaced the boxes and haven‚Äôt seen any since.
2054,182412788,DONILYN WATLEY,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Apr,Wire srubbies with peanut butter pushed into the mesh. The mouse will chew on the wire to get to the PB and the wire shreds will kill it from the inside

2056,182412788,Linda R.,‚Ä¢ Five Points North,5 Apr,This is the one I have found most effective. Pay the extra $10 for the 2000 model. I have also found that one per floor or level of the house is plenty. Good luck!
2057,182412788,Joe Fritz,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Apr,"Someone may have mentioned this already, but sticky traps work great. Put them along your baseboards, especially in the kitchen or where food is. If you know where they are getting in, place them there as well. Only down side is you have to kill the mice after they get stuck to the trap. NO POISON! I had a cat die from eating a poisoned mouse."
2058,182412788,Deborah Baker,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Apr,"Glue traps are incredibly and unthinkably cruel.  The mice are in a literal state of panic and they either die in this state or as you said, you come and kill them after they have suffered.  Cruel.  Mice are mammals, are sentient beings.Find another method to kill them without such cruelty."
2059,182412788,Jason Allen,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,6 Apr,Sticky traps are inhumane.
2060,182412788,Diane Grove,‚Ä¢ Whittier,5 Apr,I agree with getting or borrowing a cat. We had a nest that my cat made short work of this winter. Killed three in 24 hours!
2061,182412788,Deborah Baker,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Apr,Just please oh please oh pleased not use glue traps!!  They are so cruel and are commonly used by exterminator companies.  De-con can be poisonous to the birds (like owls!!!) that will rat mice.  It is such a tricky problem.  The snap traps are least cruel but difficult to make them work right.  Good luck.
2062,182412788,Lynelle White,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 Apr,"Omg! Yes! Agree 100%!!! Those glue traps are horrible! I was sooo heartbroken to see the torture a mouse went through on one of those at my old job.

2071,172404863,Will M.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,18w,"Since the Federal Reserve Act our monetary system cannot run without debt. There can never be enough currency to pay back what is owed because Central Banks take a 6% cut, and because of interest owed on money borrowed. If we cut 100% of all spending and collected 100% of the money supply in taxes, we still couldn't pay off the debt. This is why the US Dollar was worth 26 times more in 1913 than it is today. Every time money is printed, the value of money in existence decreases. It's a form of stealth taxation and wealth redistribution that also pays Central Banks for doing nothing but creating ones and zeros in a bank processing system. The appeal is that it's easy money for politicians to spend, makes anyone close to the money creation richer, and it's very hard for the voting public to see or understand. Printing money and giving it to other countries is redistributing wealth from anyone who earns a living in USD or saves in it while paying other countries and Central Banks (who always get their cut).(edited)"

You do realize that when that happens, a McDonalds burger is going to cost $15, a soda will be $8, fries will be $10, a movie theater ticket will be $25. To raise minimum wage salaries for minimum wage workers puts everyone in jeopardy to ill afford even the simplest things in life. If you can‚Äôt afford to live on minimum wage jobs get an education or go to tech school. Minimum wage jobs were established for a reason.

There is a provision in this bill (from when it was raised to $12.80 in Jan 2020)  that allowed an exception for un-emancipated minors to make less, if the business (such as part time seasonal work) was certified to offer some sort of life skill. However, the process to qualify a business as such did not, and to my understanding still does not exist. So there really is no exception despite the law mandating one. I have reached out to many people on this issue for close to a year now with no answer as to when businesses can be certified, because again, the process doesn‚Äôt exist.

A 2x4 across the entire french door opening sitting in brackets on either side is a good way to secure french doors.  Also use sturdy wood pieces to block windows from being opened.  Measure what you need such as your dining room window and Home Depot will cut the wood for you. Take care.

I moved to Denver from Canada and it took me a long time to make friends. What I learned in that experience is people mean well. They are so jammed with obligations already, they are reluctant to invest time in a new friendship. I was guilty of this in Toronto. I grew up there and had a dozen friendships I couldn‚Äôt nurture the way I wanted to because of kids and family obligations.  It took me about two years to begin to feel settled in Denver and find people I genuinely connected with. Of course this is an extra challenge now."

2195,162206217,Michael Grosso,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,24 Sep,Pitbulls are the most lovable dogs ever. They are only mean if they have mean owners. Just like humans are born to love and learn but are then taught to hate and be racist. You can't label a breed

Wilbur Billingsley left his house at 20th Avenue and Emerson Street through a back alley on the way to pick up some groceries. His daughter, Michelle Billingsley, told Denverite that her mother started to worry when he didn‚Äôt promptly return. She poked her head into the alley and found him on the ground, badly bleeding and still being mauled by a neighbor‚Äôs pit bull. It had jumped over the fence to attack him."
2200,162206217,Jude Wolf,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Sep,"do you realize that all breeds of dog can bite? Pit bulls have consistently scored above average as friendly dogs with the American Temperament Test. You listing times when people have been attacked by pitbulls proves nothing, it gives no information about the circumstances, if the dogs has been abused or not if they had have been fixed or not. I could list times when golden retrievers have killed someone. Any dog is capable of the circumstances are right. It‚Äôs a scary thought, but that‚Äôs why it is crucial to pass this law so abusive owners are held accountable and the dogs that are actually dangerous, can be helped so the community isn‚Äôt at risk. It has been proved time and time again that breed specific legislation does nothing to keep the community safe. It has cost denver millions of dollars to uphold and it punishes responsible owners and innocent dogs. Please do some more research before listing pit bull attacks. The media has extremely skewed the way we see dog attacks, I highly recommend watching Beyond the Myth, it is very eye opening. If you really are advocating for the safety of the city against dog attacks, you should support breed neutral legislation and realize that over 50 breeds of dogs have been involved in fatal attacks in the past few years, and banning pitties is just a temporary solution to a larger issue or irresponsible owners and over population. Just like in humans, the way a dog looks or what their genetics are, determines nothing in regards to"
2201,162206217,Aszur Rollins,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,25 Sep,Pibbles are amazing! Thanks for posting this. I grew up with them and have had one (or two) my whole life. I truly hope people will open their hearts and lift this senseless ban.
2202,162206217,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,27 Sep,If you think people will follow the law and be responsible your as crazy as the world is

2204,162206217,Scott Hughes,‚Ä¢ Hale,28 Sep,"Twenty years ago the founder of the ""People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals"" organization, Ingrid Newkirk, wrote an opinion piece that was published about pit-bulls and it created quite a stir since she was in favor of bans. The official position of the PETA organization is in support of bans on the animals to this day. https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20000127-2000-01-27-0001270085-story.html"
2205,162206217,Davyd Smith,‚Ä¢ Skyland,28 Sep,"Yes.  PETA hates homeless pets.  They have one shelter and kill 90% of the pets that enter for the past decade. They are disliked by the majority of homeless pet advocates.  Newkirk is a crackpot, PETA is a cult."

They are constantly being bred and killed for no reason. People will backyard breed to make money and the dogs are often time abused and then we get pitties who feel like they need to protect themselves out of fear"
2207,162206217,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,1 Oct,She is not a puppy mill. She does not sell to just anyone. All of her dogs are under contract. No reflection . She is very specific on who her dogs go to and make sure They are well prepared for these dogs. Go out to your street look up-and-down the street and tell me how many people up-and-down your street should have these dogs. Every dog she is ever gotten rid of has been a forever home.
2208,162206217,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,4 Oct,"If 93% of all these dogs are killed. Wouldn't you think that statement , Would tell you, Not everybody should own one of these dogs"
2209,162206217,Scott Hughes,‚Ä¢ Hale,1 Oct,"It's been repeatedly asserted by the opponents of breed-specific legislation that the data has shown that there's no significant decrease in attacks with bans in place, but I'd like to point out that if there has been no notable increase either then that would still be a favorable outcome with all things considered. Statistics can be presented in misleading ways and that is evident here. I think there is ""confirmation bias"" present in the way that much of the available data was analyzed to start with and there are other parameters or circumstances (whether or not there was someone else there that could help, for example) to be taken into account for the information to be clarifying enough, considering what's at stake.

2213,184130356,Chap N.,‚Ä¢ Alamo Placita,21 Apr,This really becomes ideal if they will deliver fast food and snacks with it. One delivery is better for the environment and traffic.
2214,184130356,Laura W.,‚Ä¢ Sherrelwood,21 Apr,So many clutching their pearls this morning.   All the BS going on in the world and you're worried about weed being delivered......

Like why the heck would it bother people especially in times like this and it wasn‚Äôt disturbing anyone because it‚Äôs behind my fence on my drive so not even seen from the road .

2235,169993261,Roxie McKinster,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 Dec,I live close to the gate of Lowry at 11th & Yosemite.  I‚Äôve noticed there have been a couple campers & some tents just to the East of the gate.  Also there are a lot of campers parked in Lowry at Dayton & 11th.  Not sure if they have permission from Lowry or what.  Not sure who one would contact.
2236,169993261,Megan Weber,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,6 Dec,"I just ordered him a pair of bibbs and some wool socks, but they won‚Äôt be here until Dec 14. Katie Lindenberg I messaged you about how best to get to him once they arrive. Does Lilith have a coat and booties already? If not what kind of pup/approximate guesstimate on weight?"

2242,169785995,Jan Holland-Beachley,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,4 Dec,Completely agree with your observations! 
2243,169785995,Carol Neal,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,4 Dec,Agreed.
2244,169785995,Steve Paranawski,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,4 Dec,Which (indoor) public place are folks not wearing a mask at?
2245,169785995,Sheila D.,‚Ä¢ North Capitol Hill,5 Dec,Many
2246,169785995,Jan Holland-Beachley,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,4 Dec,Oh Steve...
2247,169785995,Matthew Wickstrom,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,4 Dec,"Pam,  I appreciate your overall concern for everyone‚Äôs health, however I think you‚Äôre misinformed about the use of masks outdoors and/or with members of your own household.  Per the CDC, masks are only necessary indoors, or outdoors when unable to maintain 6 feet or more distance for an extended period of time (not just passing by) with individuals not in your same household."
2248,169785995,Lindsay Lawson,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Dec,"Correct. It is greater than fifteen minutes within 6 feet. Masks are actually irrelevant according to the CDC in contact tracing. In fact, you could be a  wearing a mask with someone for fifteen minutes talking to your neighbor and are considered exposed because of the length of time spent inside a distance of 6 feet. Just a heads up. It‚Äôs all about distance and time. "
2249,169785995,JB Maroncelli,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,22w,I have cancer.....I walk around.....
2250,169785995,Steve Paranawski,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,5 Dec,I wish you well and may you have a full recovery. God Bless.
2251,169785995,Sheila D.,‚Ä¢ North Capitol Hill,5 Dec,"Me as well. I have cancer, addison's disease, a genetic clotting disorder, pernicious anemia, iron deficient anemia, and several others that although they don't cause me to be more immunocompromised make life difficult. I wear a mask for others. I hope they would do it for me. My son's FIL passed last week from covid-19.  He was in his mid 40's, healthy, and has 3 school age boys. Covid is not discriminatory. Anyone can get it and give it. "
2252,169785995,Vernon Schreiner,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,5 Dec,"I was given the gift of life by receiving a heart transplant and I am so grateful to my donor.  Thank all of you who wear a mask because you protect me AND you!  For those who may not wear a mask, please do not put me at risk, yourself or your loved ones.  Let‚Äôs all do the right thing and wear masks until we can get through this.  Be safe!"
2253,169785995,Gavin Trahan,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,5 Dec,"Uhhhh NO. You wanna not breath fresh air, thats on you. Don't push masks on people outside."
2254,169785995,Carol Neal,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,5 Dec,üò¶
2255,169785995,Laura Ellerby,‚Ä¢ City Park West,5 Dec,I wish that the joggers and cyclists who hog the walking paths in our parks would wear masks! There is no way to put 6 feet between someone who is huffing and puffing on a path without a mask and anyone else on the path. This is a BIG problem in City Park. Wear your masks or don‚Äôt expect to share the walking paths with others!
2256,169785995,Rowan Lyra,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Dec,"Kayla Gulf I can't believe that you posted this 5 hours ago and no one has pointed out that attacking passerbys with your hose isn't the thing to do.  You could literally be charged with assault, endangering public safety, and who knows what else. Hosing down a complete stranger, outside, in the cold winter air, who is doing something that you don't agree with, but it is well within their right to do?   'd cool it with hose if I were you, before someone gets really hurt (including yourself)."
2257,169785995,Blair B.,‚Ä¢ North Capitol Hill,22w,"I think there‚Äôs still confusion about the guidelines for outdoor mask-wearing. Before none of the guidelines included wearing a mask outside but then the local guidelines changed about a month or so ago. My understanding of the local guidelines now is that if you are in an outdoor space totally alone (with no one else around) or with your quarantine bubble you don‚Äôt have to wear a mask. But if anyone else is relatively close by you should wear a mask.  A lot of people just don‚Äôt like being inconvenienced to wear a mask, though. üò∑"
2258,169785995,Blair B.,‚Ä¢ North Capitol Hill,5 Dec,"Kayla Gulf I think sidewalks would definitely be in the within 6 feet category. They‚Äôre not very wide, as you say. I do think people should wear masks on the sidewalks outdoors. I agree with you about being very cautious about this all. I‚Äôve been generally wearing my mask outdoors ever since this all began. In my opinion one can‚Äôt be too cautious.  My point before about the changing regulations for mask-wearing is that I don‚Äôt think everyone is blatantly trying to challenge the guidelines and policies about wearing them. A lot of people are confused about what the guidelines are now."
2259,169785995,Steve Paranawski,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,5 Dec,For what it‚Äôs worth here is CO‚Äôs official position regarding wearing a mask üò∑ outside - stay safe.
2260,169785995,Blair B.,‚Ä¢ North Capitol Hill,5 Dec,So 6 feet away is the dividing line between no mask and mask. That makes sense!
2261,169785995,Gail Simon,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 Dec,"Kayla Gulf Well, yes it does, but you be you."
2262,169785995,Lisa Del,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,5 Dec,I run in wash park several times a week and have to stop myself from yelling at the throngs of people mask-less. It‚Äôs infuriating!
2263,169785995,Cynthia Swanson,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,5 Dec,"I've stopped running in the park for this exact reason. It's just too crowded, and dodging people unnerves me and makes the run significantly less enjoyable. I run to de-stress, not get more stressed out! The only solution I've found is to avoid the park and other crowded places. I miss running in Wash Park, but it is what it is."
2264,169785995,Sri Viswanath,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,5 Dec,Robin Wells yes I‚Äôve stopped running in Cheesman for the same reason . I do the split on 7th and also walk my dog their. Both times with mask
2265,169785995,Nicole Ryan,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Dec,I do not wear a mask outside and I won‚Äôt. Not unless I‚Äôm around people for more than 30 seconds passing them
2266,169785995,Gail Simon,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 Dec,"So, you're saying you don't care about anyone but yourself? Do you know there are virus ""shedders""? People who have no symptoms of COVID 19, but share the virus wherever they go? Think of Typhoid Mary and what happened to her!!!"
2267,169785995,Beverly Don,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,5 Dec,Masks are not required or needed outside ... but I put one on when I am approaching and passing someone.
2268,169785995,Gail Simon,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 Dec,"That's not good enough. The virus particles can hang in the air after you're gone. Please, wear a mask all the time! Thank from all of us!"
2269,169785995,JB Maroncelli,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 Dec,"caring for one another should not be a debate.....*IF* you care for others, wear a mask....."
2270,169785995,Mark Ryan,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,5 Dec,"This gets to the core of the mask issue problem. It is taking over as the 2020 version of ‚Äúhate has no home here‚Äú virtue signaling.  It has been made abundantly clear that masks are not needed outside, except in certain circumstances that almost are never met. They surely are not met by strangers passing each other. But for some reason some people here want to take the unscientifically supported position that masks matter when we are all out walking.  Also if you have a number of conditions that make you susceptible to Covid, don‚Äôt go anywhere. Stay home. It‚Äôs your life you‚Äôre responsible for it. Between all of the online ship to home, and the curbside pick up, you can go for months without having to get within 6 feet of another individual. But then again you wouldn‚Äôt be able to complain then."
2271,169785995,Drew M.,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,5 Dec,"In hopes that it‚Äôll make you feel better...in a Colorado Public Radio interview the head of CDPHE said you don‚Äôt need to wear a mask when walking on the 16th Street Mall, as an example."
2272,169785995,Blair B.,‚Ä¢ North Capitol Hill,5 Dec,"that‚Äôs so interesting! I wonder if that example still applies during busier times on 16th street mall, such as many people there doing Christmas shopping."
2273,169785995,Mary Kelly,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,5 Dec,"We are doing this out of love for others, even others we have never met, not for ourselves. For my nephew who has a double lung transplant because he has cystic fibrosis, for my friend who has a lobe of her lung missing and a chronic lung disease, for my cousin whose coworker in the hospital contracted Covid from a patient, brought it home to her husband and daughter who then both passed away. Do this out of your love for other people, people you may never know. Don‚Äôt do it for yourself."
2274,169785995,Stephanie Subramanian,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 Dec,Useful infographic included in an article in today's NYT
2275,169785995,Blair B.,‚Ä¢ North Capitol Hill,5 Dec,How interesting! I hadn‚Äôt seen that.
2276,169785995,Kathleen Laub,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,5 Dec,"Couldn't agree more.  I walk Washington Park and the majority of people walking, running, biking are  still without a mask.  I am protecting THEM wearing my mask, I wish they would be interested in protecting others."
2277,169785995,Mike Lewis,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,5 Dec,"Not disagreeing with you, but then why do you insist on still going there if that's our reality?  I wear and advocate for masks all of the time, but they ain't gonna 100% protect you, so...."
2278,169785995,Jana McSwain,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,5 Dec,It doesn't make me feel any better! Dr. Fauci says wear the mask when outside of your home.

2335,182395377,Michelle Birchby,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,4 Apr,Instead of using packing peanuts or glass bottles but some big plastic planting pots and turn them upside down in your pots. That way less soil is required and you can move the pots around much easier.
2336,182395377,Caroline Good,‚Ä¢ City Park West,7 Apr,This is what I do too!
2337,182395377,Nancy Ulrich,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,4 Apr,"I second country fair, on Quebec just south of Letsdale. "
2338,182395377,Raquel Aiken,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 Apr,Agree. I know the owners at County Fair. Great people!!!
2339,182395377,Jenny Bock,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,4 Apr,I‚Äôve had styrofoam peanuts in my pots for several years with no trouble. They sure are lighter to lift. Maybe you need to make sure you cover them with enough dirt‚Äîat least 4-5 inches so there's plenty of room for roots to grow. I use them only in my big pots. Nick's out on Iliff and Chambers is wonderful. Their selection is phenomenal!
2340,182395377,Elisa Reid,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,4 Apr,Use newspapers or cardboard in your pots vs peanuts
2341,182395377,Terry Sipes,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,4 Apr,"Do you get any shade from trees or buildings across the street from the hot west sun? If there are trees think leaf cover as none yet. What kind of color are you looking for? Annuals or perennials? Do you have a drip irrigation system to your pot locations or hand watering? There is a list of questions, just think through them, you will be fine. There are several good nursery‚Äôs around town, don‚Äôt plant in pots above ground until after Mother‚Äôs Day would be my suggestion, plenty of time to scope things out. ATS-Denver"
2342,182395377,Sue Bertram,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,5 Apr,Depending on the size of your pots empty beverage cans and/or empty plastic bottles with the lid on work well. I‚Äôm not a fan of styrofoam peanuts.
2343,182395377,Terry Sipes,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,5 Apr,"Not sure what size your pots will be or how close to the street alley they will be located remember the sneak thieves, thinking a good amount of dirt will make it harder for them to steal your gardening  efforts. ATS-Denver"
2344,182395377,Drusilla R.,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,5 Apr,"Plantings on west side...full sun or shade? This makes a difference in watering as temps later on will be much hotter. And sadly, thieves tend to seek out and snatch your potted beauties from porches or steps. Has been happening in recent summers in my townhome complex."
2345,182395377,Raquel Aiken,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5w,Plant hardy flowers that can withstand the heat. Geraniums can withstand heat and come in all colors. Add ivy and other greens to hang off the planter. Marigolds like heat too and come in bright yellow and orange. I would also keep flowers in planters‚Äîsince we do get hail here and this way you can easily rescue them! Hanging baskets are a great option too if you have a porch or deck. Happy Planting! üå∫üåª(edited)
2346,182395377,Leah B.,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,5 Apr,Geraniums help with the Japanese beetle problem too! I put them everywhere
2347,182395377,Jennifer Delacruz,‚Ä¢ Central Park,5 Apr,Leah Benner Thanks for that info! I did not know that. Geraniums going on my purchase list for this spring!
2348,182395377,Chad A.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Apr,"As far as pots go, I put rocks at the bottom. Mainly because I have some extra gravel/flagstone pieces on my property but it helped with using less soil, helped with drainage to prevent root rot, and makes the pots heavy so less likely to get stolen. I‚Äôm a fan of Perennials so that I don‚Äôt have to replant every year, but sometimes annuals make sense for pots/flower boxes. Good luck!"
2349,182395377,Dianna F.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,5 Apr,"I recommend using only perennials in the flower beds, they come back every year and get bigger and better each year.  For flowers beds I use grass plants in the back and some in front with a mixture of flowers.  My favorite place is Nick's Garden Center on Chambers, really nice selection and very healthy plants.  They usually have some pots already made that you can buy or duplicate if you see something you like.  For my pots I like to put a grass plant in the middle and plant the flowers around with some potato vine (comes in lime or brown) or some kind of vine you like.  Happy planting."
2350,182395377,Chris opi,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,5 Apr,Nicks is my favorite since they have a huge variety and parking. I can find things there that are unavailable elsewhere
2351,182395377,Diana Crew,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,5 Apr,Use colorful geraniums with a mix of things like petunias amd marigold for pots... city floral also has hanging planters ( expensive) Pete‚Äôs grocery and Home Depot. Don‚Äôt plant until after Mother‚Äôs Day!!!peonies produce nice blooms as well and are perennials for your front.
2352,182395377,Mary Gallagher,‚Ä¢ South Hilltop,5 Apr,"Denver Botanic Gardens is a fabulous resource! It's one of the best Botanic Gardens in the US. Their big plant sale is coming up - maybe starts the 25th? It's on line this year cuz of the virus, but they sell plants they've grown themselves. "
2353,182395377,Barbara Smith,‚Ä¢ Lowry,5w,"Bloem Ups a Daisy. disks for large pots.   You can buy these disks in various sizes to place in large pots.  They are disks that fit in the pots at the level you desire then fill the pot with soil, great at preventing root rot.  You can buy them at most nursery places but Amazon is cheapest.(edited)"
2354,182395377,Mary Fabrikant,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,5 Apr,"My peonies do GREAT on the west side of my house. showy, big blooms, great as cit flowers and to leave on the bush. So many colors to choose from and they come back reliably year after year after year. Very rewarding."

2362,179545110,April Link,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Mar,I‚Äôve been running through the Walmart‚Äôs again and those their at 1 am are gone; but I haven‚Äôt done them all.  There is a FB group called COVID Vaccine Hunters for CO.  Excellent resource and people actually finding them for you.  I found a drive through clinic in Thornton for Thursday on there last night.  I‚Äôm scheduled and once I get it for sure will be cancelling my Saturday appt at the i70 and Tower Walmart
2363,179545110,April Link,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Mar,"Also, Walgreens has a very wonky scheduling system that has been full of glitches since launch.  People in CO have been walking into some Walgreens and able to get vaccinated because of their system not allowing to just schedule the first dose without scheduling second at same time that aren‚Äôt loaded or available for scheduling.  Three people were able to do this yesterday."
2364,179545110,Amanda Sanford,‚Ä¢ Lowry,9 Mar,I went through Kaiser as a non-member and got one this past weekend.
2365,179545110,Barbara Smith,‚Ä¢ Lowry,9 Mar,"A friend got one through the Thornton Fire department. UC@ Anschutz has a patient portal, you do not have to be a patient to sign up."
2366,179545110,Susan Lee,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Mar,"A friend sent me this website. Sometimes it‚Äôs useful, sometimes the vaccine locations get blocked. But, using this and then going to the provider website directly, I was able to get my husband his vaccine.  You need to be diligent... just because they have no vaccines at 9 am. Doesn‚Äôt mean that more won‚Äôt show up at that same location later in the day.   "
2367,179545110,Lisa Talucci,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Mar,"Kaiser, health one, Centura, UCH, your own doctor, pharmacies. Dr B is a new site that matches people with vaccines that were not claimed or used before they expire."

2369,179545110,Chuck Poppe,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,9 Mar,Signed up for vaccine clinic at Brookfield Public Health last night.  Shot tomorrow. They had open slots.

2373,179545110,Shelley Tamminga,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,9 Mar,Try King Soopers and be willing to go to any store that shows appointments.  We got ours in Brighton.

2376,167326664,Sydney Stone,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,9 Nov,"A few weeks ago, a guy in your situation found his bike at a homeless encampment..and he paid the thieving loser $160 to get it back.  Seems very enabling to me--why didn't he just take the bike and say FU? Would he be charged with stealing his own property?"
2377,167326664,Dan Hernandez,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,9 Nov,Sorry for the loss. Never use cables. I had to learn that the hard way too.
2378,185453322,Jennifer Steck,‚Ä¢ Lowry,2 May,"This is unacceptable. We have approximately the same number of officers that we had in 2008 when we had under 500,000 residents. We no longer see officers in our neighborhoods, just photo radar vans and trailers showing driving speeds. At some point, we need actual officers who patrol our neighborhoods. How can we have community policing without officers who actually work regularly in our communities? I‚Äôm sorry this happened Stan. So scary."
2379,185453322,Patty Moody,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 May,You are exactly right!
2380,185453322,Stan Smith,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,2 May,"Our neighborhood now belong to the bad guys, they know the police and 911 ability has deminished!"
2381,185453322,Andy Selig,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 May,"Yes, totally unacceptable. I think the mayors office needs to hear from all of us about things like this. There needs to be more support of we citizens compared to everything he does for real estate developers"

2385,185453322,Marcia Kayhanfar,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,2 May,Good idea
2386,185453322,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 May,I was on the 16th st mall last night and didn‚Äôt see a single cop. Usually this is well patrolled. Did see several derelicts and open drug use. Glad so many people want less cops protecting ‚Ä¶ ops not protecting us
2387,185453322,Katherine Carrara,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,2 May,Richard Boehm I do think this is in retaliation to defund the police. No one wants it gone just not a military force shooting people. There's no in-between it seems.
2388,185453322,Jonathan Bryant,‚Ä¢ Central Park,2 May,"You stated they tried a couple of times to back up and escape - does that mean that they were apprehended, Stan?  Hope so."
2389,185453322,Cristin Cochran,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,2 May,"Stan, so sorry. Cristin"
2390,185453322,Monique Gomez,‚Ä¢ Hale,2 May,"They don‚Äôt care. My car was stolen in the neighborhood in a gated garage!

It‚Äôs been a week and no one has been in contact with me and when I call they seem clueless on what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs ridiculous and they don‚Äôt care about anything apparently. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you."
2391,185453322,mike niemann,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,2 May,Now a response that confirms the current stare of affairs....
2392,185453322,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 May,"Read that there was i believe 354 car thefts in 2019, 6578 in 2020 and 6669 in just the first 3 months of 2021. Welcome to the new reality of Denver."
2393,185453322,April Link,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,2 May,In 2019 that was probably a monthly average.. Denver has been in the top 20 for auto theft for years. But the numbers have skyrocketed from 2020 to this year for sure. With so many car thefts daily DPD can‚Äôt keep up and don‚Äôt do much about it
2394,185453322,Sarah Hexton,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,3 May,"Absolutely madness. That 6,000 plus doesn‚Äôt include attempted theft huh? I was around town and I noticed so many door lock cylinders are missing on older cars. I hate that Denver is like this."
2395,185453322,Chris Merman,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,2 May,So sorry this is happening. Elections have consequences. Vote.
2396,185453322,Gretchen Koehler,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,2 May,Also we need to change the rules on how ballot measures are written for voters.  They use misleading language and double negatives so that people think they are voting one way but are actually voting opposite their intention.  Another issue for another Post.
2397,185453322,James Love,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 May,So defunding the police was a bad idea? Who would of thought

2407,185453322,Brian Souders,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,2 May,"With reduction in effective police support, we can expect many issues with trying to receive the same protection as in the past. Too many shootings and murders receive the priority support."
2408,185453322,Joy Cash,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 May,"I am not interested in reducing our police force...just interested in keeping  any knees off NECkS  and by NOT being shot when moving away from the officers. Judgement/knowledge enters here, of course.  Chasing a violent criminal or petty thief ?"
2409,185453322,Jason Evitt,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,2 May,"That is, on it's face, not what ""defunding"" means.  If that's all people want, they should come up with an accurate description and stop demonizing cops."

As long as police do these things and cover them up, shoot people in the back, put knees on necks, etc., they will have a trust and credibility problem. Their culture needs to change decades ago."

I forget the name of the park but it is on the way to a friend's house - the park went from having children and families in it to being full of tents and trash, full of people visibly not sober. Its a sad situation all around"
2454,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,34w,"No i get it, its sad for everyone. The thing with the shelters is that to sleep there you have to be sober and a lot of homeless have addiction problems."

2456,160715261,Katy Allen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Sep,I would prefer we quit saying ‚Äúthe homeless‚Äù. It‚Äôs kinda dehumanizing. Also we don‚Äôt know all this crime is from ‚Äúthe homeless‚Äù. I have been following crime for about ten Years in park hill and this isn‚Äôt new. It is sad that a lot of safe havens and shelters have closed during COVID too so people are just trying to survive. No I do not approve of crime but I really think there are systemic problems contributing to this.
2457,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,10 Sep,"Not trying to start an argument, genuinely asking, what phrase would be preferable?"
2458,160715261,Katy Allen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Sep,Thanks for your wonderful conversation....not being sarcastic at all. I enjoy this respectful conversation. As neighbors we don‚Äôt have to agree but I enjoy learning from each other. Here is an article I http://humilityofmaryshelter.com/shelter-uses-person-first-language/
2459,160715261,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,34w,Wonderful article!  You have taught me so much!  Thank you!  I believe words are important.  Great question.(edited)
2460,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,12 Sep,"I'll agree to disagree here. It makes no sense to me, both phrases mean the same thing.  For example, calling me a Mexican person is exactly the same as calling me a person of Mexican heritage."
2461,160715261,Katy Allen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,12 Sep,I think it is important to ask people what phrasing feels right to them so makes sense to me! Most of the literature shows that there is less discrimination that occurs when people use person first language but you always get to identify the way it feel right to you.
2462,160715261,Katy Allen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,34w,Also if you read about mental health there is a strong push not to call people a schizophrenic or bipolar. It is better to say a person with schizophrenia so the persons mental health isn‚Äôt the focus but the focus is they as people.(edited)
2463,160715261,Katy Allen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,34w,Also homelessness and mental health are not the same concepts as race/ethnicity but I think it‚Äôs important to refer to people the way they want to be referred to so glad you said that. Some people would say race and ethnicity are core aspects of identity where having a home and/or mental illness are not(edited)
2464,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,12 Sep,"Also let me just add , I love that this thread is continually a civil sharing of insights and opinions. Too often on Next Door have threads like these completely imploded, with people stooping to insults and name calling. A refreshing change of pace!"

2467,160715261,Arlene Hetherington,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Sep,"I've noticed a street full of dilapidated campers and some tents north of Smith road, with lots of garbage accumulated in the area.  It looks like these people are trying to bag up some of the garbage but of course there is no waste disposal pickup so the piles of trash keep growing."
2468,160715261,Nicole H.L.,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,16 Sep,We should keep in mind that police are often not the best people to bring into these situations.  Asking for a social worker or emts only would be a way to proceed in the future.
2469,160715261,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,16 Sep,"Unfortunately the homeless outreach officers were unable to respond for an estimate of 2 months when we contacted them for an encampment that settled behind our home, across our alley."

2471,160715261,Brett Matens,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Sep,"All: I apologize if I used any inappropriate terminology in my post. I‚Äôm just reading through all of the interaction. Experiencing homelessness is not a defining characteristic of others nor is it appropriate to  define mental health without the right terminology or without a professional opinion.   My post was merely an FYI to neighbors and those were my original thoughts of how to describe the situation (his actions, sleeping bag, etc).  I see this as a forum to keep each other educated and informed."

2496,184960211,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,27 Apr,Please stop with these posts. You have no idea how incredibly expensive it is to rent/buy in Denver. 5 unrelated/related people in one house should be allowed and is of no concern to you.
2497,184960211,Tracy Shaffer,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,27 Apr,"Communal living is the future. My son and three responsible roommates had a heck of a time finding a place to live when it was no more than 3 and with rents what they are, the 4th person made is affordable for all, and protected all of them in case someone had to move.  I'm all in favor of the raise from 3 to 5 unrelated persons. I just moved from one part of PH to another and the neighbors always park in front of my house leaving no where for my visitors, which is a bit annoying. I have a garage for my car, I feel it's a little selfish to ask a neighbor to leave an empty space, it's the reality of city living."

2501,160507608,Marguerite Korber,‚Ä¢ Hudson Street,6 Sep,"Yes, the city workers now have to pick them up when they are cutting the grass! I am fine if they don‚Äôt put the trash cans back as they are very very smelly in the heat. People simply need to pick up the poop and dispose of it in their trash cans. Be a responsible dog owner"
2502,160507608,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,6 Sep,"That's just gross. Why do people think ""hey, a can USED to be here, so I can still leave poop bags here""?! What is seriously going through their head?"
2503,160507608,Robert Moreno,‚Ä¢ Hale,6 Sep,....straight up laziness.
2504,160507608,Anna ValentineParker,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 Sep,The trash cans have been removed on 17th Ave Pkwy as well. We need to clean up after our own selves...adapt.
2505,160507608,Carol Emrick,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Sep,I would like the trash cans to be brought back. I always use them and don't leave dog poop bags on anyone's property. People are throwing their trash daily in the parkway and I usually pick up that and put it in the trash cans in the parkway. I really appreciate the care that goes into our park ways and I would pay a bit more to have the trash cans returned.
2506,160507608,Katie Fogarty,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,6 Sep,"Same thing happens by the bus stops... where trash cans also used to be.  It‚Äôs quite strange behavior.  I can only assume that these are our neighbors (with the dog poop) so if you see it, say something.  Maybe they assume trash cans are coming back soon?  They are not."
2507,160507608,Dianne Meyerson,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,6 Sep,It is disgusting
2508,160507608,Wanda Harris,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,6 Sep,When trash cans in NYC were removed-  dog walkers did the same thing and soon thereafter it took less than 2 weeks for normal trash cans to be returned.
2509,160507608,Elaine Taniwaki,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 Sep,So it must be New Yorkers leaving their dogs' poop in this pile... :)
2510,160507608,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,6 Sep,Well that's one way to stage a silent protest.
2511,160507608,Wanda Harris,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,34w,If you believe that decreasing trash cans is a bad situation please

If you are doing this, please stop. It's not advancing your cause and it's very unpleasant for the rest of us."
2516,160507608,Mary Jo Hartwell,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,6 Sep,"Also, pick it up if you are walking.  I had to pick up 3 piles today"
2517,160507608,Joyce Cerretti,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,6 Sep,City reduction in staff to pickup trash.
2518,160507608,Cathy Van Blerkom,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,6 Sep,Are these the same people leaving poop bags along mountain trails? Maybe they believe in ‚Äúpoop fairies‚Äù who clean up after them. Own your poop bags people!!
2519,160507608,Michele DB,‚Ä¢ Lowry,10 Sep,They sure do. See it up there on hikes all the time. üëéüèª
2520,160507608,Jan Smedley,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,6 Sep,"I understand the silent protest, but this is disgusting. Please carry your waste and dispose of it appropriately."
2521,160507608,Joanne Davidson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,7 Sep,Exactly! How much effort does it take to carry your dog's bag of poop home to dispose of in your own trash can?
2522,160507608,Richard Robb,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,6 Sep,"We curate the sponsored RTD trash can at the corner of 12th and Monaco, in our fron yard. This is not a city dump. It is for bus riders to dispose of their personal trash before boarding. Please do not put your dog poop here, as we empty this into our personal trash bin. We are doing our best to be good neighbors and citizens by reducing litter in Montclair/Mayfair. Take your poop home for disposal, as we always did with our dog. It is disgusting to empty pounds of dog poop weekly from this trash can. Thank you for cleaning up after your dog, but please dispose of it it in your own trash receptacle Thanks and peace out.."

2524,160507608,Anne Delphia,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,7 Sep,Maybe you tell Amanda Sawyer for some reason she doesn‚Äôt think dog poop is trash.
2525,160507608,Joanne Davidson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,7 Sep,Amanda Sawyer has queried the city re: why the trash cans were removed and was told that staff/$$ shortages caused their removal.
2526,160507608,Christopher Neuman,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,8 Sep,"This seems to be a Colorado thing, never seen it before moving here but it seems like dog owners have the opinion that once it is bagged their job ends, I see this everywhere including lots of trails around the state, people bag and leave it, maybe they were going to get it on the way back, but that‚Äôs just the optimist in me talking I suppose."
2527,160507608,Suzi Scher,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,8 Sep,"Gosh, that is not good.  Everyone, take your dog‚Äôs poop to the trash, every time..."

2532,178013703,Patrick Hughes,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,23 Feb,Go up to auto zone on colfax and get the club they have several reasonable models under 50 dollars. After they stole my truck I did that and put a disconnect module in fuse box that disables the ignition unless you have a special key fab with you in the truck.

2537,178013703,Chris Wilson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,23 Feb,"They probably have bolt cutters, so a chain might not do much.  Disconnect the battery and remove it. Also pull out the spark plug wires, then they‚Äôll have to push it if they really want it."
2538,178013703,Carol Martin,‚Ä¢ City Park West,23 Feb,CW..Most people aren‚Äôt familiar with the firing order of their distributors which is why I wouldn‚Äôt recommend removing spark plug wires.
2539,178013703,Carol Martin,‚Ä¢ City Park West,23 Feb,"The coil wire is quickest to remove that can be replaced quickly for each trip, at least until some sort of kill switch is installed."

This is Denver and Denver City Council once again abdicating their responsibilities for corrections and dumping it on the community to resolve.  Im not exactly sue why we even have a city council.  It has become as corrupt as Washington DC."

2563,154753901,Jessica Day,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,14 Jul,Candace Sake We also have it in our yard/sidewalk in Hilltop.  The workers who installed it said it was internet for the school. Didn‚Äôt realize it was 5G...

2569,154753901,Candace Sake,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Jul,Great idea. Working on that now. Thank you!
2570,154753901,Steve Whatley,‚Ä¢ Hale,13 Jul,"Put one in our front hellstrip as well. No advance warning at all.  Verizon's contract is with the state of Colorado, not the city, though they will claim that this is city property.  Soon you'll have a shiny new cell tower in your front yard to go with it. Sadly, no one has had any luck fighting any of this."
2571,154753901,Sara Freeman,‚Ä¢ Hale,13 Jul,They have contracts with every city that is approved for the small cell towers. All carriers are doing this and approved for towers. I worked when the agreements got approved for these cell towers. They are in most all major cities.

2575,154753901,Cynthia Ivers,‚Ä¢ Lowry,13 Jul,Candace Sake it seems they almost have free reign with an easement. I think the only requirement is they clean up the mess they made.
2576,154753901,Sara Freeman,‚Ä¢ Hale,13 Jul,"Candace, I worked for Verizon in the 5G department and many poles have gone up over the past couple years. All of the sites are in the right of way which is owned by the city of Denver. It‚Äôs very unfortunate because they have been in residential area in front. Of home owners. But the areas are approved by the city and they make sure they aren‚Äôt on property lines. There has been several lawsuits filed by residents against the city for these poles , but I don‚Äôt think residents will win the war on it. Since it is the city‚Äôs property technically.

2578,154753901,Anne Culver,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,13 Jul,"The problem of getting ANYONE to answer the phone has never been worse than it is now: the city, Sears Repair Service for starters, and the booby prize goes to VERIZON. This is partly Pandemic, I realize, but the increasing difficulty of any communication that isn‚Äôt between machines is starting to get scary!"
2579,154753901,Candace Sake,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Jul,Agreed! We have been diplomatic and yet still can‚Äôt get anyone to pick up the phone. I think that‚Äôs been the worst part.
2580,154753901,William Bueche,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Jul,"There may be another one a couple blocks up 10th at 1000 Locust too. I have not confirmed it, but there had been a large concrete box sitting in their yard just beside the sidewalk (by the stop sign) for a few days. I thought to myself how rude of the city to place something on a private lawn like that - but I assumed it was maybe a temporary storage container. And then one day it was gone - but it did not occur to me until I saw your note that it may have been buried. If it is another one, then I guess we can expect 5G towers every couple blocks? Ridiculous effort for what will surely be a fad that vanishes as soon as the next technology arrives."
2581,154753901,Candace Sake,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Jul,"Yah, It sounds like the folks up the street have also been affected. "
2582,154753901,John Bradley,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,43w,Dig it up and take it back to Verizon.. lol!(edited)
2583,154753901,Candace Sake,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Jul,I genuinely have thought about that! Haha.
2584,154753901,Emily Gordon,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,43w,"Maybe you have already seen this article, since it is old. But it sounds like there is no ""recourse"" so to speak, for homeowners. https://www.denverpost.com/2019/10/07/denver-cell-poles-verizion-berkeley/(edited)"
2585,154753901,Candace Sake,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Jul,"Appreciate you passing the article along! I will say, it is terrifying to see a picture of what this pole is going to look like. It‚Äôs going to dwarf the poor house."

2587,154753901,Candace Sake,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Jul,OOoo the map gives me some hope! It doesn‚Äôt look they have a giant pole planned? Hard to say. The guy this morning said to prep for a large pole. 
2588,154753901,Candace Sake,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Jul,"I‚Äôm not entirely sure, but does this qualify as easement rather than public right of way since it‚Äôs in our yard rather than in between a sidewalk and the street?"
2589,154753901,Russ Hathaway,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,13 Jul,That is public Right if way. The city owns 6‚Äô from the street.

2594,154753901,Candace Sake,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Jul,Those sure would have been helpful. I think we would have passed on the corner lot had we have known.
2595,154753901,Mark Ryan,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,14 Jul,Candace Sake what is so bad about corner lots?  The mega walkways they put in now?
2596,154753901,Stephanie Sato,‚Ä¢ Hale,43w,Very concerning and unfortunate.  I am noticeably sensitive to RFs.  Not healthy for anyone.  At *very least* those residing in close proximity are informed in advance.(edited)
2597,154753901,Candace Sake,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Jul,Totally agree. I work with a brilliant technologist and this was his advice.
2598,154753901,Jan Delsi,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,13 Jul,I would be concerned about being that close to that type of technology and any long term health hazards.
2599,154753901,Candace Sake,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Jul,We absolutely agree with you. Corporations don‚Äôt have a good track record of looking out for consumers. We are bummed about being forced to be their guinea pigs.
2600,154753901,Cathie Lopez,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,13 Jul,"Not sure where this is in your yard, however, there is an easement on every property that can and may be used for utilities.  Definately call the City or Verizon."

2602,154753901,Colleen Kazemi,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Jul,Candace Sake They were marking water lines in our street to install one of these today. We're at 25th and Leyden. Please let us know what you find out. Would love to see where/when/what is going in.
2603,154753901,Randy McQueen,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Jul,Be sure to read your home sale closing documents (inclusive of the easement access you have already granted) before you spend any $.
2604,154753901,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Jul,"True, easement info might be in there but a survey is much better. Like they say, one picture is worth 1000 words and the legal description of an easement will talk about survey points and degrees of turn. It's hard to understand those even if you know what they're talking about."

2607,159100582,Clare Canny,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,25 Aug,"I bought it in the midst of my divorce.  I literally put myself back together on that bike.  Although I had upgraded my bike , I kept it because it meant so much to me."
2608,159100582,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,29 Sep,I was driving on 17th today and on the Southwest corner of City Park there is a homeless tent encampment.  I believe this bike was parked next to a tent.  It‚Äôs worth a look.
2609,158251366,Gwen Ross,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,Karen glad you‚Äôre both ok. Scary. Thanks for sending this out. Gwen
2610,158251366,Margere Weiss,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,16 Aug,So glad you are safe. So good to hear that the police responded quickly.

2612,158251366,Karen Kalfas,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,"In these days that question the actions of the police,  I have to say that our experience was of total efficiency and professionalism.   We were very impressed with how well they handled the situation, especially having an ambulance come to check the guy out, I have only words of praise for our police in this matter."
2613,158251366,Michele Padilla,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,16 Aug,You live in CCN and are probably white. Of course you had a great experience with DPD.
2614,158251366,Elizabeth Sawyer,‚Ä¢ Country Club,16 Aug,I‚Äôm so glad you and John are okay!  So scary.
2615,158251366,Janet Freese,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,What a shock that must have been! Glad you‚Äôre OK.
2616,158251366,Monique Fowler,‚Ä¢ Country Club,16 Aug,Can you provide more information about the Suspect? We live between 6-7th and Marion. A man followed my daughter around the block as she was walking our dog.  She first  noticed him sitting on our neighbors porch and he was saying very disturbing things like I‚Äôll see you in my grave. The next night a man tried to enter our house but when we opened the door he vanished we called the police. I believe he is of darker skin and wearing darker jeans. Any info would be helpful so that we can clear our minds that he isn‚Äôt still prowling around.
2617,158251366,Karen Kalfas,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,"This guy was probably around 5'10"", 20's, light brown skin, short cropped dark hair, dark pants, he wasn't wearing shoes or shirt,  was fairly muscular, clean and had a large gold colored wrist watch.   Hope this helps."
2618,158251366,Elaine Sample,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,16 Aug,I'm so sorry Karen.  That's scary.
2619,158251366,Ruth Starr,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,"Oh my, sounds frightening. Yay for the police, and your dog! Stay aware and thank you for posting."
2620,158251366,Melissa Winter,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,16 Aug,I'mm sorry to hear this and glad you are safe. Thanks for posting.
2621,158251366,Monique Fowler,‚Ä¢ Country Club,16 Aug,Thanks I think that‚Äôs the same guy. Do you think he‚Äôs in jail or do you think he‚Äôs out again. My daughter is 14 and Is freaked out by it all
2622,158251366,Karen Kalfas,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,"I couldn't say for sure, we haven't heard from the police, but I would think they have some grounds to hold him."
2623,158251366,Kathleen O'Brien,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,16 Aug,I saw a barefoot guy acting strange early this morning on Alameda near Monroe St.  But I assume your guy was in custody.  Maybe he has a twin.  üòè
2624,158251366,Hannah G.,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,16 Aug,"I live in Cherry Creek North as well, could you clarify whereabouts this occurred?"
2625,158251366,Karen Kalfas,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,5th and Fillmore
2626,158251366,Liza Anne S. DeJulio,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,Crime up in CCN in the last 5 months and higher than the last 3 years.  Neighborhood patrolling may be necessary if this continues even if residents may need to pay.
2627,158251366,Michael DeGrummond,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,The CCN commercial area has security who drive the streets at night. First to third and Steele to University. Seems they could expand that area. Would probably cost additional funding but living within the commercial boundaries makes me feel safer when I walk my dog after dark.
2628,158251366,Bobby Aardema,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,16 Aug,Our police are great! Glad you are ok.

2631,158251366,Kara Shirey,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,Get a gun.
2632,158251366,Frank Prokop,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,16 Aug,YES!!
2633,158251366,Jeff Carlisle-Tierno,‚Ä¢ Hale,12 Sep,"I‚Äôm a combat vet, Type 1 FFL licensee, and CCW holder. I‚Äôve used lethal force in the military and as a civilian (including in NOLA in the wake of Katrina and Rita) and have an assortment that would make the Everytown/MFL crowd lose their heads. Suffice to say I don‚Äôt oppose the idea, but it really irks me when people seem to think that simply strapping up turns them into Rambo. That‚Äôs not how it works, and if someone is convinced they couldn‚Äôt do it, there‚Äôs a pretty fair chance they‚Äôre right. Not to mention the need to make yourself proficient, to discipline yourself to be situationally aware, to understand that it should not only deter those who would wish you harm but also deter you from escalating situations, and so much more."
2634,158251366,gayle nichols,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,16 Aug,"poor fellow, probably very hungry and homeless."
2635,158251366,Kara Shirey,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,Yeah I‚Äôm sure he was just there to raid their pantry üôÑ
2636,158251366,Steve M.,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,16 Aug,We had someone on our porch in the middle of the winter around 1:30 to 2:00 am.  Police were great when they arrived but it took 20 minutes.  Definitely not a safe response time.
2637,158251366,Robin Pilling,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,16 Aug,When seconds matter you can count on the police in minutes. I love our men and women in blue but they can't be there instantly. Which is why I own a gun and have a ccw. Then you can dial 911 and report a shot suspect in your home.
2638,162282386,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,23 Sep,"I will of course post any response that I receive from Chris's office.  Teresa is Chris's senior assistant and has been responsive to me in the past on other community issues.  I would like to encourage other people in different districts to likewise reach out to their ""representatives"" to obtain answers on their positions on this issue."
2639,162282386,Dana Smart,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,23 Sep,"Thank you Sarah! I‚Äôm in complete agreement with your concern and discussed along with the lack of representation that we are receiving from Chris Hinds. I would like to know who he is speaking with and who he is truly representing because my neighbors are feeling the exact same way. This egregious proposal being shoved down our throat‚Äòs that doesn‚Äôt serve the residents living in this community needs to be stopped. Well we all understand that our city is growing and our needs are changing, this still does not justify all of these measures that have been poorly thought out, lack credible documented justification, and ignore the concerns of the residents who pay his salary!!"
2640,162282386,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,23 Sep,Thanks so much for your prompt response Teresa.  Your office has always been very responsive when I have reached out and I greatly appreciate that fact.  Unfortunately the public that responded to inquiry as to Chris‚Äô position on Nextdoor were incorrect.  That‚Äôs why posting Chris‚Äô position (or lack thereof at this point) set forth in your email is very helpful.
2641,162282386,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,23 Sep,"See Chris's office response to my email above received in less than 5 minutes of sending it to them.  I am relieved to hear that Chris is seeking more input!  Please note that as I said in response to Teresa's email, I have only had prompt and thoughtful responses from his office so please do not hesitate to contact him (teresa's email is attached to the top of her response) and make your opinion's known.  Also, I find Chris's ongoing newsletters extremely informative so definitely sign up for them if you have not done so already."
2642,162282386,Lisa Ramos,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,23 Sep,Here for all of it a written and hoping that Chris Hinds continues his support. The elitist fearmongers may be dominating the conversation but many of us support updating these rules to address the real needs in our community.
2643,162282386,Michael Ritter,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,23 Sep,I guess you don‚Äôt own a home then
2644,162282386,Linda Bash,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,23 Sep,Stop this!!
2645,162282386,Dean Bartell,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,32w,"I‚Äôm still not clear on what the expectation is from a survey considering there were already 4000 comments that are available for every City Council member to read. In addition, the Land, Use, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee (LUTI) met with Andrew Webb on September 1st and questioned him about the concerns regarding the proposal development process and the proposal in its current state. I have some of the transcript that contains the LUTI Committee‚Äôs valid questions, comments and the answers from Webb and other city officials. Every Councilperson has access to that full transcript. All of the same feedback was also shared, both pro and con, on the D10 Zoom meeting last week. Polling results about supporting or opposing it is meaningless if only a small percentage of 50,000 adults in D10 people respond. If polling would have that much weight in how a Councilperson would vote, then move it to a ballot initiative and let the voters speak directly. I don‚Äôt know one person that thinks that the current code is reasonable, but the 180 pendulum swing is not going to fly with the citizens in this city. There is a legal option that will be utilized by those opposed in more affluent and well organized neighborhoods which will be deployed to prevent it from happening in their neighborhoods. The result of that legal option will be counter to the theorized outcome of spreading this equally across all neighborhoods. Reasonably amending the proposal would likely prevent that legal option from happening.(edited)"
2646,162282386,Simon Lofts,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,23 Sep,"Hello Sara Henry,"
2647,162282386,Simon Lofts,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,23 Sep,Can you let me know in nutshell form what is being proposed and  why it is opposed.
2648,162282386,Ivan London,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,23 Sep,I strongly oppose the proposed Text Amendment.
2649,162282386,Simon Lofts,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,23 Sep,"Sir,"

2651,162282386,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,32w,My neighbors David. I didn't realize that it was my responsibility to canvas everyone in every neighborhood in order to state that the people with whom I've spoken are opposed. I did not say everyone in Denver is opposed. You're certainly welcome to voice your own opinion to your council member as I suggested everyone do.(edited)
2652,162282386,Bryan Downey,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,23 Sep,Complete agreement with post and have written Teresa/Chris many times.
2653,162282386,Courtney Sorensen,‚Ä¢ Hale,23 Sep,Consider this: the Apartment Association of CO wrote in their industry publication that new builds and planned new builds - in these city planing areas - WILL NOT MEET POPULATION GROWTH NATIONALLY.
2654,162282386,Dean Bartell,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,23 Sep,This is a perfect example of how the city doesn‚Äôt consider what‚Äôs reasonable in a civilized society. It is on the subject of bathrooms in their summary. The requirement is ONE bathroom whether there are 5 residents or 20. That should work out well during a health crisis.
2655,162282386,Lisa Ramos,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,23 Sep,Guaranteed housing is my idea of reasonable in a civilized society. This won't come close but if a few friends want to share a bathroom to keep the rent down then where is the harm?
2656,162282386,David Mintzer,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,23 Sep,"This thread is so bizarre. So far I‚Äôve been called a radical, pot smoking, real estate developer who spends all day playing video games in my basement and wants to ruin the neighborhood by allowing 30 felons to move in next door. Have a good night folks!"

2661,162282386,Dana Smart,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,24 Sep,What also continues to be lost is that our country is a Republic where our elected officials are in office to execute the desire and will of the people. Their job is not to decide and implement what they think we should have imposed upon us. The feedback from the people clearly shows that the present proposal doesn‚Äôt represent the majority of the people and their concerns.

2663,162282386,Chris Platt,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,32w,I'll consider supporting this when ALL neighborhoods are equally effected. No bullshit exemptions for certain neighborhoods (that just so happen to be where our mayor and some city council members live). I'm tired of our local government setting rules that they personally don't have to follow or deal with. It stinks of hypocrisy.(edited)
2664,162282386,Dean Bartell,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,24 Sep,"The reality is that it will never be equitably spread anyway since there are 900+ HOAs in the city and those are private Agreements between property owners and the HOA. Many HOAs have the number of residents per household in their covenants. If an HOA says max 1.5 residents per bedroom, the city cannot tell the HOA to increase the number. If they don‚Äôt amend this and make it less extreme, I suspect there will be more HOAs formed to control it within neighborhoods. That issue, along with the exempt parts of the city, make this a proposal that isn‚Äôt very effective at spreading a solution across neighborhoods."

Perhaps the cost estimate of 19 mil isn't for a purchase then, but for a renovation, certainly a kitchen and dining area, showers, toilets and sinks, I'm guessing for men & women, possibly even a separate area for married persons; then again, will it be a group environment as with a camp, or individual rooms?

2712,158601500,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,19 Aug,I wonder what oversight the city plans on having in place to know how the private contractor will be operating the facility in a couple of years.
2713,158601500,J. Scott F.,‚Ä¢ Beeler Park,20 Aug,"I think you read that wrong. The lease for the building will cost $19 million/year. (Warehouse space is very expensive in Denver these days, due to legalized marijuana.) There's no mention in the article of who will operate the shelter or how much that will cost. AFAIK, all existing shelters are operated by non-profits."

2715,158601500,Florence S.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,20 Aug,"The City owns the building. In fact, the purchase requisition stated ""Acquire space for use as an overflow shelter and general city storage."" "
2716,158601500,Darcy T.,‚Ä¢ Alamo Placita,20 Aug,My question exactly. We are being played like a fiddle with hanncock at the wheel.
2717,158601500,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,37w,"I bet that there has been a fear / concern that once the changes are made to the structure of the building, and the people are in, they'd have a permanent facility for homelessness on their hands, now we know at least as connected to a 10 year lease, and a catalyst for more; Denver, the magnet for the homeless and in need, they will all come for a visit, if you just plant the seed."

2719,158601500,Ami Webb,‚Ä¢ New Green Valley Ranch,20 Aug,Exactly.
2720,158601500,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,20 Aug,"This is good clarifying information.  In our age of social media, distrust of just about everybody holding some position of authority, at least insofar as honesty and being up front about mistakes and future plans, the city's media department ought to have considered providing this information to the public, as a service of information, to them (us all).  The homeless dilemma and the accompanying crime city wide are not a small issues, they have been steadily growing for a very long time, and despite being voted down, the inaccurate news from C4 comes a week after our city counsel was reported to have wanted to nix the DPD and create a Peace Force.  These are constant seeds of discouragement that unsettle people who live all over the city."

2724,177596075,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,11w,"Thank you for starting this discussion! It sure highlights how women have borne a huge burden this past year, and continue to bear enormous losses. A huge sector of talented and hardworking employees is lost because of misguided policies.(edited)"
2725,177596075,Randall Sampson,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,18 Feb,"I am very liberal in my political views, but I may not be ‚Äúwoke.‚Äù I don‚Äôt quite get what is offensive. Isn‚Äôt the point being made in this very brief article is that working women are hit inordinately hard during these times (not only because of traditional nurturing ‚Äúduties,‚Äù but also because of the effects of a long history of workplace discrimination)? Is that not reality?"
2726,177596075,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,11w,"Randall, being very liberal in your political views...do all kinds of alarms bells not go off when you read this?"
2727,177596075,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,11w,"There is nothing at all offensive about this story. (Edit here...I'm taking issue with ""She-Cession"" because it implies a choice when there isn't one.) The story recognizes once again how Covid magnifies that women have three jobs, and something has to give. I‚Äôm offended by those who don‚Äôt understand the story. Some families aren‚Äôt privileged enough to make it on a single salary, or must have 2 or more jobs to pay for housing, food, and health insurance. A truly sobering statistic...the previous national jobless claim report had 800,000...all women.(edited)"
2728,177596075,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,19 Feb,"Patricia you are missing the point entirely.  Do the names ""Common Sense Institute"" and ""Executives Partnering to Invest in Children"" sound at all suspicious?  What is the real agenda here?  You can be sure that agenda is not at all aligned with the interests of ""working women"".  Do you find it suspicious that the Child Benefit was not mentioned?  That race or income divisions were not mentioned?  Im not being glib here... read it again and see what you think"
2729,177596075,Nancy Cuprisin,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,19 Feb,I don't find it offensive. You have a right to.
2730,177596075,Eve Cohen,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Feb,"The only thing distasteful to me is the  headline of the piece, which was likely not written by the author. It‚Äôs FOX ; what do you expect? The findings of the research seem sound. My only quibble with the orgs that sponsored the research is they seem to expect business to shoulder all the financial burdens currently borne by women/families ( childcare, etc), as opposed to government, as is the case in most industrialized countries, where ample parental paid leave, subsidized quality childcare, and other assistance to families with kids are standard. The US gives lip-service to being pro-child and pro-family, while doing the bare minimum to actually support parents in successfully raising small children."
2731,177596075,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,19 Feb,"Eve, my contention runs the other way.  These groups want to address the problem (a problem they created) on their terms.  They definitely do NOT want to shoulder the financial burden of transitioning the US to those western industrial models you mention.  That involves taxation.  They want private sector initiatives and so on.  Which, to be perfectly clear, means the following: Not only do they not want to be taxed to pay for this, they want to remove this from the public sector altogether and make money off of providing that service.  At least that is my reading"
2732,177596075,Elizabeth Budd,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Feb,"The crux of the matter is the classic ""second shift"" of home and child responsibilities that fall disproportionately on working women. It's been under study for decades; the pandemic has just added to the ongoing reality of what working mothers face."
2733,177596075,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Feb,"COVID has magnified the second shift, and in fact added a third: childcare/education. A paying job outside the home, the larger burden of the household, and the children."
2734,177596075,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Feb,"The October 2020 employment report made headlines far beyond the business pages...more than 800,000 WOMEN could NOT sustain the Third Shift. Keep in mind some are single parents who had to begin unemployment benefits...they had to choose between the work outside the home and caring/educating children. THIS is the real story. Employers in some situations laid off those workers because the juggle wasn't working. The headline in this link is also misleading: ""Dropped out of the labor force"" does not tell the entire story. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/865000-women-dropped-out-of-the-labor-force-in-september-2020.htmlhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/865000-women-dropped-out-of-the-labor-force-in-september-2020.html"
2735,177596075,Shannon Haines,‚Ä¢ Skyland,19 Feb,I don‚Äôt find it offensive and I respect those of you that do regardless of whether or not I understand why. I have always been among the working class and I‚Äôm also a single mom. After the pandemic everything got more challenging for everybody especially our kids who were forced into school electronically. It‚Äôs been a learning experience for both us parents and our kids. I‚Äôm out of work right now full time (I have part time flexible employment) and it‚Äôs certainly not paying the bills living where there is an inflated cost of living so I apply for numerous full time roles every week. I‚Äôm doing this because my daughter is back in school. I have a hard time seeing what juggling full time employment and her doing home school looks like so I get the article. I welcome any feedback that explains why the article has the potential to be offensive though. Be safe.
2736,177596075,Rhonda Lampe,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,19 Feb,This has to be a Joke! Look at where it‚Äôs coming from ‚Äú The Common Sense Media?? Who are they?? How did they come up with this!! Ha ha!ü§™

2739,177596075,Amanda Russcol,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,19 Feb,"As a working mom and entrepreneur who has become almost full-time childcare over the last year, I do not see how this is offensive. It's true. If the truth offends you, that might be something to look at? "
2740,177596075,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Feb,"Amanda, I thought the same at first, and I appreciate that CJ did later offer up more detailed commentary. It appears that most of us in this string have found common ground about the very difficult position of mothers who are working not just the  ""first and second"" shift, but the third in childcare and education during their own full-time work."
2741,177596075,Tatiana Masterson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,19 Feb,"The wording is offensive and I didn‚Äôt see the article accounting for women that started their own business or for those that work virtually for national companies based in other states or even international ones while living in Denver. So they are not in the work force? It might show in their federal tax returns but not on the state tax return. But yes, some women had to spend more time giving child care and did not return to, for those I would not call it a she-cession but a recession just like for men that can‚Äôt go back to work for any reason. I know fathers that don‚Äôt work and mothers that do. Tired of this story that only women are caregivers, written by a woman!"
2742,177596075,Rita Gibson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,19 Feb,"I am 63 years old. I did not want to give my kids to daycare or other people to take care of them. We juggled. My husband had a full-time law practice. I had a business we shared but I ran. Sometimes I couldn't work regular hours so I would go into work 10PM and work til 4PM, sleep til it was time for the kids to get up and I would get them off to school and monitor them through out the day; work out in the morning, nap until it was time to pick them up from school (choice schools, no bussing, which I would not have subjected my kids to the hell that was public bus transportation) Hello? Life is not easy and a good life is a struggle and worth it. Both of my kids are very successful and I dedicated my life during those years to making sure they could be successful. Raising kids is a full-time job even though folk out there want to make it less that that. Raising good kids is more important than anything else you can do. If you can figure out how to do it with hired help go for it. If you are lucky to have family members to help and keep your career, I commend you."
2743,177596075,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,11w,"Yes, that was difficult, yet some parents and single parents have fewer options. It‚Äôs not only a matter of keeping a career, but survival.(edited)"

2749,177596075,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,20 Feb,Thank you for this crucial perspective.
2750,177596075,Jason Hill,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,11w,This well written Forbes article about the she-cession will help clarify many  of the comments in this thread. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/16/the-she-cessions-hidden-opportunity
2751,177596075,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,11w,"Let‚Äôs not perpetuate the inaccurate She-Cession. Secession implies a choice. If the wordplay is women‚Äôs (economic) recession, the term does not at all address the truth of why women...although I‚Äôll risk assuming every woman knows...whether single or not. Women are being devalued out of the workplace, wholesale. The October 2020 jobs report of more than 800,000 filing for unemployment was 100% WOMEN. (If you listen to public radio, The Marketplace program on PRI (Kai Rysdahl/sp) reported that stunning statistic. The New York Times, Inc. Mag, and many other media are reporting the choice of women to file for unemployment because they have to educate their children at home and have not been able to work simultaneously or have positions outside the home and no childcare...is that a she-cession? Hardly. We need a better term (also not exodus...explusion?) and honor 50% + of the workforce. With all due respect to the author of the Forbes article, how many women have access to capital, childcare, and all the infrastructure it takes to create a new business during COVID? Many are barely keeping it together. Sure, there can be opportunity in crisis, but let‚Äôs also be realistic about who can access the privilege of these possibilities when many are in survival mode.(edited)"
2752,177596075,Jessica Watson,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,22 Feb,Lane O. Facts! Thank you for explaining it in that way! I was only seeing the struggle of juggling all those things and felt we all do that but I see what you mean anf your absolutely  right.
2753,177596075,Lane O‚ÄôConnor,‚Ä¢ Hale,22 Feb,I‚Äôm glad we were able to have a constructive discussion about it!
2754,164265597,Brian Laniel,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,12 Oct,Only way to stop it is to get the owner to sell it to you.
2755,164265597,Stacy Oh,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Oct,Exactly.  My neighbors in my old neighborhood (West Washington Park) formed an LLC to buy & refurbish my 1886 house so developers couldn't get to it. Now it's a historic property.
2756,164265597,Stacy Oh,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,18 Oct,It was featured on 9News.
2757,164265597,Denise Hohl,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,12 Oct,I will research what I can. I it's egregious to tear down a historic home to put a generic box duplex
2758,164265597,Becky Eich,‚Ä¢ Hale,12 Oct,This will happen much more frequently if the group living proposal is passed by our city council members so be sure to reach out to them if you don‚Äôt want to lose these historic homes.
2759,164265597,Todd Gordon,‚Ä¢ Lowry,12 Oct,"While I understand that you'd prefer to keep the older home, as long as the new structure being built is within zoning guidelines, there is nothing you should do to stop it. Perhaps the current owner has all their savings tied up in the house and the developer is offering the most money. How would you feel if someone told you you weren't allowed to access the equity you've been building for years?"
2760,164265597,Elizabeth MacDonald,‚Ä¢ Lowry,12 Oct,Good point.
2761,164265597,Becky Eich,‚Ä¢ Hale,13 Oct,"I agree- since the zoning is in place, there is nothing that can be done. However, we can do something about the new group living zoning proposal which will allow this type of zoning in most of Denver.  It will also add many more correctional facilities, halfway homes, and homeless shelters to the neighborhoods."
2762,164265597,Paul Brown,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Oct,This is false on so many levels. You should be able to make your point without trying to scare people (and for the record I'm not for the proposal).
2763,164265597,Simon Lofts,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,13 Oct,The other commentators are correct. You'd have to purchase it.
2764,164265597,Mark Cozart,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Oct,"I think the issue is really architectural approval. I hate the feel of the modern homes sporadically placed in our historic neighborhoods. Unfortunately, many buildings have been built on the former sites of the Denver squares in Congress Park over the years. The street in question already has several multi family buildings that my mom, who grew up here calls courts. So the density issue in this case is probably not an issue. Is there a method in place for more control over the architecture in these cases."
2765,164265597,Simon Lofts,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,13 Oct,"I'm not sure upon what date governmental interference and design crept in but on balance it does not appear, repeat appear, to have been for the better."
2766,164265597,Stephanie Jackson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,13 Oct,"I agree. This happened to my hair stylist who purchased a home on south Pearl to run her salon. She changed some things on the inside, but left the outside and whoever bought the house next door put up a modern small condo building - my stylist was mad, but there was nothing she could do."
2767,164265597,Erik Stark,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,30w,"The process for saving a home is complicated and never in favor of preservation.  Anyone who wants to demolish a house has to apply for a CNHS (Certificate of Non-Historic Status).  As part of this process, the City should have a sign posted on the outside announcing the intent to demolish the structure and a timeline for anyone to respond if they want to try to prevent that.  You only have a few weeks to get at least 3 people to fill out an Application for Landmark Designation.  It's a complicated and in-depth application, often requiring research on the property, owners over the years, history, architect, etc.  The fee is $875.  Also part of this CNHS process, Landmark in Denver (part of Community Planning and Development) is required to look at it and determine if the structure has historic potential for designation.  It needs to meet at least 2 of 3 criteria (many other cities and localities require only 1 of 3) in history, architecture, and geography.  If they say yes, and accept your Application as properly filled out, the process goes before Landmark again, and then City Council, where each must say it deserves to be protected and designated.  Particularly at City Council, they are loathe to do what are called ""Hostile Designations"" (the owner doesn't want to preserve it) and haven't done any for several years is my understanding.  In other words, if the owner wants it demolished, the preservation plan dies at Council."
2768,164265597,Stephanie Jackson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,13 Oct,"Is there an HOA in your neighborhood?  I‚Äôm assuming not. I live in Lowry, not in a historic house, but on historic land. We have a Lowry master HOA and my two previous properties were in complexes that had HOAs. Not always fun, but keeps the property nice."
2769,164265597,Becky Eich,‚Ä¢ Hale,13 Oct,"I‚Äôve listened to several LUTI meetings and the councilmembers brought up HOAs and made the point that HOAs cannot restrict a zoning ordinance as it relates to federal and state protected classes to include the mentally ill. So your neighborhood is more protected than others but not completely. Again, I‚Äôm not trying to scare you, or anyone for that matter, I‚Äôm just trying to make people aware."

2771,164265597,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,30w,"Denver City Counsel are all Developers. Hancock has not met a developer he didn‚Äôt like.  Lucky for us Hancock can‚Äôt run again.  I‚Äôm sorry this is happening! Many of our beautiful older neighborhoods have been destroyed by these rebuilds like Crestmore.  Several years ago Parkhill tried to pass Historic Parkhill provision, It was quite controversial.  But stopped for now this .  Vote and vote!(edited)"
2772,164265597,Churchill Bunn,‚Ä¢ Country Club,15 Oct,"City Council is actually fairly anti-development these days, which can be seen in a few very recent rezoning decisions.  The CNHS process is also becoming less owner/developer friendly, as can be seen in several recent cases if you‚Äôve been following the news.  Whether you‚Äôre for or against these things, believe everything you read on NextDoor, like Kristen‚Äôs comment above."
2773,164265597,Stephanie Jackson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,13 Oct,I just asked the question as that could be a resource. I‚Äôm a lawyer and served on my HOA Board for ten years so I understand these issues. I also own three properties so I am very familiar with these issues.
2774,164265597,Larah Thomson,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Oct,"This is one reason I love living in 7th Avenue Historic District, one less issue is a great thing right now."
2775,164265597,Stephanie Jackson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,13 Oct,"Well, hopefully you do not have this same issue. It happens often."
2776,164265597,Nathan Shinn,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14 Oct,"If you‚Äôre against infill development and higher density, you‚Äôre in favor of sprawl. I‚Äôve lined in dense cities on the coasts and I‚Äôve lived in Houston and Phoenix. High-density beats sprawl any day."
2777,164265597,Erik Stark,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Oct,"Nathan, high-density Denver style could in fact create more sprawl.  Denver's version is to scrape entire blocks, often of old homes, and put up generic boxes.... boxes next to boxes, on top of boxes, repeat.  They then charge an average of 500K for these, creating more density but no affordability.  The generic ugliness of much of Denver's density serves developer interests primarily by allowing the cheapest construction costs-wise to maximize profits.  Nothing here is appealing in this version of density.  Density can be great, but it's not a panacea in every case."
2778,164265597,Laurie Kagan,‚Ä¢ Lowry,14 Oct,"Erik, You are correct that there‚Äôs law that prevents mandating affordable units. It all goes back to a √ßolorado Supreme Court decision called Telluride. There will be legislation introduced this upcoming session to attempt to override or chip away at the Telluride ruling to increase cities‚Äô options in mandating affordable housing. If you would like to be alerted to opportunities to learn about this legislation and to advocate for it, send me a private message and I‚Äôll keep you in the loop."
2779,164265597,John Sunderland,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Oct,Just curious.  What can be built on a standard 50'x110' lot??  I noticed the other day that a small home I owned in Mayfair has been replaced by a 2 story duplex.
2780,164265597,Churchill Bunn,‚Ä¢ Country Club,16 Oct,"Erik Stark the CNHS process favors property rights and property owners.  If they denied every request the City would be on the Supreme Court docket monthly and spending taxpayer dollars to fight these cases. Property rights are a significant part of the constitution.  If you‚Äôve followed some of the recent rezoning requests you would probably at least admit City Council has been less pro-development than they used to be.  Anyway, no point arguing that, it‚Äôs a matter of opinion.  I do follow them and have seen a shift since the last CC elections."
2781,164265597,Erik Stark,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,29w,"The shift isn't about less or more pro-development.  That's part of my point.  The shift, and this has been worked on by the previous City Council, was to get more of a conversation going between owner/developers and the community for properties that were deemed worthy of such.  Whether they're worthy of that conversation or not may have some subjectivity involved but it's generally going to be properties that have some significant history or presence in the neighborhood that some folks think are worth fighting for.  This issue of property rights is obviously significant and drives the majority of the ultimate outcomes.  But I think the issue of developers demolishing old structures, including homes, then putting up cheap crap that they charge a high price for, begins calling into question the whole notion that property rights are the only thing that ever matters in how a city evolves and is able to keep some continuity and affordability in neighborhoods.  Denver has done a terrifically terrible job in this regard overall and communities are starting to push back.  The process can definitely be improved and having a conversation built-in to the demolition process is a good start.(edited)"

Yes the sign is there and yes I will submit my payment forthe violation but shame on the city for not providing at least a heads up that what hadn't been enforced since covid began is now active again.

2833,159233626,Gaar Potter,‚Ä¢ Happy Canyon,37w,Denver has proven with it's 10-year Road Home that it cannot responsibly undertake this function:
2834,159233626,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,25 Aug,"And it turns out that the building Denver purchased 3 years ago for homeless care is being utilized for that cause, effectively, by the Denver Rescue Mission."
2835,159233626,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,25 Aug,"The Denver Auditor, Tim O'Brian, has repeatedly pointed out some lack of clarity as to where the tax revenues from the sales of marijuana have been going. This is a lot of money.  So, until the 4 car garage of the house can be cleaned up and it's contents properly accounted for, why build another closet for storage, which will only get bigger."
2836,159233626,Ola Z.,‚Ä¢ University Park,25 Aug,I think last year we voted yes on tax for mental health for homeless population. Any report how how $ was/is used? Is it getting better.
2837,159233626,George C.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,37w,"Not to sound like negative Nancy,  but the more programs you create for homelessness the bigger the population of homeless gets. Just research San Francisco. "
2838,159233626,Karen N.,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,25 Aug,"Ha! Well that explains the reason we have so many wild fires, too. We have sooooo many fire fighters so the fires just get bigger and bigger. You should write a book on cause and effect."
2839,159233626,Colin Griffith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Aug,"The increase is small enough that it won't materially affect most  taxpayers, but it could make a difference for people unhoused people in need of support. But research has shown again and again that the only effective way to end homelessness is to create and guarantee housing, so this incremental effort isn't going to do anything to address the root of the problem."

2841,159233626,Diann Osborne,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,25 Aug,I love people debating homeless without rolling up their sleeves and talking to the real people that work tirelessly to help.
2842,159233626,Cindy B.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,26 Aug,"Until you have safe, stable housing, you can't address mental health!  It is circular.  One thing is for certain, ignoring the problem clearly doesn't make it go away."
2843,159233626,Ann Brannan Joyce,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,26 Aug,NO
2844,159233626,Sam Speight,‚Ä¢ North Side,26 Aug,Anyone heard of or read the Denver Green Print Document?  It might interest the public to be aware of such things before voting for this. With the billions we've already dumped into solving this issue and the fact that it's only gotten much worse it seems logical to believe who ever controls these taxes for this purpose are either wildly incompetent or living well beyond their means. Either way I'd council a negative for this tax. And a much much smaller governing body.
2845,159233626,John C.,‚Ä¢ Berkeley Park,27 Aug,I won‚Äôt vote for any tax increase unless it involves abducting vagrant addicts and forcing them into rehab programs that they have to complete. If this violates civil liberties and the ACLU steps then I can‚Äôt vote for it. Programs should guarantee social stability at 90% or more. If I can‚Äôt see efficacy and enough upward mobility then I‚Äôd rather see tax dollars spent elsewhere.
2846,159233626,John C.,‚Ä¢ Berkeley Park,27 Aug,"Sam Speight I know what they‚Äôve become. They represent a shell of constitutional rights and their lawyers seem to cherry pick the hot political issues. folks around here talk about helping the homeless addicts but it‚Äôs futile if people are in a place where they can‚Äôt help themselves or care to get help at all. Whether new homeless programs are passed or not, I predict it getting worse without recovery coercion."

2899,182215160,Renee Rupp,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,2 Apr,"Ryan, thanks for sharing that amazing video on how to fix this kind of problem. Amazing and kind of you!"
2900,182215160,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,2 Apr,"One has to remember, our culture encourages overspending to replace things that can be repaired. "
2901,182215160,Eric Wakefield,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,2 Apr,Wow! WTF is wrong with people these days? So sorry to hear that this happened to you & so senseless & for what? Yes I‚Äôve used JB Weld to repair many things & it truly works if you prep the surfaces correctly. Far less expensive and it works.
2902,182215160,Jennifer Krajicek,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,3 Apr,"Eric, thank you. I wish I had known this was a thing before I had it towed to my shop. I figured something was seriously wrong based on how my instrument panel was displaying.  : ("

2904,182215160,Jennifer Krajicek,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,3 Apr,"Thanks and yes, I will have to look into an alarm/motion detector."
2905,182215160,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Apr,"Jennifer Krajicek get something that has a huge speaker and put it underneath your car with the volume cranked to at least 11. If someone comes to drill a hole in your tank or swipe your catalytic converter, make the alarm go off at about a million decibels to at least break the thief's eardrums!!"
2906,182215160,Cindy Keesom,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,2 Apr,I‚Äôm sorry that this happened to you. So bizarre! What part of Montclair do you live in?
2907,182215160,Jennifer Krajicek,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,3 Apr,Thank you.  I live On Holly St.
2908,182215160,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,3 Apr,Maybe your neighbors have video has the perpetrators
2909,182215160,Jennifer Krajicek,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,3 Apr,"Yes, I‚Äôm checking. But I‚Äôm"
2910,182215160,Richard Stull,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,3 Apr,They should be able to plug the hole versus a new tank.
2911,182215160,Jennifer Krajicek,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,3 Apr,The shop said they won‚Äôt do a patch as it‚Äôs not safe/secure. And it‚Äôs now up on a lift inside the shop which is closed until Mon. I wish I had known anything about this whole scenario as I would‚Äôve known what to look for & pursued the patch fix instead. Hopefully someone else can benefit from the post/info.
2912,182215160,Jesus Barraza,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 Apr,"Have you notice a very common thing among victims of theft? They all seem to not have cameras. Why wait until something happens, to get security cameras? All them fake vendors going door to door I bet you that's what they are actually watching. To see who doesn't have cameras. I'm just saying, all I know is that I know nothing."
2913,182215160,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,3 Apr,"Cameras are expensive and don't prevent crimes from happening. Lots of people post on here showing the person on camera who just robbed them, and even with someone on camera, the police aren't going to go stage a search looking for someone, so all that cameras do is allow you to see someone ripping you off."
2914,182215160,Dorothy Hotchkiss,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 Apr,I spoke to my mechanic bc I need to replace mine and yes 24-2500 is absolutely right..I choose not to replace it right now bc of all the steeling of the catalytic converters..he told me they get good money for them and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening!! 
2915,182215160,Jonathan Donley,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,3 Apr,$2500??? Screw that. Slap some JB weld on there for $10.
2916,182215160,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,3 Apr,Sadly our culture has evolved from simple repairs as there is no profit margin.
2917,182215160,Lawrence Johnston,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,3 Apr,"Why would anyone do this? What is the point of drilling a hole in a gas tank? What are they trying to steal, gasoline?"
2918,182215160,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5w,"Yup, the below YouTube link is a quick run down on the why and how.."
2919,182215160,Jon Bowman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 Apr,Some people are out of work and the old you got it I want mentality  kicks in I guess SAD what he left‚Äî the legacy that is
2920,182215160,Anthony Lewis,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 Apr,I would sand the area around the hole with with grit sandpaper. Then I would mix the JB Weld and put some in the hole. Then put sand 1/4 brass screw with a flat head in the hole and push a little JB Weld under it. Then mop a area of about 2x2 around the hole and on top of the brass screw. Believe I'm a Master Plumber and have fixed Garbage Disposal's with small holes with JB Weld and it has worked when most Plumber's tell people
2921,182215160,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5w,"Brass screw, do we want to add a conductive point into the gas tank? "
2922,168201943,Ellen Moncrief,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,18 Nov,Thx
2923,168201943,Joyce Malone,‚Ä¢ Lowry,18 Nov,Thank you for warning us about this awful event and your mom's loss.
2924,168201943,Arianna Blazovic,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,18 Nov,Very true. Scariest part we discovered they tampered with some of the kitchen windows. They were for sure trying to get inside. So scary!
2925,168201943,Deb Montour,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,18 Nov,I have asked the police to patrol and it appears that unless somebody gets hurt or personal property is damaged they won't do it. They will sit in parking lots at the Montessori School and catch up with each other in their cars but they won't drive around and be visible.
2926,168201943,Michele blazovic,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,18 Nov,i tried to file a report 3 times today but to no avail!! They told me to do it online but I've been searching for where to do so!!I even went to our district station tonight and was told to file online. Not very helpful.. The person/persons moved large rocks from our gardens which i found under windows this am. I woke up sometime after 1 am when i heard a commotion at our kitchen window- very frightening but at the time i wasn't sure i heard anything'real'
2927,168201943,Patrick Navarro,‚Ä¢ Hale,19 Nov,"Welcome to very real realization that cops don‚Äôt prevent crime, and that they only respond to it, thus, rendering them absolutely worthless when it comes to ‚Äúkeeping the community safe‚Äù."
2928,168201943,Elaine Farrell,‚Ä¢ Hudson Street,18 Nov,thank you for keeping us informed.
2929,168201943,Jill King,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,18 Nov,Everyone keep your doors locked and valuables out of your car!
2930,168201943,Cae Dizzo,‚Ä¢ City Park West,18 Nov,"Sorry that happened. Just a reminder to folks that the DMV includes a copy of your registration *without* your address or other information, and that is the one to keep in your car. Worth checking that you only have that copy in the vehicle in case it is broken into."
2931,168201943,Deb M.,‚Ä¢ Valentia Court,18 Nov,I‚Äôm so sorry!!! Glad your ok and please reach if you need anything!
2932,168201943,Kathleen Green,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,18 Nov,"Terrible! I live right around the corner. Our house got hit around this time about 5 years ago. I will definitely be on the look out. The police had determined that who ever broke in had been casing the place. So, one thing to watch for are people sitting in unfamiliar cars during the day or night."
2933,168201943,Michele blazovic,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,18 Nov,I've called many times about suspicious persons
2934,168201943,Susan Kabir,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,18 Nov,"Twice to me in the last month.  Car, opened back gate, opened garage door.   Incidentals in car stolen, like in your mom's case.  Lights on now, gate locked at all times,  but it's all so dismaying, isn't it?"
2935,168201943,Michele blazovic,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,18 Nov,"hi susie-its ariannas mom/ yes, car break in not so bad but they tried my kitchen window- creepy- glad i turned all lights on !!"
2936,168201943,Carol S.,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,19 Nov,I would be more concerned with the police response. Lackadaisical attitudes like what you have pointed out is what makes crime flourish.
2937,168201943,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Nov,I believe one scam article said that if your registration papers are stolen you should put a freeze on your credit reports. These can be used to file for credit cards and loans.
2938,168201943,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Nov,"You can condemn the police all you want but 2 years ago a vehicle with three people in it ran through my fence and took off running. The incident report on Sept 3 was i believe 640,000+ and i believe that is the number of incident reports filed in Denver alone. Two months later i filed another and i believe that was 720,000+. I was told by one of the officers it was due to ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù. With the pandemic, homeless and open borders this will likely increase."
2939,168201943,Michele blazovic,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,19 Nov,who's condemning the police???
2940,168201943,Loretta Sheridan,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,19 Nov,"This is shocking, but not uncommon.  Many people leave that window unlocked for convenience.  My"
2941,168201943,Orah Zipper,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,19 Nov,That's terrible. Thank G-d they didn't come in & your mom wasn't hurt. I have friends on that block! Will tell them immediately.
2942,168201943,Karyn Schiele,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,19 Nov,So sorry that happened . You guys stay safe üòò.
2943,168201943,Arianna Blazovic,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,19 Nov,Omg Karyn!!!!!! We were just talking about you the other day!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

2946,168201943,Robin Jones,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,20 Nov,Marci Penner just posted glasses being found at Crestmoor park which is south of there but may have been dumped
2947,168201943,Nancy D.,‚Ä¢ Woodside Village,20 Nov,"I live at Woodside Village, here over last few months many cars have been broken into, we all lock our cars.  Some cars have been stolen or damaged trying to steal. One of my neighbors just had her catalytic converter stolen off her car overnight.  All have been reported to the police.  I'm sure they're overwhelmed with reports."
2948,158367081,Katie Keltie,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,17 Aug,"üò≥ Because it wasn't hot or smoky enough. Damn,  that's scary."
2949,158367081,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,17 Aug,This is why we need homeless shelters in every Denver residential neighborhood.
2950,160779760,Sandi Heller,‚Ä¢ Hale,8 Sep,Very lovely post. Thank you for reminding us to be neighborly. ‚ù§Ô∏è
2951,160779760,Kristin Myers,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,8 Sep,"Thank you so much for this post! I put out a bin and a bag at the bus stop on 8th and Harrison with some coats, blankets, and hats. Just in case anyone  sees someone in the area. Thank you for the good idea and neighborly spirit, Julie!"
2952,160779760,Marissa Star,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,8 Sep,Great Idea!
2953,160779760,John Stouffer,‚Ä¢ Lowry,8 Sep,I will start to do that.
2954,160779760,Tina Davis,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,8 Sep,"I think the idea of providing some clothes is a  thoughtful one, and don't want to throw cold water on wonderful intentions, but I have had things stolen out of my alley-facing garage several times when the garage door was left open accidentally for only a minute.  The police told me that putting stuff out in the alley is not a good idea because it can result in crimes of opportunity (someone hanging out in an alley where people regularly leave stuff out and then seeing an open door.)  I wonder if there is a better place that we can leave clothes for the homeless during a cold snap.  The bus stop is probably a great place."
2955,160779760,Julie Bentley,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Sep,That makes a lot of sense thanks for calling that out!
2956,160779760,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,10 Sep,"Bus stops, any place where you regularly see tents or someone panhandling, and Civic Center are all good spots.  You can hang things in bags (so they don't get wet if they are found after the snow starts) on fence posts or set them inside a bus shelter or if it's small/light like socks, put it in a sandwich baggie and tape it to a lightpost or whatever is around in a frequented area. Be sure to put a note like ""free to a good home"" or something so people know they can take it without issue.  As someone else said, Humanity free store, and Denver Homeless Out Loud also take donations and hand them out to people."
2957,160779760,Debra Roads,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Sep,I volunteer with feeding Denver's hungry and two members passed out 100 new coats and waterproof tarps on Sunday/Monday. Many homeless lose everything during the sweeps.
2958,160779760,Kristin Myers,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,34w,"Is there a place we can donate to replenish supplies, Debra?(edited)"
2959,160779760,Jim Scharper,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,9 Sep,consider donating to the free clothing store called Humanity
2960,160779760,Jim Scharper,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,9 Sep,Feeding Denver's Hungry has a donation box at Mile High Comics 4600 Jason Street for cold weather gear
2961,160779760,Randy Kopf,‚Ä¢ City Park West,10 Sep,I love the idea of leaving stuff out with a free sign. Thanks OP
2962,160779760,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,10 Sep,"And just a thought - if any of you are able, especially if you are involved with a community space who might be willing to host one, a Little Free Pantry (like little free libraries, but for food and toiletries) would be super awesome to have in the neighborhood. Maybe a church would be willing to put one up in their yard? I'm an apartment dweller so I don't have a yard and I don't belong to a church or I would have been trying to make one ages ago. These can help everyone, homeless or not, because a lot of us have struggled at one time or another to buy groceries or diapers or whatever, even when we were housed."
2963,160779760,Crystal Andersson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Sep,I love your heart! ‚ù§Ô∏è
2964,160779760,Anne Bouise Ward,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,10 Sep,I think you have a great heart.

2966,164224898,Liz Barron,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,12 Oct,"Saturday just after sunset when driving home I spotted a young man on Alameda & Dexter who appeared to be taking photos of the house on the corner. ( I told him he was in a bad location as someone had had a gun pulled on him 1 block away that morning.) without any acknowledgement, he pulled up his coat hood and walked away. I told the homeowner who called the police as she‚Äôd seen him earlier lingering around her neighbor‚Äôs house across the street.( The police responded but apparently they could not find him.)"
2967,164224898,Dannie Aschenbrener,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,12 Oct,So scary... glad you guys are safe. Thanks for sharing.
2968,164224898,Allen Shaw,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,12 Oct,"This is becoming more and more frequent in our neighborhood.  We as well had 2 strangers either enter our yard and come to the door asking about the vacant house adjacent to ours.  More vigilance on everyone‚Äôs part.  It is better to be overly cautious.  As I mentioned in an earlier post, we had a car stolen from the front of our house 2 weeks ago. It was found, crashed into a pot dispensary in Denver and whoever stole it attempted to burn it.  The bad guys are becoming more brazen and more frequent"

2970,164224898,Deb Montour,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,30w,"Glad you were able to chase him off. The problem with every Ring Thing that I see, is that you can never get a good video where the subjects can be identified.(edited)"
2971,164224898,Alexandra Larkin,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,12 Oct,"Saw another man in someone's front yard leaning on a tree around 7am but wasn't able to tell if he was homeless or not, didn't see any items with him or anything. He seemed startled when I came out and saw him but he stayed there. Between 7th and 8th Ave on Clermont."
2972,164224898,Jenny Rosenberg,‚Ä¢ Cherry - Leetsdale,12 Oct,I noticed my backyard fence door was opened 2 nights ago which I thought was odd but dismissed it.  Now that I‚Äôm reading these posts it makes me think someone did enter.
2973,164224898,Jill King,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,30w,I found a house key on my patio right outside my back door on Friday. The key does not work on any of the locks to my house and doesn't belong to anyone that lives here. Nobody else has been here since early September.

2978,164224898,Lesley Lochhead,‚Ä¢ Lowry,12 Oct,Really frightening. This communication helps everyone so thank you.  My fear is this will get worse while folks are experiencing so many different kinds of stress.   I am glad you are safe. Be well and stay safe.
2979,164224898,Cristy Slater,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,12 Oct,More and more I'm being convinced that I need to take what little money that I have and get a camera for my front door.
2980,164224898,Jeanne Cipollini,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,12 Oct,We had two attempted break ins this week on our block in Congress Park. One was in broad daylight and they successfully got away with garage items. The other was a back door but they didn‚Äôt get in.
2981,164224898,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,30w,"FWIW (and I know this isn't a quick fix nor cheap to replace a fence, just putting it out there where people are discussing such things for people to consider if maybe they are replacing their fence in the future), I was watching this video where it was former burglars gave advice about what they looked for regarding home security or if they thought a house made a good target.  One of the things they mentioned was that privacy fences entice them, because they can hide back there - whereas if you have an open picket fence or a chain link fence or something, where neighbors can see in, they are less likely to target your house because someone might notice them.  Just food for thought.  I know people like their private space, but with the rise in break ins, it's worth considering.(edited)"

3017,161378983,Nicole Walsh,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,15 Sep,"Thanks, Barb, I will bring a bag or two to your porch soon!  For your neighbor's work putting together a pantry for an elementary school - food only?  Or do they want warm kids' clothes as well?"
3018,161378983,Barbara McMahon,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Sep,"Both, thanks Nicole! It is an elementary school, so clothes for kids in that age group k-5 are what she is hoping to collect."
3019,161378983,Kathy Fiore,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,15 Sep,I will do another walk-thru my closets and for sure be bringing more than 1 bag!

3024,161378983,Kiki Kauffman,‚Ä¢ Lowry,16 Sep,"Thank you for doing this! I'll drop some things to you. Hey, I know the homeless need personal products...Kleenex, feminine hygiene products, etc. If I buy some, can you donate those? LMK!"

3030,176456092,Laurie Bogue,‚Ä¢ Hale,9 Feb,That's truly adding insult to injury. I am so sorry that this happened to you. Take care and be safe!
3031,176456092,Lindsey Rae,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Feb,thank u üíï you too
3032,176456092,Lea McLean,‚Ä¢ Lowry,9 Feb,That‚Äôs horrible! I am so sorry
3033,176456092,Anthony Lewis,‚Ä¢ Hale,9 Feb,I'm very sorry to hear this about your car. I think as many deterrent's you can use would help. One get a steering will Club lock. Two after getting home raise your hood and take a couple of Spark Plug
3034,176456092,Lindsey Rae,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Feb,"Yes - the officer who did the police report said they will give you a club if you go to the station, so I am going to look into that."
3035,176456092,Anthony Lewis,‚Ä¢ Hale,9 Feb,Take the connection off of at least 2 Spark Plugs. They won't get far at all and most likely won't take the time to figure out what's wrong with the car.
3036,176456092,Widicker Ava,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Feb,This is disgusting how many cars stolen in our neighborhood.
3037,176456092,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,10 Feb,"agreed.  i remember a time when you didnt have to lock your doors, car or home.  when you could leave your bike unlocked outside the market, in the city center."
3038,176456092,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,10 Feb,"Im not old enough to know if this was ever the case in the US.  Probably not.  But my time in the Nordics this past decade was wild.  Just park your bike in downtown Oslo, no lock needed.  it was there when you got back.  The place I stayed in Denmark didn't even have deadbolts on the doors."
3039,176456092,Simon Lofts,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,10 Feb,And it is said that things come in threes. So best buy a used Jaguar and you'll be relieved (terrible pun) when it's gone.
3040,176456092,Lutrelle Smart,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Feb,No cute comment. I was asked to post that we had two Hyundais taken from our apartment lot in the last few days.  The address is 1240 Elizabeth.  There is a keyed locking system that goes from the floor to the steering wheel and locks it.  Might be worth investing in.
3041,176456092,Lindsey Rae,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Feb,I was told by the officer that they are targeting Hyundais/kias and sometimes subarus with a method where they use a factory key
3042,176456092,Tara Tull,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Feb,Holy cow! The car theft in our lovely neighborhood is getting out of control. So sorry this happened to you.
3043,176456092,Simon Lofts,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,10 Feb,"Thefts of all nature will increase exponentially in parallel with shortage of jobs, lack of income, hunger and so on."
3044,176456092,Elaine Taniwaki,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Feb,"Well now, there's some irony..."
3045,176456092,Mark Ryan,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,10 Feb,"Getting a car stolen is happening to more of us, but still relatively small number.  We will all get hit with higher insurance rates...."
3046,176456092,JoHanna Weszely,‚Ä¢ City Park,10 Feb,FYI:  over the last few weeks two cars have been stolen from our parking lot and several have been vandalized. On Steel Street between 16th & 17th Avenues.
3047,176456092,Kittie Hook,‚Ä¢ Lowry,10 Feb,So sorry to hear this happened to you not only once but twice.  Best of luck and best thing is that you are safe.

3067,164957151,Linda Hendrick,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,19 Oct,Best news I've hear ALL DAY! Thank Heavens! Prayers for some excellent mental health providers to help her.

3072,164957151,Eric Wakefield,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,20 Oct,Thank you. Yes agreed. The system for mental illness is beyond broken. Very sad but a huge relief
3073,164957151,Christine Hayutin,‚Ä¢ Lowry,19 Oct,Thank G-d she was found. That‚Äôs so very far away?
3074,164957151,Steve Kregstein,‚Ä¢ Cherry - Leetsdale,19 Oct,Happy for you
3075,163913093,Michael Paglia,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,8 Oct,"Yes outdoor cats are rare in Denver--maybe because of the dangers from foxes, coyotes and racoons. Also Denver has a preponderance of responsible pet owners, so that may explain it, too. Our animal shelters here for instance have to import puppies and kittens for adoptions from more backward places where people don't spay and neuter their pets like they do here."
3076,163913093,Gregory Clark,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,9 Oct,Backwards? Where are those places?
3077,163913093,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,8 Oct,"I can tell you I see them ALL the time since I've moved here about a year ago. Some have collars, some don't, but they all look well kept and not feral."
3078,163913093,Carl Horwitz,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,30w,"They're normal... as are Nextdoor posts about them, fireworks, stolen bikes, dogs off leash, lost dogs as well as unlocked cars being ""broken into.""(edited)"
3079,163913093,Rick and Cathy Reynolds,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,8 Oct,"We've had 3 cats in the past, all outdoor.  One disappeared after a few months and two lived long and healthy lives.  None were de-clawed for their own protection.  Currently there are about 6 roaming our neighborhood during the day."
3080,163913093,Keegan Perkins,‚Ä¢ Central Park,30w,"I think some people haven‚Äôt had cats, and are trying to be helpful, thinking a cat may be lost. They‚Äôre different than dogs. That said, I‚Äôm sure some cats shouldn‚Äôt go outside and do get lost, wander too far, become too independent, or find themselves in trouble. There‚Äôs a lot that can happen to any pet outside.(edited)"
3081,163913093,Kate Killin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,30w,"I have an indoor cat and sometimes he tries to bolt outside. Thankfully we have always caught him but if he were to run away I would be devastated to think people would just assume he was an outdoor cat and not check try to catch him. Also, outdoor cats are a threat to wild birds, which already are dying at a high rate. Also, its technically a violation of Denver Animal Code to have an outside cat because you do not have control of your animal if it's free roaming.(edited)"
3082,163913093,Cara Tedeschi,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,9 Oct,So Denver Animal Control have to pick up a cat and bring it in? Or  What about if there is a collar?
3083,163913093,Claire Warnes,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,9 Oct,I‚Äôm from the UK and before moving to NY had never heard of ‚Äòindoor‚Äô cats!
3084,163913093,James Scott,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,30w,Thank you! Cats are intelligent. They don't need to be prisoners of their people.(edited)
3085,163913093,James Scott,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Oct,"Cats are independant intelligent creatures. They do great outdoors. They socialize with other cats & people. I know some cats are incapable of this, but most cats are happier & healthier, much like humans, when they can be active outdoors. If you think outdoor cats are a problem, I think you are a problem."
3086,163913093,James Scott,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Oct,"Not you personally Lindsey, the folks complaining on here constantly"
3087,163913093,Jessie Hardy,‚Ä¢ Hale,9 Oct,I have an outdoor cat. Or indoor/outdoor. She likes to roam during parts of the day and especially between 3-5 am. I‚Äôve gotten her 5 collars and she‚Äôs lost them all. She‚Äôs got her claws. When I tried to keep

3090,163913093,Allen Friedman,‚Ä¢ Central Park,9 Oct,We don't own any cats but there are a couple of outdoor cats in our neighborhood.  Nothing works better to keep the mice away.
3091,163913093,Justine Meyers,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,9 Oct,I personally think it depends on the areas. My cat is an indoor cat unless I am outside with him to make sure he‚Äôs safe - that being said I live in an apartment and near a very busy intersection.. but when I lived in a more rural area my cat had access to indoors and outdoors and generally didn‚Äôt go to far.
3092,163913093,Nora Weiker,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,9 Oct,"In Brevard CTY fla. there is a large Area between the port and the Hosp. The county  began breeding tux cats. There are at least close to 1000. They have vet care,    fed 2x daily, shelters...it is a sight to see.! N"
3093,163913093,Shannon Burton,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Oct,"People worry too much.  I grew up in Estes Park and all of our cats were outdoor cats living in the mountains.  They were fine and lived happy long lives. My Mom's most current cat died at 20 the one before that was 18.  If i was a cat I would much rather take the risk and enjoy life and catch mice, then go stir crazy staying inside all the time."
3094,163913093,Linda Hendrick,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,9 Oct,"Until recently, I never had indoor cats. But about about 3 years ago, I adopted an 8-year old cat. My other (18-year old) cat would go out in my fenced backyard and sun himself, but never left the yard. The newer 8-year old jumped the 8' fence daily, but jumped it again to get back in the house until . . . the day he didn't and was gone 5 days. Upon his return, the vet bill for his injured leg was almost $500. He was never allowed outside again, and neither was the kitten I adopted 3 years ago. They both appear quite happy to stay indoors."
3095,163913093,Shannon Burton,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Oct,"People jump to conclusions when they see animals.  Like this guy thinks he is ""rescuing"" puppies, and the vet tells the guy to return the litter of pups back to where he took them because they are fox cubs and he took them from thier Mother.  ü§¶"
3096,163913093,Dakota Mancillas,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,30w,"Depends on where in Denver I guess, my cat growing up didn‚Äôt like being inside but he liked being bad and beating up the neighbors dog & cats so we tried to keep him inside lol but mainly he went outside & came back home whenever he pleased (before he started being bad)(edited)"
3097,163913093,shannon quillian,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Oct,I can‚Äôt really add cuz I have had many cats and keep them indoors But last winter there was a cat that came to my backdoor and looked cold and hungry. It was snowing. I felt sorry for it and fed it and built a makeshift shelter out of boxes and blankets only to find out later that it belonged to the lady across the alleyway.
3098,163913093,Kacey Mathews,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,9 Oct,"No, they‚Äôre not. I volunteer at Denver Dumb Friends League & they‚Äôre always getting in lost cats. They post pictures of all the lost & found cats on their website."
3099,163913093,Oakley Cobb,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,9 Oct,I think that it is becoming more rare as people become aware of the negative impact that outdoor cats have on songbird populations.
3100,163913093,Debbie Alther,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Oct,Exactly what I was going to say. I love cats and song birds which is why when I had cats they were always indoors.
3101,163913093,Judith Holland,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Oct,I agree that the dangers of preditors to cats should keep them inside. There are also diseases like feline HIV among others that can kill them.
3102,161523641,Michael Backstrom,‚Ä¢ Skyland,15 Sep,If they are useable donate
3103,161523641,Kim LaClair,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,15 Sep,ARC donation off E Colfax?
3104,161523641,Andrea O'Brien,‚Ä¢ City Park,15 Sep,If they‚Äôre in bad shape put them in the alley on the next scheduled day for extra trash pick up by the city.  There is no charge.
3105,161523641,Lisa Ryckman,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Sep,"If they‚Äôre in decent shape, post them on nextdoor or Craigslist under free stuff. They‚Äôll be gone in a flash."

3108,161523641,Ingrid Underwood,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Sep,"If the frame is in decent shape, someone could reupholster them.  It is sometimes cheaper to reupholster than to buy new couches.   Otherwise, post them as free on Nextdoor, Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace and set in the alley or front yard with a free sign.  They will be picked up by someone!  Some of the donation places will pick up - some are free and some are for a fee.  You have to check their websites.  We had several desks and dressers and they were very selective about what they took and had to be small enough that ONE person could move it.  Some are not doing pickups at all due to Covid."
3109,160878572,Gaar Potter,‚Ä¢ Happy Canyon,9 Sep,I read somewhere that if I mail my Census Form...the Post Office might be too busy to get it to you by the deadline. Do you have any drop boxes?

3111,160878572,Leslie L.,‚Ä¢ Sunny Side Manitou,9 Sep,is there a way to confirm that the information was received? I filled the form out on line and yet a census worker came by our house last weekend......
3112,160878572,Suzanne S.,‚Ä¢ Struthers Ranch,9 Sep,"There are a couple of reasons why a worker stopped by.. might be something very minor, checking on a non responsive neighbor."

3114,160878572,Mark Yaw,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,34w,"A Census taker with ID was out canvassing today.  I explained I had filed mine online months ago. She started asking direct questions about my neighbors. This is not Russia, I respect my neighbors' privacy, and I consider this an unwelcome intrusion. Scary stuff.(edited)"

I‚Äôm baffled by people‚Äôs negative reactions on census. Don‚Äôt you want your neighbors to be counted as well as yourself?
3116,160878572,Debbie W.,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,9 Sep,I sent mine in way back before the lockdown and I have received many things in the mail saying it‚Äôs the law to respond to the census as well as calls . Then when you call the number it says there is no way to verify they received it .
3117,160878572,Halyna N.,‚Ä¢ Peterson Road,10 Sep,The mass mailers are just that. It's cheaper to send out to everyone than to check who already responded.

3123,160878572,Roxie M S.,‚Ä¢ Harvest Ridge,9 Sep,"They can not see our comments, we have asked them to close the posts, obviously a ""no go"" or hit and miss on that subject.  I will monitor for improper posts as best as possible."
3124,160878572,Jeffrey Sturman,‚Ä¢ CBD,9 Sep,Should I complete the census twice like the pres said I should vote twice?
3125,160878572,Gayle N.,‚Ä¢ Upper Skyway,9 Sep,You are kidding. Lets have respect. Please! President Trump was just asking you to make sure your vote was counted and not thrown out by the Democrats!!!
3126,160878572,Robin Lewison,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,34w,"Somehow some folks here don't understand that the U.S. Census began shortly after President Washington took office. We are Americans and need to be counted. Don't make this institution into something political. Think of participating in the Census as important as voting, except that it only happens every ten years. Come on, you can do this successfully 5 times in your adult life without complaining, can't you?(edited)"
3127,160878572,Deon G.,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,10 Sep,"Well said. I have worked every census since college, and you‚Äôre right ‚Äì people don‚Äôt understand how critical a complete count is. It is so much more than redistricting, and those who are typically undercounted go without the services they need."

3130,160878572,Kendra G.,‚Ä¢ Harvey Park,10 Sep,Lynn L. What does MAGA even mean? What time in America are Trump supporters trying to return to? I‚Äôm asking out of curiosity because no one has ever been able to give me an answer.
3131,160878572,Paul M.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,9 Sep,"What have the census workers been doing all summer?  They have had five months to visit all non-responding addresses in their assigned areas.  Or perhaps someone at the office is exceptionally slow to update the outstanding address list?  Either way, this seems like a management incompetence issue so typical of government operations."
3132,160878572,Casey E.,‚Ä¢ Cragmor,10 Sep,They purposely wait to allow people time to voluntarily complete the census. That info is available to you.
3133,160878572,Ann H.,‚Ä¢ Jackson Creek,10 Sep,I thought this forum was for real people who live here
3134,160878572,Robin Lewison,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,10 Sep,I am real and I do live here.

3136,160878572,Mary F.,‚Ä¢ Overland,10 Sep,"I did my census a long time ago & pretty much stay to myself, but the census taker decided, no matter how many times I told them I don't talk to most of my neighbors, still asked me questions on my neighbors???? WTH???? When I say I don't know, then I DON'T KNOW!!!"
3137,160878572,Lynn Buschhoff,‚Ä¢ Union Station,10 Sep,"I believe you. As David Brooks notes in The Second Mountain, one of the victims of the past three decades of urban planning is the community. It used to be the community that taught , nourished and supported each other. Now we live in isolation and have to turn to government and ngo's for community. It is no wonder you don,t know your community, especially during a pandemic.  Judging from the previous snarky comments in this thread, it is going to take a lot of forgiveness before we can reweave a strong sense of community in this country. At least people are talking , though I wish they weren,t so busy playing the blame game."
3138,160878572,Ruth P.,‚Ä¢ Palmer Park,10 Sep,It makes me sad that something so important as the Census which determines how federal monies and representation of the people has to become so political.  You are asked a few simple questions.  What are you trying to hide?
3139,160878572,Laura E.,‚Ä¢ Security,10 Sep,"Even if I do know anything about my neighbors, I'm not telling anyone.  That is my neighbor's business, not mine."
3140,160878572,Dena Pisciotte,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,10 Sep,"It's nothing personal. This is a constitutional mandate. It's like, how many people live there and things like that. It helps them be counted so there are enough roads and bridges and schools. Nobody is coming for them in the night or anything."
3141,160878572,Ossie R.,‚Ä¢ Alamo Placita,10 Sep,I don't recall questions about my neighbors
3142,160878572,Laura H.,‚Ä¢ Jackson Creek,10 Sep,If they can't get a hold of someone they then go to their neighbors to at least get a head count of how many were living in the residents on April 1. My neighbor was out of town due to his father in law being sick then passing away.  So i had someone knocking on my door to get their info.
3143,160878572,Rosie B.,‚Ä¢ Old Colorado City,34w,I called the Regional Census office in Dallas and spoke with a very nice lady.  she said the enumerators (census takers) are allowed to ask certain questions about your neighbors if they cannot get in touch with them.  She suggested to call our local office if you have any questions - 719-257-5049.  I also discussed the problems with people posting comments and using this as a political forum - Again - she suggested calling the local office.(edited)

Please correct me if I'm wrong about Kashmann's support, but who needs a ""representative"" who wants to destroy our beloved neighborhood?!"
3148,157553148,Linda Tegtmeier,‚Ä¢ Bonnie Brae,9 Aug,"That's what I'm thinking, too, Holly! I worked my tail off to pay for my little BB home...now in my retirement, I may get to sit on my porch and watch the men pee off the porch of neighbor homes because there aren't enough (working) bathrooms in their too-high-occupancy homes to accomodate the needs of the number of occupants!"
3149,157553148,Sheila Ritter,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,10 Aug,"This is a perfect example of ""not in my backyard"". You don't want homeless shelters in the neighborhood yet seem to be upset with homeless in tents along the creek and alleyways. The tents are the problem. No place to go to the bathroom, throw away garbage, bathe.... Why not open a shelter and get rid of the eyesore? Instead of complaining about people's lives, why not build more low income housing? Instead of curtailing people's rights to help their families, figure out a way to help? I understand the lowered housing concerns but please, let's remember that these are human beings we are talking about."
3150,157553148,Alecia Zunker,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,10 Aug,Agreed ;)

3162,157553148,Bill Tanner,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,38w,From Denver INC [Inter-Neighborhood Co-operation] Delegate meeting. Delegates represent various Denver Neighborhoods [RNOs]:
3163,157553148,Angie H.,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,15 Aug,Do we have a breakdown of the votes by RNO?
3164,157553148,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,38w,I see Mari has left the conversation.  Rightfully so since she gave no hard facts and did nothing more than accuse law abiding citizens of being racists.  It's an old accusation especially when most lawn signs in my area proclaim their support of BLM. Not wanting homeless encampments on our streets and ex -convicts piled into our neighborhoods doesn't make us racists!  If it does then our freedom of speech under the first amendment of our US Constitution is doomed. We all have a right to speech and to live with peace and quiet in our neighborhoods.  Our government MUST figure out a plan to house the homeless many of whom they created with their hands off approach to life. Once again  they're taking the easy way out by putting the burden on us and then calling us racist.(edited)
3165,157553148,Mari Floyd,‚Ä¢ Hale,16 Aug,"I actually have not left this wonderful debate, you said you were muting me, but I stand on my experiences as hard facts unlike you, you have NO viable experience living in a community that housed homeless or ex-cons. So you are the one that needs a lesson in hard facts. I‚Äôve called it how you put it out there.... discrimination and discrimination is not just about being racist (just like a racist), how ignorant of you, but it‚Äôs the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people on the grounds of race, age, income status, gender or sex, just to name a few."
3166,157553148,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,38w,"OK Mari, here are some facts that I don't usually reveal because I know what I am talking about. I have no need to brag.  I have paid someone's rent for 3 months, I contribute to 6 non-profits, I work with low-income seniors helping them stay safe in their homes, I work with the homeless bringing them things I own and know they need without telling them they came from me to help them get to a better place and the next level in their lives. AND I am not white, but I live in this beautiful community that I worked to own a home in and will not see it destroyed by overreaching unregulated zoning. You need to stop calling good people racist and discriminatory when we are actually fighting this clearly insane zoning stealth plan set in place by the city to shirk their responsibility for the current state of affairs and not doing the right thing to repair it.(edited)"
3167,157553148,Eric Godoy,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,38w,As long as they don‚Äôt live next to you...amirite? Your skin color don‚Äôt matter...you can still be a NIMBY. Classism is not bound by color. Nor the Savior Complex.(edited)
3168,157553148,Mari Floyd,‚Ä¢ Hale,16 Aug,Evidently you do! Give it a rest & get your life Anna! You are discriminating under the plain & simple definition of discrimination.... NOW THATS FACTS!!!! Have a blessed day

3171,157553148,Mari Floyd,‚Ä¢ Hale,16 Aug,"If you‚Äôre going to address me you need to address everyone (Anna & Sara) Stephen, don‚Äôt ever make the mistake of trying to put me in my place again! I said my position on the matter and it won‚Äôt change. Stating the fact that this is housing discrimination is not name calling. Yet, I was called stupid & ignorant among other things, but I don‚Äôt see you saying anything to Sara or Anna.....but guess what I‚Äôm not easily offended b/c I know I‚Äôm not. You‚Äôre offended and find the need to address it because maybe you are? I will state exactly what is being done here is discriminating against people of a different class. Which is exactly what was done in the 50‚Äôs & 60‚Äôs to black American when whites thought they would bring down the value of their neighborhoods. So now what is the difference here? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! I call it how I see it & I oppose any & ALL kinds of discrimination and I will stand by that. This is housing discrimination against the poor & less fortunate."
3172,157553148,Mari Floyd,‚Ä¢ Hale,16 Aug,"Anna McCaffery look in the mirror you called me stupid & ignorant among other things. Am I not a good person b/c I want to make sure EVERYONE has a right to non- discriminatory housing? I do have a savior complex because I am a SERVANT of the SAVIOR & I‚Äôm proud of it!!!!! This is the SAME thing that was done in the 50‚Äôs & 60‚Äôs to keep Black people out of white neighborhoods. They were redlined because whites thought they would bring down the value of the neighborhood we‚Äôre all drug addicts, would kill, & rape their families too. Now the same exact thing is being done to those that don‚Äôt have enough $ but through the resources design to help them & you want to keep them way because you think they are all drug addicts, killers, rapist, & even after serving their time in jail or trying to escape an abusive spouse they don‚Äôt deserve to be in our neighborhood because they are poor and less fortunate. Your promoting housing discrimination against the poor and less fortunate, I really hope you feel GREAT about yourself."
3173,157553148,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,16 Aug,"I lived right here in the 50's and 60's. We got along fine then as well. Thank God we have good people standing up for those who need it, not you."

3175,157553148,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,38w,You are not standing up for anyone. You just want trouble. We will continue to save our city. You might want to go back to English class.(edited)

3177,157553148,Christopher Neuman,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,18 Aug,So from reading the text amendment it sounds like the main idea regarding homeless/halfway house is to spread the places around the city rather than try to cluster them all into a small blighted area.
3178,157553148,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,18 Aug,They need to build new low-income housing. There is plenty of open land in Denver.

3257,156084749,Rob & Stacy Parker,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Jul,"Thanks Jill. To add on, the proposed rule change is now a sliding scale from 5-10 unrelated adults, based on dwelling size. (2,600 sq foot house for 10 unrelated adults.)"
3258,156084749,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,27 Jul,The primary thrust of this initiative is to disperse homeless shelters and community corrections throughout Denver neighborhoods.
3259,156084749,Rob & Stacy Parker,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Jul,"Nancy, do you have a link to these documents? They‚Äôd be interesting to read."
3260,156084749,Vicki Kelley,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Jul,THANK YOU NANCY!
3261,156084749,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,27 Jul,"Members of GLAC notice the ‚Äúyellow‚Äù members, notice the non-residents"
3262,156084749,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,27 Jul,"Notice the homeless organizations, the community corrections members and please take the time to listen to the above Steffan Tubbs radio interview above!"
3263,156084749,Rob & Stacy Parker,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Jul,I found this to be informative. It looks like all front range cities are 5 or less unrelated adults.
3264,156084749,Cynthia Ivers,‚Ä¢ Lowry,30 Jul,But no limit on children or related people.
3265,156084749,Laura Jones-McDowell,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Jul,"All of you in your secure little bubbles of privilege make me embarrassed for the neighborhood. Let me guess, none of you are racist or classist, right? Have you been wondering to yourselves, ""just what is all that commotion about downtown? Why are they so angry?"" Or are you pleased with yourselves because you taped a ""Black Lives Matter"" sign in the window of your lovely 3,500sf refuge? WWJD btw?  Hopefully whoever you answer to is not as disgusted."
3266,156084749,Laura Jones-McDowell,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Jul,As does your reply Ray.
3267,156084749,Tina Davis,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Jul,"I have commented previously and feel that nothing has been done to address my and other residents concerns about the impacts on neighbors and neighborhoods of this proposal.  It seems like the drafts are not going to change their views, so I suggest also making your views known to city council if you are not happy with the current draft since they will be voting on it."
3268,156084749,Laura Jones-McDowell,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Jul,"I feel like sixteen is an exaggeration.  I am actually a homeowner as well as a renter, not that this is your business. It sounds like you would prefer living in an even more exclusive neighborhood, one that has no apartment buildings at all. It's all in who one associates with I suppose. I know plenty of people who dream of having a property where they could welcome many others. It's a cultural thing I believe. And a class thing. The more some have, the greedier and more possessive they become."
3269,156084749,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Jul,"Laura, we worked for what we have. Others need to do the same."
3270,156084749,Vicki Kelley,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Jul,"Laura Jones-McDowell - ""bubble of priviledge""  What the heck is that?  My husband and I bought our home in 2003.  A home NOBODY wanted that was on the market for over a year because it needed so much work.  17 years later we are still fixing/updating. We did as much of the work ourselves as we could because we could not afford to pay someone, all the while raising 2 kids and working FT.  I do not care if someone is black/white/brown/orange/striped/gay/straight/or from Pluto.  We have gay couples, gay/with kids, black, white, Hispanic, single, married, divorced, all on my block.  Our differences unite us in the commonality that we all chose this neighborhood and single family homes. If you want something work for it.  It didn't kill us to do it why should it be different for anyone else?"
3271,156084749,Colin Griffith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Jul,"You were able to afford a house to begin with, so, yes, privilege."
3272,156084749,Colin Griffith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Jul,Denver loves to be progressive until it comes to having to change the way you live even the slightest amount so that other people can have access to basic resources.
3273,156084749,Colin Griffith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Jul,"Ray Dude, you're embarrassing yourself. This isn't about luxury, and you know it. It's about making housing more accessible so that we have fewer unhoused people and more affordable rents. Denver is growing, and if you want to keep reaping the economic rewards of that growth (which you are, whether you consciously realize it or not), you can't keep pricing people out of living here."
3274,156084749,Kathryn Studer,‚Ä¢ Lowry,27 Jul,Much easier to do this than create affordable housing. Ridiculous üò° leave it to govt to take the easy way out.
3275,156084749,Tina Davis,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Jul,I agree with you. The city is making this  ill-conceived zoning change rather than doing something about affordable housing that will actually work. The other ineffectual thing they want to do is allow tiny houses in people‚Äôs yard with no restrictions on how close they can be to neighbors. It is in the east Central Plan. Most of those will end up as Air BnBs.
3276,156084749,Vibeke Senn,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,28 Jul,"Tina Davis  , I do agree that they should close the loopholes in the zoning laws"
3277,156084749,Sandi Heller,‚Ä¢ Hale,27 Jul,Vicki Kelley We haven‚Äôt been exposed to a pandemic causing such an economic impact in the last 100 years.
3278,156084749,Sandi Heller,‚Ä¢ Hale,27 Jul,Would you feel better with more homeless folks?
3279,156084749,Laura Ellerby,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,27 Jul,"Ray Colaiano   Exactly, Ray!"
3280,162690330,Joseph Herrera,‚Ä¢ Harkness Heights,28 Sep,"Its about time, they  ( food ordering company's) are killing the struggling restaurants."
3281,162690330,Jeff K.,‚Ä¢ Windsor East,28 Sep,How are these companies hurting the restaurants? Every meal delivered is another meal they sold and may not have sold without the delivery service.
3282,162690330,KR C.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,32w,Jeff Krump Charging them higher fees to use these delivery companies(edited)
3283,162690330,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,28 Sep,"so, which council members going to side with the delivery companies?"
3284,162690330,Jeff K.,‚Ä¢ Windsor East,28 Sep,This is not the role of government. City council has enough on their plate. Deal with the homeless problem or the protestors who are damaging property. No restaurant nor patron is forced to use the delivery service.  If the price is too much people and restaurants will quit using the service.
3285,162690330,Cynthia Ivers,‚Ä¢ Lowry,29 Sep,Should be supply and demand. This is not the role of govt.
3286,162690330,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,29 Sep,the city council disagrees with you
3287,162690330,KR C.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,29 Sep,CJ S. They may disagree. But city council makes too many decisions the people should be making and that they don‚Äôt even put out for public comment
3288,162690330,Mike Young,‚Ä¢ Krisana Park,29 Sep,"should be interesting- grubhub, doordash and uber all lose money on food deliveries right now"
3289,162690330,Jeff K.,‚Ä¢ Windsor East,1 Oct,Why do they continue to do busiess?
3290,178924410,Heidi Kabir,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,3 Mar,Why would a person leave Paradise?? :) Which island did you live on? I love Kauai!

3317,164947169,Laurie Jensen,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,18 Oct,I‚Äôm so sorry for this mother and daughter. I totally agree that the mental heal system is totally broken. In addition to that some mental health conditions are so bad that present science and treatment are unable to help. I really hope that she‚Äôs okay and will be able to reach out for help.
3318,164947169,Kirsten Wakefield,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,18 Oct,"Thank you Laurie!!! We are so blessed to have Kat back!!! She‚Äôs got a huge loving family, a village to raise her... my hope is that we find a viable treatment plan Kat can adhere to! It‚Äôs so hard w/people suffering w/certain pathologies, who don‚Äôt want to medicate their condition, cuz they feel it dulls their normal state of being. It‚Äôs even harder w/sufferers of schizophrenia, when the voices are telling them not to take meds, or trust the people trying to help by giving them medication...."
3319,164947169,Lynn Zwerdlinger,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,18 Oct,Thank you for the update.  Been thinking about all of you and mostly her children.  Greatest news today!

3321,164947169,Jan Holland-Beachley,‚Ä¢ Lowry,29w,"In response to what you and Kat's mom and wanted us to know about Kat not being the typical homeless person...l want to raise the issue about some of the myths about ""who are the homeless"". Many homeless persons are not ""addicts and alcoholics"". They are not ""lazy"", not ""help-rejecting"", and just like Kat, they have families who are trying to support them, and they have severe mental illnesses.  "
3322,164947169,Kirsten Wakefield,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,19 Oct,"I also wanted to thank you for referring me to CAMI; and will definitely look into their support groups for Kat, and others I know!!!"

3330,166409310,Jane Skarka,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,1 Nov,I could probably get both items at the same time.

3339,182115487,Lisa Bice,‚Ä¢ City Park,3 Apr,"Stephanie, be patient and be prepared to be checking websites often. Have a photo of your insurance card ready if you have one (both front and back) as some sites require you to upload while doing the initial paperwork.  Appointments fill very quickly when they become available. I got on several wait lists and got notification through HealthOne last weekend that they had open appointments. I had my first dose yesterday. Drive through was quick and efficient. I was able to get my husband an appointment at a Walmart. We are both in the previous wave- 50+ don‚Äôt get discouraged, you will be able to share your antibodies soon!"
3340,182115487,Ellen Reath,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 Apr,You can see open appointments on vaccinespotter.org. Keep checking !

3347,154773432,Lynn Stubbart,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Jul,Also check out the ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù encampment around the school on 13th & 14th.  They‚Äôre sporting some pretty expensive bikes for BEING homeless!

3356,157119361,David Beattie,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,5 Aug,Bureaucrats with visions of glory and no sense of economic realism. There‚Äôs a reason ALL of the airlines were against it.

3358,157119361,Brad Greenwell,‚Ä¢ Cinnimon Courtyard,10 Aug,Maybe they could sell some of the creepy artwork that adorns the walls or even Blucifer himself to raise some cash.
3359,157119361,Brad Wood,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NE,5 Aug,waste of money to begin with. think of how many homeless could get services with that money.
3360,157119361,Jeffrey Sturman,‚Ä¢ CBD,6 Aug,Short-term thinking if you handicap one of the largest economic drivers. Like not wanting to renovate 16th St.
3361,157119361,Brad Wood,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NE,6 Aug,Jeffrey Sturman the airport would have continued being an economic driver without the face-lift.
3362,157119361,Andy R.,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NW,6 Aug,I think they will be ok. Just like Vegas üòú

3381,171120988,Sharon N.,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,17 Dec,Because then they would have to give a good reason for closing restaurants and churches

3388,171120988,Sharon kay,‚Ä¢ Berkeley-Regis,17 Dec,"So sad...I went Christmas shopping this evening at Burlington coat factory.   Stood in line with 60 other people to buy a gift.  Inside a enclosed building...not a restaurant, or a church or a grocery store.  I felt uncomfortable not everyone was practicing social distancing.  So it appears we are not smart enough to figure out....social distancing is what keeps people out of the hospital‚Äôs.  I will not be shopping at any more stores with hundreds of people.  This Christmas Eve our family will be playing a game called bingoüòÄ. On this thing called Zoom.  Instead of dinning with 15 family members there will be a family of 3.  What are you doing for Christmas?"

3393,171120988,Steve Paranawski,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,18 Dec,Ken L. they're not dying outside sledding and one's chances of contracting the virus outside are slim to none.  Maybe we can all play this card and stop shoveling our walks (which I'm sure the City of Denver would appreciate) due to the possibility of someone becoming infected (either me or the walker(s)) by just passing by while I shovel snow - this is absolutely ridiculous.

3408,174547564,Maggie Reyes Leczinski,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,22 Jan,That stinks! We had a car abandoned in front of our house and I went to my neighbors to see if it was theirs. I even posted the car on here.  I don‚Äôt have an answer as to why there was a lack of effort but agree this could have been handled better.
3409,174547564,Jamie Simpson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,22 Jan,"Thanks I get it no one likes cars just sitting around and we would of happily moved it into the driveway, just wish we knew. Thanks for being a good neighbor!!"
3410,174547564,Steve Kregstein,‚Ä¢ Cherry - Leetsdale,22 Jan,Sorry to hear this. Hope the towing and ‚Äúrescue‚Äù fee weren‚Äôt onerous
3411,174547564,Jamie Simpson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,22 Jan,"It‚Äôs not in the system yet so we will see, I hope not either. I think when we show the medical records that he had COVID maybe they will wave some fees ü§û"
3412,174547564,Paul Paris,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,15w,"Recently, I had two flat tires, with expired plates. I taped a note to my window with my phone number asking that it not get towed. A week later, I was able to afford to tow it to my garage. I felt lucky, I guess the note worked.(edited)"
3413,174547564,Jamie Simpson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,22 Jan,"I will remember that from now on!! Good tip, thank you"
3414,174547564,Tree Wallace,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,22 Jan,How long did it sit there without moving?  The city might have just had it towed since there is a limit on how long a car can sit on a street without being moved.  Hope ur friend is better & so sorry this happened!

3417,174547564,Jamie Simpson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,22 Jan,Thanks all for letting me vent!! He got his car and total it was $220 with the tow and the ticket so not horrible but for someone that used all their sick bank after being out of work for almost 3 weeks he was pretty stressed out. Luckily he allowed me to split the bill with him so he didn‚Äôt have to bare all the cost. Like I side before I just wish someone knocked on my door or left a note that it bothered them and I would of happily put it in the driveway. Hopefully my friends and family don‚Äôt have to leave their cars with me anymore but now I know to leave a note on the window!!

3422,174547564,Dani Tyler,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,22 Jan,"How do you know someone called and reported it and it wasn't just the city? There have been a lot of street sweepers, utility workers, tree trimmers working around the neighborhood."
3423,174547564,Jamie Simpson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,24 Jan,The police officer told me it was reported
3424,174547564,Lontine Chavez,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,22 Jan,Definitely not good ‚ÄúCarma ‚Äú for your neighbor
3425,174547564,Melody Hodges,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,22 Jan,"There have been a couple of stories on Ch. 7 about predatory towing.  There is a limit to what tow companies can charge but several are apparently ignoring that and charging waaay too much.  Be careful and maybe contact Ch. 7 for help if you have issues.  They've gotten the Governor's office involved since the towing companies are blatantly breaking the law.  One victim even sued and won yet the towing company still won't return their car as per ordered by the court, saying they plan to appeal.  It's a racket."
3426,174547564,Stephanie Two Eagles,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,22 Jan,the governor mentioned during his press conference last week that the city is not towing for expired plates (policy since april due to covid).  he asked that any predatory towing be reported.
3427,174547564,Charras S.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Jan,That‚Äôs messed us that‚Äôs gonna make things worse in situations.
3428,174547564,Joshua Manuel,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,23 Jan,I've had 2 cars towed in last month. These guys are definitely on the hunt lately!! Mine was bc of license plate stickers. Tow truck companies DO NOT CARE!! ESPECIALLY DOWNTOWN!!! THATS HOW THEY PAD THEIR POCKETS!!! $350 each tow for me!
3429,174547564,Melody Hodges,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Jan,You need to report it.  Call the Governor's office first and they'll direct you.  They're not supposed to be towing for expired stickers and $350 is above the limit they're allowed to charge.
3430,174547564,Gretchen Gilliland,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,23 Jan,"Last year a car was parked in front of our house for a month, when I finally reported it. Turned out it had been stolen and the owners didn't know where it was. So, after three weeks maybe someone called it in trying to do the right thing? Or a car without plates could have just been towed by the city without a call?"
3431,174547564,Charras S.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Jan,Sorry to hear that but was the car fully bought? Any payment?
3432,174547564,Jamie Simpson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,24 Jan,"Yeah it was bought and he makes payments on it, just bad timing around when he got sick and his temporary plates expiring"
3433,174547564,Chad Hinshaw,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,23 Jan,"Good reason to get to know your neighbors, as if your scenario was the case here, if Jaime‚Äôs neighbors had simply asked it would have been easily explained and she could have taken action. Seems like the ‚Äúright thing to do‚Äù is to try to talk to your neighbors before you take an issue to the city."
3434,174547564,Zack Westlie,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Jan,"I live in an apartment complex and the owners have a tow truck come through every night looking for that $$$. My car has been towed twice despite the parking permit being displayed on the front windshield. Their excuse was ""it was dark"" so they couldn't see it. I had to take an Uber all the way across town to get it. Not one ""sorry"" from anyone. When I woke up and my car was gone, I was shure it was stolen. BTW, this was a Deerwoods manged property so fair warning. P. S. All my tags and everything else were in order."
3435,174547564,Marisa Baldwin,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,23 Jan,"If that spot is part of your lease, they can't tow you.  You might have actionable options."
3436,174547564,Zack Westlie,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Jan,"For sure. I'm sure they have an agreement where they get cash for every car towed, but as it's private property, I don't know what recourse I have."
3437,174547564,Marisa Baldwin,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,23 Jan,"If you pay for parking, you essentially own that space.  There may be conditions like your car description and plate number.  It would be the same as if they came into your apartment and took something."

3440,174547564,Jamie Simpson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,24 Jan,"The officer told me is was reported, I live on a very quite street quite a ways away from anywhere the city would patrol"
3441,174547564,Marisa Baldwin,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,24 Jan,Leave it to the City/State to shut down the ability to renew or get plates and/or tags and then penalize for not doing so.  Amazing.  Not surprising.
3442,174547564,Cathlene S.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,24 Jan,"The reason the neighborhood‚Äôs are now doing it is because the guy that puts out signs saying I buy kick car‚Äôs has been parking them all over and parting them out on the street. And another reason is that is the only way to locate abandoned stolen cars. If you don‚Äôt know the ordnance , contact code Inforcement and have them drop off a copy of the ordinances."

3450,161279443,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Sep,That looks like the same kitty that was posted from Detroit and Colfax.  If it‚Äôs still there I would take it to a shelter before it gets hit.

3503,178532353,Michael Stock,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,We had a prowler on detroit between 11th and 12th the night before . Footsteps in the back yard but they did  not break into house or garage
3504,178532353,Audrey Williams,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,"Maybe the same guy. They collected clothes he discarded in the alley (saw footage of him helping himself to a coat, boots too in neighbors home) so they are hoping for DNA samples of this person"
3505,178532353,Simon Lofts,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,27 Feb,This sort of thing is disturbing on many levels.
3506,178532353,Audrey Williams,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,Right?! And grabbed a bottle of vodka on the way out.
3507,178532353,Meredith Coors,‚Ä¢ Country Club,27 Feb,"We had someone break into our home a few (3?) years ago and they used our reusable grocery bags to pack up food from our fridge, freezer and pantry (he only took gf foods ü§£) as well as take winter clothing and a bike. He left it all in our yard when the police arrived and was caught 18 months later using DNA on a hat he left behind - he was already in jail for 7 other burglaries and they added to his sentence for our home."
3508,178532353,Audrey Williams,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,Wow. These people are brazen. That‚Äôs pretty incredible that he packed up your food to-go.
3509,178532353,Tracy Killian,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,"I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you guys! We have had our cars broken into, an attempted garage break in and a tire stolen off of my husbands car just over the past few years üòû"
3510,178532353,Audrey Williams,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,Thanks Tracy! It‚Äôs sad that we have to go through this.

3512,178532353,Steve Mast,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,"we're just north of you on Detroit and about 3 years ago had someone break into our garage in the middle of the night - took everything that had any value. . . . including credit cards that they used at 2 stores (on security camera).  Unfortunately, the police were worthless - neighborhood/neighbor awareness is our best bet!"
3513,178532353,Jodi Sewell,‚Ä¢ Country Club,27 Feb,"Oh, no, Audrey! I‚Äôm so sorry."
3514,178532353,Audrey Williams,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,"Yep! Sucks! This happened to three other homes on Clayton and Detroit, same alley!"
3515,178532353,Lisa Colletti,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,Hi Audrey. Our cameras didn‚Äôt pick up anything and our alarm didn‚Äôt get tripped. I saw another post on ND with footage that seemed like the same guy. 
3516,178532353,Audrey Williams,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,"Thanks Lisa! I think Randall‚Äôs garage got tossed too, right across from you. Bob just mentioned that Randall reported it too. That brings the total to five homes. I believe two houses down from you where the construction is going on, they have security cameras all over, so there might be something there."
3517,178532353,Audrey Williams,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,"Also Lisa if you find that footage again tag me! I‚Äôd love to see it, as I was able to view the Ring footage from the neighbor and would be able to tell if it‚Äôs the same guy"
3518,178532353,Lisa Colletti,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,This is a screenshot from the post I saw earlier today. I sent it to Margaret and she thinks it is the same guy.
3519,178532353,Audrey Williams,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,Yikes. Seems like he‚Äôs been at it for days.
3520,178532353,Lisa Colletti,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Feb,Audrey Williams yes that‚Äôs what I took away too. I‚Äôm relieved no one got hurt but really disturbed by how brazen and nervy he was.

3540,170555020,JR Ridings,‚Ä¢ Lowry,12 Dec,Lynn Milt lol... ‚ÄúmilSpec‚Äù and ‚Äúmilitary grade‚Äù is exactly what I said-lazy writing. MilSpec allows for a 3% failure rate...it probably would have been better to use a more scientific label to use

3542,170555020,Paul Furr,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Dec,"just splitting hairs there, seems to me"
3543,170555020,Patty Purves,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,12 Dec,"Ive seen several other restaurants construct ""outdoor"" patio areas that are essentially just extensions of the dining area, with thick, sealed plastic blocking all airflow.  The idea behind allowing patio dining was to provide a venue with airflow, not to create new, equally enclosed rooms."
3544,170555020,Paul Furr,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Dec,Not sure...but it looks like Esters on Onieda is using that setup...they do have one section open to air however
3545,170555020,Susan Hobbins,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,12 Dec,"Peoples‚Äô unmasked breath is trapped by an enclosed tent. Airflow must be through at least two open sides to cut the viral spread. Yes, watch that video."

3548,170555020,Joel Baker,‚Ä¢ City Park West,12 Dec,They broke the rules and created an enclosed space. The city didn‚Äôt just arbitrarily shut them down.
3549,170555020,Paul Furr,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,12 Dec,Absolutely not. This is public health
3550,170555020,Meg Garrido,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,12 Dec,The city did the right thing. We‚Äôre in the midst of a serious pandemic that is killing people. A fully tented patio might as well be indoor space if airflow is impeded.
3551,170555020,Maggie Reyes Leczinski,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,12 Dec,"Maybe it‚Äôs me but I value human lives over business. As someone who lost her mom during the pandemic, my thoughts are that you can rebuild a business but you can‚Äôt replace people. Larah, I hope you are just as outraged by the number of people who lost their lives to covid."
3552,170555020,Clyde Freeman,‚Ä¢ Lowry,12 Dec,"Yes. And with the information that was put out above, I guess she wants everything opened up and the pandemic to spread. The economy cannot function until we get control of the virus. She named things but opening everything up was the only thing she endorsed. It was and is very short sighted. Maybe her info comes from Fox News or Qanon or dump‚Äôs folks. Who knows. It is a very narrow look at a serious issue. I loved your answer."
3553,170555020,Peter Pryor,‚Ä¢ Lowry,13 Dec,You are not singing to the choir
3554,170555020,Hallie Loeb,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,13 Dec,"I too am unemployed due to the pandemic. I would not want a business to operate just so that people are employed at holiday time. BTW, the entire world does not celebrate xmas. Look at all the businesses that are open, and short staffed with hiring freezes. those employees are not happy to have to go to work and be exposed to a customer base who aren't practicing safe protocols."

3557,170555020,Joe Flynn,‚Ä¢ City Park West,13 Dec,"It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwithout warning‚Äù. If you violate public health orders, you get shutdown. They essentially created the indoors outside, so they shouldn‚Äôt be surprised that they got shut down (for all of one day).

3558,170555020,Ron Rutherford,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,13 Dec,Thank you for providing the phone numbers. I‚Äôll call both and thank them for following the science and not caving to the politicalization of public health that is killing more than 3000 people per day.

Its so easy for people to fling mud and gaslight and bully others when its not their own business, home and livelihoods that have been needlessly lost over this hysteria. Praying for you all. ‚ù§"
3562,170555020,MayMay McLellan,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Dec,You can support them by buying gift cards to be used once this isn't killing thousands a day. Your description of the responses is laughable considering it describes the projecting in your own response.
3563,170555020,Tiffany K.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,14 Dec,Thank god for Glendale.  Only city with any sense
3564,170555020,Paul Brown,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Dec,I think it's their Denver location but I'm 100% sure these sentences have never been uttered before and will never be uttered again :)
3565,163142587,Michelle Hattasch,‚Ä¢ City Park,27 Oct,"Hi there, I will be dropping off some socks today. Thanks for doing this!"
3566,155657139,Carolyn Haas,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,22 Jul,"What a colossal waste of money!  Why not put that money to use cleaning up downtown first?  As it is now, who in their right mind would want to be there?"
3567,155657139,Jeannine S.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,22 Jul,Absolutely! Or for schools which I read is legal and what they might have done! This is not the time to spend money on something like this
3568,155657139,Christine Shepherd,‚Ä¢ Five Points,24 Jul,Jeannine S. it's kind of like going to get your hair done while your house is on fire.
3569,155657139,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,22 Jul,"They may be showing a diplomatic way of changing the atmosphere of that area.  The Corona virus is going to leave a depressing atmosphere on this nation, on much of the world.  It'll take some time for things to bounce back.  The year 2023 is not really that far away, just around the corner when you think of all of the people, just in the greater Denver area, who will be suffering great financial loss, many whom will not recover, many who never recovered from 2009."
3570,155657139,Colin L.,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,22 Jul,That‚Äôs wishful thinking. The mall stretches for miles - won‚Äôt all be worked on at once. 
3571,155657139,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,41w,"Yes, I will not argue those points.  It is wishful thinking; as opposed to biting the bullet of accepting that there simply is no rhyme or reason for the indecision, and such decisions made, by the city, in current times.  The start date alone seems to point to creating a positive to look forward to, while looking away from a plethora of problems too wearisome to keep looking at, let alone make decisions to remedy.(edited)"
3572,155657139,Jeffrey Sturman,‚Ä¢ CBD,22 Jul,I'm glad they approved it and that local biz are funding it.
3573,155657139,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,22 Jul,"With all that is going on that has been a great detriment to local businesses, residents, & customers, it is a thing to look forward to, as we endure this really long and spasmodic pause from what has been normal life, to whatever degree we have been living it."
3574,155657139,Linda P.,‚Ä¢ Wellshire East,41w,"Watched the July 20 city council meeting and they go into great detail about why all but one council person decided to support the mall renovation.  They also explain why an editorial in the paper doesn't understand the situation under consideration.    Nothing is being cut by this vote from current school funding.  The 33 mil mentioned wouldn't necessarily go to the schools in any case if cut from the mall project. The state might reduce state funding to the schools if it did.  Without it, the mall renovation would likely be impossible for the next 10-20 years and other funding acquired from fed and other sources would almost certainly have to be returned to those sources and fought for again in years to come after it's already been hard fought & put in place now.  Needs and benefits were discussed.   Replay of the meeting is available through the city council website. It's a long meeting.  I believe discussion of this issue is the last agenda item. It's toward the end at any rate but it is a fairly long though interesting discussion.  Fast forward is available.  After listening, Denver Council's decision made a lot of sense to me.(edited)"
3575,155657139,John Franquemont,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NW,23 Jul,"This project has been in the works for a long time. Infrastructure projects like this have a lot of moving parts and once they‚Äôre in motion, it‚Äôs difficult to just stop them due to a recent event (covid-19). These improvements have been warranted for awhile now and once completed, this could very well change the dynamic of the mall and Lodo. With the mall being more pedestrian and restaurant friendly, more people will be attracted to come and check it out. Not to mention, they‚Äôre adding more mature foliage and green space, which is always a worth-while improvement."
3576,155657139,Ingrid K.,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,23 Jul,What they need to invest is more security around the mall and downtown areas!!

3579,155657139,Florence S.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,23 Jul,"The Denver Urban Renewal Authority declared this area blighted in order to  use Tax Incremental Funding (TIF) as a redevelopment tool. When TIF is used, all regular taxes are diverted to DURA (and the developer) for 25 years. This means that property tax revenues for schools are diverted, too."
3580,155657139,Nikki S.,‚Ä¢ Chaffee Park,23 Jul,Why are they spending money and city employees have to take furlough days????

3584,155657139,Dede d.,‚Ä¢ Baker,23 Jul,"I'd add to the comments here that narrow, bumpy pedestrian walkways create accessibility barriers for people with mobility issues."
3585,155657139,Pam Becker,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,23 Jul,I vote we use the money to find a different alternative to downtown tent town.
3586,155657139,Pam Becker,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,23 Jul,Maybe they want them wider for the tents though....
3587,155657139,Jami Horwitz,‚Ä¢ Whittier,24 Jul,"The City of Denver's response to the homeless situation is identical to Trumps's response to COVID-19. Denver passed the camping ban, then totally dropped the ball as homeless numbers sky rocketed.  Eight years of this.  Coming up with a Corona virus vaccine seems like it will be easier than coming up with solutions for homelessness in Denver."
3588,155657139,Pam Becker,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,24 Jul,"What‚Äôs crazy is that there are more places for the homeless right now than ever before.  The coliseum and local schools all opened up for them.  There are tons of organizations that are wanting to help, yet still the tent town grows!"

3591,155657139,Sara H.,‚Ä¢ Whampoa,29 Jul,The city needs to do something with all the homeless people downtown before they proceed with anything that is going to cost taxpayers more money.

I'm just scared with new more contagious strain that it shouldn't be the time to let more people gather.

Then it was an estimate to have a manageable tool to gauge. Now we know too much. The system that Summit County deployed is more practical, yet still flawed because of the tourism variable (personalities willing to travel, same as those who take risk). It does NOT DO SMALL BUSINESS any favors ...in fact, it presents them with a whack-a-mole false tease of they have to go back to lock down on Sunday (which they will if it goes over 10%>>>>and if it is 8% NOW......it is already over 10%).

Several people on this website have been discussing buying guns for protection because we have so much crime in the neighborhood lately.  Sorry, I should have realized someone would think I was serious.  Just a stupid joke. No worries."
3655,155678844,Heather Side,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills/Holly Ridge,22 Jul,A parade for all of the businesses lost? The people being evicted soon or the ones foreclosing on their homes? Or maybe it‚Äôs for the record unemployment in the state- will the roly poly Governor be there? Is it a parade for the record number of suicides in the state for the last 3 months? Or it must be for all the lonely people who can‚Äôt get together to worship. Just wondering WTF you think there is to celebrate?

3663,155678844,Shirley T.,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,23 Jul,What is MSM?  I like to know what is happening so I read and watch and listen to a variety of perspectives.  Fox shows video you won't see and interviews you won't hear anywhere else.  I wonder why?
3664,155678844,KR C.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,23 Jul,Mainstream media.  I have heard them minimize the riots frequently or not report on them at all.  Very few if at all reported on the riot Sunday at Civic Center Park attacking the pro police PEACEFUL protestors.  Some barely got away with their lives.
3665,155678844,KR C.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,23 Jul,"My hope is that the leaders in power will have the Capitol building cleaned and repaired as well as the buildings and businesses surrounding it.  Take care of the crime and hope that we can come to better and more positive solutions rather than what is going on in our city currently.  A neighborhood parade is nice, but there are bigger issues to solve and hope that there can be unity with various positive solutions."
3666,155678844,Shirley T.,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,23 Jul,When people  continue destroying property and attacking people who is going to come together with positive solutions and unity.  I am more realistic than that.  The longer this rioting goes on the more I am disliking this movement.  The value of the original mission has been lost.  Now it is just evil.
3667,155678844,Dee S.,‚Ä¢ Five Points,23 Jul,Perhaps the parade can showcase the location selected by each city council member for the homeless encampment in their District as requested by the mayor.

3670,165071361,Michael Ritter,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,19 Oct,They usually use a bent coat hanger or stiff wire to release the emergency lock on the garage door opener (that red handle).
3671,165071361,dick/barbara hopper,‚Ä¢ Country Club,19 Oct,You can disconnect that emergency pull so something (bent coat hanger for ex) can't be fished in thru the top of the garage door to access it.. but you also have to be aware that if you do this and need to get out of the garage in an emergency (and there is no other way but thru the garage door) you need to be able to access that emergency area so the garage door will go up--- you've gotten rid of the pull -    I think there was a Utube tutorial on it or perhaps someone on NDCC can tell you how to do this.  A side note:  Why bother with all these new bike lanes....seems everyone's bike is being stolen - LOL ...   I am sorry your bike was stolen...that sucks.
3672,165071361,Amy Leverson,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,20 Oct,They use the coat hanger from the alley through the top of the closed garage door opener to reach the red pull?

3683,165071361,Lisa Bushman,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,20 Oct,More details please. How did they enter garage? People door or garage door was it automatic or locked???
3684,165071361,John Alvarez,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,21 Oct,"It has a remote and a door that's inside the gate... I had a little lock on the inside of the gate, similar to a luggage lock. The outside of my garage appears to have been pried from the outside, the suggestion from the officer was to use slide brackets on the inside so it couldn't be opened even with the remote."
3685,165071361,dick/barbara hopper,‚Ä¢ Country Club,20 Oct,"Thru the garage door, I bet.  If your man (people) door is secure and thieves can't get in thru a window or something (those bastards) can go thru the garage door from alley side.  Mine is just dropped  up and down by using the door opener (on my key fob) or the little pad that some have on the outside of the garage door.  You can punch in your code to have the garage door activated using that  pad.  So I think of the garage door as being ""locked"" when the garage door is down.  It sounds a lot more complicated than it really is... "
3686,165071361,Meredith Gabow,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,20 Oct,There is a Facebook group. ‚ÄúStolen bikes denver‚Äù or something like that.  It might help.  Hoping I might get my Bike back as well.

3688,165071361,Anna Jones,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,20 Oct,This is a coordinated effort. Check encampments! They‚Äôre open air bike chop shops. We recovered ours that way but it was unpleasant and confrontational. Police can‚Äôt help.
3689,165071361,Tina Davis,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,20 Oct,"this is probably the fourth or fifth post I have seen on ND about garages being broken into within the last 5 days.  It is very concerning.  we had one bike stolen from our garage several years ago so we keep ours locked to a metal rack inside the garage, but if someone is really determined, they could break that also."
3690,165071361,Joyce Brown,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,20 Oct,We have a feature that allows us to lock our doors to any remote device and have removed the emergency openers.
3691,165071361,Carrie Bergman,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,20 Oct,We also had a bike stolen on Saturday. My husband ended up finding it on Monday over by East High School.
3692,165071361,Mary Kitchen,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,20 Oct,We may need to add garage doors to our alarm systems. This amount of crime is very discouraging for our neighborhood.  I think this is not random but a very organized group of criminals.
3693,165071361,Cole Haynes,‚Ä¢ Country Club,21 Oct,"A garage door alarm is about as cheap as they come. For not much more. A device that tells you when, how, how long, and it‚Äôs current state. And if open. Shut it. Automatic or manual."
3694,165071361,Robert Gonzales,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,20 Oct,"Hi. We actually live right across the street. The other night I could have sworn that I heard some noise in our alley. My partner and I both went outside to investigate and we did not see anything but now with your experience and what I heard we might be talking about the same night and incident. Please provide some more details on the actual day that you think that this happened.  I will ask our neighbor who has cameras facing Detroit, to see if any came up on her views of the street."
3695,165071361,John Alvarez,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,21 Oct,"So I hadn't been in the garage since Saturday morning to get some stuff for yard work. I didn't notice anything wrong, it's just odd that it was the only thing gone... There were snowboards tools and some other fairly valuable items in it at the time and as far as I can tell the bike was the only thing missing."
3696,165071361,Cole Haynes,‚Ä¢ Country Club,21 Oct,Zip tie the emergency opener shut. Double zip tie. So sorry hope it turns up. What time (sorry if you mentioned)! They‚Äôd probably have had to ride by me
3697,165071361,Cole Haynes,‚Ä¢ Country Club,21 Oct,Tend to find (when I was a victim) all my stuff on OfferUp because of the anonymity
3698,165071361,John Alvarez,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,21 Oct,I've been keeping a watchful eye... The bearings weren't in the front tire hub so if they tried to ride away they were in for a rude awakening üòè

3706,156274774,Peter F.,‚Ä¢ Eastmoor Park,2 Aug,People I am a huge conservative! We need to consider all people during this time of crisis. Homeless People need a safe haven were they can stay distanced and reasonable safe. We need to address the Homeless crisis but this is not the time to get confrontational about the encampment.
3707,156274774,Reeves B.,‚Ä¢ Harvey Park,28 Aug,I never participate in online chats about public policy because my observation has been that such chats are usually driven by emotions and competing political ideologies with very limited awareness of the facts ...but I just CAN'T resist weighing in on this homeless discussion.

3716,154677621,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Jul,It would be great to turn it into low-income housing.
3717,154677621,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Jul,The cost would be prohibitive. It would also depreciate all the properties in the area. Personally I think it would be a poor idea.

3719,154677621,Mark Stenstrom,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Jul,The main Treat Hall is a national registered landmark so it won't be taken down thankfully.
3720,154677621,David Akerson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Jul,"Anna Mccaffrey, i had the similar thought.  The worlds greatest homeless facility"
3721,154677621,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Jul,As long as you live far enough away it does not depreciate your homes value.
3722,154677621,Ben Miller,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jul,Richard Boehm yup
3723,154677621,David Akerson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Jul,"Richard Boehm, I live 1/2 block away.  Johnson and Wales would have indoor apartments for every person, no tents or outdoor sleeping.  There are cafeterias, classrooms, shower and bathrooms, theatres.  Great for the city of Denver, a fantastic solution for our homeless issue"
3724,154677621,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Jul,What I find interesting is your profile says you live on Glencoe a mile away and not a half block
3725,154677621,David Akerson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Jul,An old profile that I haven't updated.  I live on Olive St. now in the 1700 block.
3726,154677621,Donna Burrell,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Jul,Are there any thoughts about the property being declared a historical landmark? I have lived a block away for 40+ tears and there's so much history to protect.
3727,154677621,David Akerson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Jul,See above Donna.  Apparently Treat Hall already is.  As for the rest of the campus....?
3728,154677621,Gami Mattson,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,16 Jul,"Donna, I totally agree with you. I grew up 60+ years with it being Colorado Women‚Äôs College. It has a wonderful history."
3729,154677621,Keegan Perkins,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jul,Affordable housing in those dorms would be helpful. I think it‚Äôs too early to know what will happen.
3730,154677621,Kat Aguilar,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Jul,Maybe a community center for actual parkhill ?
3731,154677621,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jul,As I was driving down Colorado Blvd I noticed that there are a couple of abandoned hotel. Also some of the hotels on Colfax. Should be cheap to remodel and use for homeless shelters
3732,154677621,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,42w,"Sadly Richard those hotels are being sold to developers who are planning to build 12-story market-value apt buildings with no parking, which will be a new ring of hell to deal with. The neighbors are fighting it.  You are right about them being perfect for low-income housing though. There is no real long term plan to abate the homeless problem in the city.(edited)"
3733,161498876,Patty Purves,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Sep,Katie - is there any way he can get to a TJMaxx?  I'd be willing to buy him a giftcard to help him find at least some of what he needs.
3734,161498876,Katie Lindenberg,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,15 Sep,That is SO nice - thank you! I could either take him or get some items for him there.

3736,161498876,Jan Holland-Beachley,‚Ä¢ Lowry,15 Sep,Or Kohl's for big and tall men is another good choice.

3738,161498876,Jan Holland-Beachley,‚Ä¢ Lowry,15 Sep,What kind of toiletries?
3739,161498876,Mary Ellen Peterson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,16 Sep,I volunteer at Assistance League- they have a great selection of men‚Äôs clothing really inexpensive- I would be happy to pay for them ~ the store is 1 block west of Monaco on E Evens next to McDonalds . Please private message me if that would work

3741,160442469,Nick Kirchhof,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Sep,To my knowledge Sawyer is one of the few city councilors that has actually pushed back on some zoning changes. Cdebaca is generally also someone to push back against developers If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre interested in you should look at the council voting records on many other rezonings.
3742,160442469,Anne Delphia,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,6 Sep,"Normal citizens do that now but once this zoning change happens ‚Äòpermit by use‚Äô will be allowed and none of the old zoning laws that we know now will apply.  In fact, the are over 40 applications currently in the group living section waiting to add ADU‚Äôs to properties in our neighborhoods.   One is on 1055 Locust street they plan on adding a eight bedroom structure in front of the current 900 sq ft home.  To house whom?! Felons, homeless, sober living? If this plan is approved this zoning change will be allowed sometime this October."
3743,160442469,Susan Young,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Sep,"The Group Living Proposal is rezoning for ALL of Denver, except for HOAs and those in a Zone 59.  This passed city council 8-0 and if it passes in October, there will be NO limit on the number of people in an apartment or a home. The number of autos will increase per home. Halfway houses for prisoners, rehab, etc. will be allowed in residential neighborhoods with NO buffer zone between them and schools. This is to promote equity, EXCEPT for those in an HOA or Zone 59 (Central Park is one of those).  I think all of this information is correct, if not, please let me know.

3744,160442469,Wende Reoch,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,5 Sep,"It has NOT been to City Council for a vote yet.  Most likely you meant the vote at the Planning Board.  Plus your other statements are alarmist imo (heavens! The parking!) but other than that, all good."
3745,160442469,John Derungs,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,5 Sep,I think it only passed at the Planning Board this week which takes into consideration city policy and does not weigh in on the views of citizens - City Council hearings to come are a different matter.
3746,160442469,John Derungs,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,5 Sep,Also thanks for sending this brochure - must have missed it!
3747,160442469,John Derungs,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,5 Sep,Seems like an annual survey like I just took might be one way to measure public sentiment especially over time.
3748,160442469,Anne Delphia,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,6 Sep,It‚Äôs about time.  Most City Council members haven‚Äôt told ANY of their constituents about this.   It‚Äôs purposely been hidden from citizens across Denver.

3760,160442469,Gretchen Koehler,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,6 Sep,"What is a ""NIMBY""?"
3761,160442469,Jim Burness,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,6 Sep,"Judy, I believe your criticism is misguided. You may recall Councilwoman Sawyer's predecessor was ready to rubber-stamp a Walmart at 9th and Colorado before the neighborhood rebelled, as well as a very dense development at Alameda and Hudson that would have made parking a nightmare on the surrounding blocks. "
3762,160442469,Katie McCrimmon,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,6 Sep,"Hi Judy. Amanda has been amazing. She successfully helped us fight developers.  I don't know what information you have, but it may not be accurate. Before you criticize Amanda, check in with her. She's incredibly responsive."

3766,160442469,Scott Sanderson,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,6 Sep,I am a resident and I am asking for rezoning to legalize multifamily.
3767,160442469,Stephen Eppler,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,7 Sep,That is not what the Group Living Amendment is about.
3768,160442469,Nancy Relihan,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Sep,Stephen Eppler multi family in the development world means high rise apartment buildings.  Definition of high rise can be interpreted different ways.  I see it as 5 stories and above.
3769,160442469,Dee Went,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,6 Sep,"Denver is putting the cart before the horse. Need to correct residential build rules need to stop allowing builds up to property lines, gutter and runoffs to downgradient property, removing too much permeable cover, low grade lead waterlines, no outdoor space for increased population, poor police protection for small crime like theft and loitering, requiring homeowners to pay for sidewalk upgrades etc. instead of making these corrections to ensure property owners that their land is secured we are being pushed to make another opened ended overreaching rule. Thoughtful change is not fast but can be more successful for all involved. "
3770,160442469,Darlene Robertson,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,7 Sep,"Ahhhhh... do you understand we NEED rezoning? Sometimes it‚Äôs to PREVENT new tall buildings, no industrial ones AND the important inclusion of Tiny Home development. We can‚Äôt be all NIMBY and expect downtown to handle all the homelessness. POWER TO THE PEOPLE for fair housing. So... tell Amanda directly what you want. If you‚Äôre being selfish... just be selfish. Don‚Äôt pass the buck."
3771,160442469,Anne Delphia,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,35w,If this rezoning was about preventing tall buildings in our neighborhoods I'd be all in.  This zoning amendment isn't about that at all.  Why do you think developers and realtors are backing this?  They can't wait to get their projects in our neighborhoods.  Ive read the entire GL zoning amendment and there is nothing in there about preventing tall buildings.(edited)
3772,160442469,Peter Meinig,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Sep,"I think all public officials in Colorado should be required to live in section 8 housing while taking a paycheck funded by the taxpayer, and that goes for Polis, Gardner, Hickenpooper - the whole lot of them.  They are, by definition, supposed to work for us, not 'the city', definitely not the developers and interest groups, but the citizens.  The people! My block will be affected by rezoning if it is allowed to happen.  If it gets rammed down our throats, it's me, not some politician living in a castle in Hilltop, but ME that it will affect.  So I take offense when some fella calls me the N word (NIMBY), when they themselves just recently moved literally into the back yard of a historic Park Hill mansion and built a $2.2M house there that looks inconsistent with everything else around it.  I find it absurd when some 'woke' person tells me that I am not empathetic because I don't want to allow a high density high-rise five doors down to be thrown up by a developer, especially when I bought something that I have poured my heart into improving for the last 11 years.  I knew exactly what I was buying, and now, without my consent, people that don't live on my block, politicians getting rich under the table, and newly arrived transplants jaded by the high cost of living - all get together and want to fundamentally change the face of my block.  You first."
3773,160442469,Carol Emrick,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Sep,"This is what we are dealing with in the East Denver Plan. 500 neighbors at a meeting at Johnson and Wales and the city council members still don't listen!!! I hate these developers. It's all about the money. Park Hill was nationally known for their churches and members who stopped the ""white flight to the suburbs"" back in the 50's. We are truly a ""neighborhood"" where you actually know your neighbors and care and relate to them. I have lived here most of my life and I want to continue living here, but I feel like ""we are losing the war""."

3785,174372162,Alise Kermisch,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,20 Jan,"After just going through this type of experience and having the final court sentencing about 3 weeks ago, I strongly encourage you to request an officer come to you and take a written report. Make sure you get a case number - with out a written report the incident doesn't exist. Even if you don't think you can identify the person fully there is a very strong likely hood that this person is victimizing others and the cases can be connected if there is a written report. Think about anything you saw - type of phone used to record, items you might have seen in the car, type or brands of clothes, marks on the vehicle, any small detail could be what links the person to the case or the cases together."
3786,174372162,Holly Booker,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,20 Jan,This is a great point. I will do that. Thank you and I'm sorry you had to go through that!

3794,174372162,Alise Kermisch,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,20 Jan,"Unfortunately Sandra, research has proven out that acts like this are a form of mental illness and trying to ""make fun of"" or ""shame"" the individual does not effectively change their behavior. Mental illness doesn't stop without intervention and treatment and indecent exposures are shown to be gateway activities to much more serious and often violent sexual crimes if no intervention is made."

I never looked at it being their fault. It is not their fault they are homeless. It is not their fault that they can‚Äôt get into a shelter because it‚Äôs safer on the streets than in a shelter. I met some very nice homeless individuals and ALL of them were trying to look for a job, but their interviews were far south in Englewood or Lakewood. They had no way to get to work even if they got the job. So please, stop complaining so much and be grateful that you are not homeless during a time like this."

They could be relocated to these site and with free camping this would allow banning camping on sidewalks, parks, easements and along  roadways. This would allow social efforts to be concentrated to those areas and policed. I empathize but creating unsanitary, unstructured, health issues and potentially criminal sites is not an answer."

3840,158387521,Michael Schulman,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,17 Aug,Here is an easy way to help support the code change. 
3841,158387521,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,17 Aug,Michael Schulman No thanks. I do not want to live next to a flop house with 30 people in 1600 ft. This plan has almost no planning and no regulation once the flop houses are occupied.
3842,158387521,Michael Schulman,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,17 Aug,It appears most of the statements on here are fearmongering and do not contain actual facts.

Andrew Webb even admitted on a call last week that there would be no increase of enforcement for this overreaching overgrowth. Code enforcement can't keep up now. And yes, 30 people could live in 1600 sq ft because children are not regulated. 10 adults with 2 children each =30"
3844,158387521,meira hertzberg,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,18 Aug,Not fear mongering. Presently TWO unrelated persons interpreted to includes the entire family of both. Could be 10 or more ppl in one house.  Not sure how 10 unrelated will be interpreted.

3847,158387521,meira hertzberg,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,18 Aug,This proposal is to increase the number of unrelated persons up to 10 living together in ALL residential situations not just group homes.
3848,158387521,meira hertzberg,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,18 Aug,It is not just group living. ALL RESIDENTIAL situations will be allowed to have 10 unrelated persons (and possibly their families) living under one roof.
3849,158387521,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,18 Aug,Which could result in 30 people and probably 8 cars.
3850,158387521,Simon Krauss,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,18 Aug,"There are a number of valid concerns raised here wrt the current proposal on group housing. However, I am not particularly thrilled with the apparent alternative -- letting developers build apartment buildings in existing primarily single residence neighborhoods. I don't think many developers have the integrity of the neighborhood in mind when they build. Much of the new construction I've seen is nothing I want to live near. In fairness to developers, I'm not sure how one builds affordable housing that works with our neighborhoods. I don't think it is good to not address affordable housing as our neighborhoods are already getting too expensive for many to live in which does not help in maintaining a city or serving its inhabitants. Probably not a perfect solution here but in my mind at least group housing brings less irreversible harm to a neighborhood than newly constructed apartments."
3851,158387521,meira hertzberg,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,18 Aug,"I respectfully disagree Simon bc the apartment house building form is not allowed in every zone district. The ‚Äúgroup home‚Äù amendment allows someone to take, for ex., a single unit and allows up to 10 unrelated (plus their spouses, children, and possibly other relatives) to live in whatever building form is there already or allowed to be built in ALL residential forms and zone districts."
3852,158387521,Simon Krauss,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,18 Aug,Good point Meira. I hadn't thought about the zoning. I suppose then with current zoning (assuming no changes) the end result of adding density will be areas with apartments and areas with houses which may be fine but seems like it will mean living in a neighborhood with single family housing may be reserved for the wealthy which I don't think is a good societal outcome.
3853,158387521,Sonya Anderson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,18 Aug,Don‚Äôt they also represent all of those other people that you don‚Äôt want anywhere near you?
3854,158387521,meira hertzberg,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,18 Aug,"Sonya, with all do respect, it is not clear that ppl don‚Äôt want certain ‚Äúothers‚Äù living near them.  If you take a 2000sf house and have 20 ppl living in it, at least 10 of which might be licensed drivers, where will the cars be parked? What about noise? What about sanitation? That is a lot more garbage being generated-and my understanding is there is no commensurate increase in the required number of bathrooms.  "
3855,158387521,Sonya Anderson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,18 Aug,"Those that are likely less fortunate than you since you live in Congress Park and Montclair, etc. Why don‚Äôt we find some crappy desert that‚Äôs almost unlivable and tell them they can live there. Oh no, we already did that to some other people."
3856,158387521,meira hertzberg,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,18 Aug,"Sonya, I hear what you are saying . I just don‚Äôt see this as helping"
3857,158387521,meira hertzberg,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,18 Aug,"And, btw, Sonya, we are a mixed race family who do not own a home. I am not sure who you are directing your comments at."

3864,161785478,Pam Becker,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,19 Sep,"I wonder how many would go if they actually set these up?  Many of the homeless deal with mental illness and one of their big fears is people controlling them.  I just wonder ‚Äúif they build them they will come?‚Äù My husband works with the mentally ill and used to help get them off the street and into housing.  Many times he would go and check on them and their apartments were empty and they were living on the streets not in it.  Their fears kept them from living in a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù place.  I‚Äôm sure some would, but without the mental health being worked on, it may be hard for others.  I don‚Äôt have the answers, I wish I did.  Just wondering out loud."

3866,159225665,Kelly Austin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Aug,Don‚Äôt understand your question
3867,159225665,Suzy Herndon,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,26 Aug,"If this is yet another homeless camp with an abundance of theft and drug activity, then YES, I am troubled by this ‚Äúgathering spot‚Äù. The city is not addressing the problems of mental illnesses and drug abuse. Taking down homeless camps and allowing new ones to pop up is not acceptable and does not solve the underlying problems. I understand that I am opening up myself for a lot of criticism, but enabling and accepting the current situation is not safe, nor is it acceptable in my opinion. I have had encounters on my bike that threatened my safety. If people don‚Äôt realize how much we have enabled drug abuse, then I urge you to take the time to really see what is happening around you. The homeless problem is by and large NOT people living paycheck to paycheck and have encountered hardship. As a strong community, we come together to help these individuals and families, and they are usually open to accepting this help. A very large population of the tent communities are able-bodied people strung out on drugs. Look and really see. I am willing to commit to being a part of the solution if we can actually address the underlying problems vs enabling drug abuse with money, tents, etc."
3868,159225665,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Aug,No one should be living on the streets. The city needs to restructure its entire budget and force developers to partner with them in building low-income housing. 80 % of the homeless want permanent housing.  Let's ban together to get the city to do their job.

3883,164852915,Molly Rudo,‚Ä¢ Lowry,17 Oct,"Sending prayers. This is horrible. Have they launched an investigation, do you have a detective on the case, and has John been brought in and held on suspicion, since so many people witnessed him with her?"

3885,164852915,Kirsten Wakefield,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,17 Oct,Kat‚Äôs mom has been taking care of her 2 little girls; and insisted on her taking her medication and seeing her psychiatrist if she wanted to come home... for her daughters sakes. They‚Äôve seen their mom‚Äôs struggles while unmediated; and have been having a hard time. But that‚Äôs nothing compared to what they are going thru now.
3886,164852915,Kirsten Wakefield,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,17 Oct,"Knowing Kat, she was probably just wearing jeans and a hoodie"
3887,164852915,Kirsten Wakefield,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,17 Oct,I‚Äôm not sure what the police are doing. They did interview John; but nothing further has happened since he denied even knowing her.

3891,164852915,Jan Holland-Beachley,‚Ä¢ Lowry,17 Oct,Kirsten- I hope Kats mom is doing okay. It is always so difficult for a family when their family member has a serious mental illness and refuses to take their medications. I don‚Äôt know if your family has ever tried to obtain court-ordered medication for her but I know that the bar is very high to take away the persons right to refuse medication. It‚Äôs a terrible position for all to be in. I am so sorry that she has this additional vulnerability in such an already difficult situation. Is the inpatient psychiatric team involved in helping law enforcement think through what kinds of behaviors or symptoms Kat would be expected to exhibit if she was traumatized and un medicated. Is there an extensive search going on for her now in that area?
3892,164852915,Kirsten Wakefield,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,17 Oct,"I have no idea why Hargrove isn‚Äôt in jail; possibly he served his term, or was part of the recent program releasing violent offenders, idk. "

3906,157962004,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,38w,"Wrong. Out of state commercial landlords will pack tenants in like sardines  without regard to neighbors or the health and safety of their tenants. They'll buy multiple properties, charge increased room or bed by bed rent and become slumlords in every neighborhood. This won't raise the quality of life for a few but instead bring the quality of life down for all. Have you been to NY, SF, LA recently? Do you want that at your front door?(edited)"
3907,157962004,Evelinda Urman,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,"From this feed, I think some of you may be new residents.  Welcome.  Some history: We citizens have approved MILLIONS for homeless during then Mayor Hickenlooper and now Mayor Hancock. Where is the money?  A few years ago the City Auditor said they did not know.  Also, our government greatly reduced funding to what I will call 1/2 way housing.  This proposal of so many unrelated adults (and unlimited children) is their way of putting a band aid on the problem they created.  No where have they planned for housing at entry level pricing or affordable re-hab.  Now they just want to make it for profit flop-houses in neighborhoods.  I agree with Nancy Bell about Community Corrections and Homeless Shelters, remove this from the number of people that may live in one dwelling.  Lisa Ramos, I believe your heart is in the right place when you say we need diverse and all kinds of people.  No one is arguing this.  But as I speak to my friends in CAP Hill, they are not happy with the recent rise in crime and shooting.  All kinds of people are good, but safety is needed for all of these kinds of people.  Finally, if you have children in your home, you will appreciate the child abuse and pedophile laws that are in place."
3908,157962004,Lisa Ramos,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Aug,"I agree that the City and State have done far too little to address homelessness and affordable housing in our communities. It's shameful and I work to hold all elected officials responsible. But - contrary to your assumptions - I have lived in Denver for 25 years and Cherry Creek North for 16 years, and I am a mother. None of those details change my mind about what is right - housing options are right, affordable housing is right, diverse communities are right, this elitist not-in-my-backyard BS is sad, shameful, and very wrong. I speak to my friends and neighbors who are hanging on in this city by a thread- homeowners and renters alike have trouble living in this city and we can change that with sensible group housing rules like those proposed after two years of study and community input."

3922,164973781,JB Lewis,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,19 Oct,"The ""porch camper"" post reminded me of my father's family who grew up in a small town in Western Pennsylvania. Homelessness was also an issue back then and included so-called ""hobos"" who  rode the rails. Apparently, there was a fencepost on their property that was marked with a symbol designating their house as a place where a hobo could get something to eat in exchange for doing some work around the property. Things weren't as scary back then, and I'm told his mother was welcoming to these who came to the door looking for something to eat IF they were willing to do a little work... (Yes--I realize the world is a much different and dangerous place nowadays, and I'm not suggesting that people should offer food in exchange for work when it comes to homeless strangers.)"

I believe that I recently read Amanda Sawyer is now a ""nay"" vote, but she is just one voice. This decision should not be one made by City Council. Where do we go with this?"
3945,155671513,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,41w,"We need to contact our councilperson, we need to contact our homeowners association, we need to contact all neighborhood and citywide media. Most important is the homeowners association‚Äôs opposition in every district. Their main impetus is to disperse community corrections and homeless shelters throughout all Denver neighborhoods. They have let the leases on their community correction facilities expire and want to shift this expense to the neighborhoods. Please make those three phone calls.(edited)"
3946,155671513,Anne Delphia,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,25 Jul,Joyce Amanda did not say she was a ‚ÄòNay‚Äô.  She said ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt happening in ‚Äòher‚Äô neighborhood and she would vote for a revised version of this law.  What does a ‚Äòrevised‚Äô version mean? Oh and it‚Äôs okay üëå not to be in her neighborhood but ours when we are across the street? This shouldn‚Äôt be in anyone‚Äôs neighborhood.  All she did was ramble‚Äòpolitical speak‚Äô making you believe she was on your side but clearly she isn‚Äôt being completely honest about her vote.
3947,155671513,Allen Shaw,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,23 Jul,"This is an extremely serious situation.  None of the council members would welcome a sexual predator, violent criminal, murderer, or domestic abuser into an extra 200 feet of their homes but they are willing to put 15 of those people into a 3000 square foot home next to any of us.  Undoubtedly the council members vote their mind and not the feelings of their constituents.  Elections do matter.  Certainly recall is an option. Visit Civic Center Park and see what is happening to our city and no one is doing anything about it.  Garbage, trash, drugs, people urinating in public, and our leadership is silent, Hancock and the council.  Are Cranmer and Robinson the next parks to be ruined?"

3951,155671513,Joyce Haberkorn,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,24 Jul,"Denver has never made any attempt to enforce the > 2 unrelated people in a home provision. What would make us think they'd stay right on top of the new convoluted proposal if it were enacted. We know better. This provision exempts communities whose HOAs have limitations in place (think high end properties, gated communities, etc). It will not be a problem for them, so there is no interest or concern there. It is the middle class ""affordable homes"" that will be the target. Landlords and real estate companies have an opportunity to pack these homes and bring in great rent without any responsibility to exterior upkeep, lawn maintenance, etc. There is no provision to make a landlord or property owner help preserve a neighborhood. We are already seeing the result of rental unkempt properties in our neighborhoods. The present situation will only exacerbate. What's not to like about this great idea put forth in an unfair process?"
3952,155671513,Debra Taylor,‚Ä¢ Cherry - Leetsdale,25 Jul,With Congressman Ken Buck!!  This is just reactionary crap!!

I care about my neighborhood and my home.   I‚Äôm pretty sure your Mr Ken is not on my home paperwork.  If he was I would certainly have him help with the upkeep, taxes and mortgage.  But unfortunately it‚Äôs just me and I care about my neighborhood and what happens here and pay for it too."
3954,155671513,Debbie Young,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Jul,"Denver is the only major city in Colorado and most of the rest of the US that has held onto the 2 unrelated people zoning.  Denver is getting more and more unaffordable and it is the hard-working people, like firemen, police, teachers, nurses, hairdressers and more than cannot afford to live in or near areas that they work.  People who have lived in neighborhoods all their lives are being displaced.  This is an affordability proposal and I support it."
3955,155671513,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,25 Jul,As well as primarily being about Community Corrections and Homeless Shelters/Halfway Houses issue. And on the co-op side = 10 unrelated adults plus unlimited relatives to each.
3956,155671513,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,25 Jul,"Another concern with this proposal is allowing all of the changes as ""use by right"". This means, as a use, they are automatically allowed. Instead of issuing permits as needed, use by right has very little accountability. A permit can be revoked if the holder abuses the Code; use by right has no recourse."

3969,176209324,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,7 Feb,Some? How about the vast majority of neighborhoods think this specific plan is very flawed and needs to be readdressed with some equity and no special interests on the design team.
3970,176209324,Dana Smart,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,7 Feb,"More than 80% of every Denver neighborhood strongly opposed this insane bill in the Fall, forcing city council to withdraw passing it.

3983,176209324,Cheryl Shoup,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,7 Feb,We are very opposed to this also. The parking on our street is bad enough now.  We have 4 houses just on our end of the block that have numerous people living in one house and they have between 5 & 10 cars at each house.
3984,176209324,Julio T.,‚Ä¢ Alamo Placita,9 Feb,"Yes and now they are legally allowed to live there, so why don't you mind your own business? Because guess what, you don't own the parking in front of your house."
3985,176209324,Christine Hoff,‚Ä¢ City Park West,9 Feb,one small reason i don't own a car. i'm in deeply dense city park west and several of my neighbors are car-less. it can be done. i realize it doesn't work for everyone.
3986,176209324,Ryk M.,‚Ä¢ Hampden,7 Feb,When I see comments on this subject I'm reminded of a quote by the famous Dr. Peter Venkman: ‚ÄúHuman sacrifice! Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!‚Äù
3987,176209324,Ryk M.,‚Ä¢ Hampden,7 Feb,"Paige Burkeholder - Wow! Not a single accusation that you just levied at me is true, and I challenge you to show otherwise or retract what you said. If the amendment passes, the only thing I'll be doing is NOT worrying about my property's value, my safety, or my neighborhood's character. You know as well as I do that just because someone supports the amendment, it doesn't mean that they need to do anything personally to help the people who will be helped by it -- no more than you would need to do something personally if you were advocating for, say, extra funding for policing. It's a policy change, not a crusade."
3988,176209324,Ryk M.,‚Ä¢ Hampden,9 Feb,"As you can see, she removed her comment, part of which accused me of calling her a white, privileged woman. My conversations with her were were always civil, and I think that I just got under her skin by continually correcting her misinformation."
3989,176209324,Paige Burkeholder,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park East,13w,Here is more information that the City hasn‚Äôt shared:  https://us17.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=5d2c19537162f3f275a0316fa&id=c599bec59d
3990,176209324,Kathleen M.,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,7 Feb,"No one has mentioned another main concerns, halfway houses for drug/criminal/other facilities to be set up throughout the city.  Now they are concentrated near downtown or by correctional facilities.  City Council wants more options where to put them, regardless of bus routes, job availability or easy access to meetings."
3991,176209324,Julio T.,‚Ä¢ Alamo Placita,9 Feb,This isn't true...halfway houses would only be allowed along commercial corridors.
3992,176209324,Jeannine S.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,8 Feb,It‚Äôs only fair the City should be allowed more options! Why should low income parts of town  always be the ones to get these type of places!?

3994,176209324,Courtney Copp,‚Ä¢ University Hills,9 Feb,It passed 11-2!

I know not all of these Group LIving rentals will be renting to felons some will be to the disabled, sober living, and elderly but many of them will halfway houses for felons. I also know the goal of these halfway houses are to rehabilitate.  But the recidivsim rate in Denver for rehabilitation is only 50%.  I am not comfortable living next to violent criminals (including those that have convicted of rape, child molestation, violent assaults, home invasion, car jacking and more) not when the rate of rehabilitation is so low.  No Im not an alarmist.  These charts, graphs and numbers are from City's Planning Board for the Group Living amendment proposal. Nancy is just the messenger.  Thank you Nancy for passing this information to us.  Kinda of scary."
4011,156513613,Margere Weiss,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,30 Jul,Very scary. I to have kept up with all the information.
4012,156513613,Maggie Odell,‚Ä¢ Hale,30 Jul,Glad to see actionable steps being taken to help the unhoused in our community. I hope the city is able to follow through and execute this with the support it will need.
4013,156513613,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,30 Jul,This will not be regulated if it passes. It is very poorly written and should be implemented by permit only.
4014,156513613,Anne Delphia,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,31 Jul,Anna McCaffery you are not kidding it‚Äôs a joke but not for the people it will impact.

4017,156513613,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,6 Aug,"Our city government in action.  Instead of finding a solution to the problem, let's just slowly destroy all Denver neighborhoods by introducing the problem to each of our doorsteps thus bringing down the standard of living for the rest of us. They allowed this to happen at Morey Middle School and it'll now spread into your neighborhood with this initiative.  Rather than let us vote on such a controversial issue, the city council will just shove it down our throats.  No wonder so many people are considering leaving urban areas in our state and elsewhere."
4018,156513613,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,6 Aug,What is further puzzling me is in essence they are encouraging landlords around the city to become slumlords by allowing them to pack as many bodies into a home without regard to the health and safety of those living there or the neighbors around them. If you've got a nightly rental on your street BEWARE! Why go to the trouble of renting it out each night when you can just cram 10-20 people in all the time and make just as much or more money? Nightly rentals are heavily regulated for the good of the neighborhood but these massive group homes won't be. This clearly isn't about helping those who can't find housing.  It's about attempting to sweep the problem under the rug and spreading the pain to the entirety of the city.

4025,158670092,Sandy Reddic,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,37w,"Bottom line is : Remax Alliance' choice to sever a business relationship with Ms. Reich that spanned AT LEAST 30 years.speaks to an egregious break in the agency's Agent Code of Conduct . I am certain, that after AT Least 30 years, Remax Alliance extended every consideration to Ms Reich while deliberating their decision.(edited)"
4026,158670092,Patricia Bainter,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,20 Aug,There‚Äôs not a lot of ‚Äòhigh‚Äô going on these days. I agreed with a lot of what was in Denice‚Äôs article about the homeless situation getting out of hand and Civic Center Park becoming an unsafe place. It‚Äôs too bad that the price of expressing outrage over an obvious problem is to get cancelled.
4027,158670092,Paula Ison,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,20 Aug,It‚Äôs too bad she thought she could go onto other people‚Äôs property and steal their signs. It‚Äôs too bad she equated the Black Lives Matter movement with the KKK. It‚Äôs too bad she tried to cancel other people‚Äôs 1st Amendment rights.
4028,158670092,Maggie Reyes Leczinski,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,20 Aug,It‚Äôs not ok to steal and trespass; am I crazy? She was fired because those are not attributes of a realtor.  If we want to talk about her opinion piece in the Glendale Chronicle  I feel it is open to criticism because it is an opinion. Perhaps it would help ‚Äúsaid person‚Äù if she recognized her behavior was wrong- until then I suspect she will continue to be the subject of ridicule. Again I repeat... stealing and trespassing= bad!!
4029,158670092,Paula Sommer,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,37w,unfortunately  racism is endemic to the human condition just as stupidity is.    I know Denice and she is not  a racist in any way shape or form.   If she saw a KKK sign she would have removed it as well...be it good bad or indiferent.   BLM has nothing to do with black people..BLM was hijacked and it is now highly offensive to some people...even some blacks.  She has a good heart and i hope this doesn't ruin her life.(edited)
4030,158670092,Jane Skarka,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,37w,"Paula, I‚Äôm not sure where you‚Äôre getting your information from. You are a white woman living in Hilltop and you propose that the BLM movement has been hijacked and you are equating it with the KKK? Please. First, people were saying they needed proof that D.R. did in fact commit a crime, now that she has admitted it, you are now trying to justify her reasons for doing so? That‚Äôs a really far stretch.

4035,156795564,Darlene Hurley,‚Ä¢ Happy Canyon,2 Aug,The problem with the state doing it is that they can't get their own computer programs to work. Look at how often everything is down in the state. You would never have any internet service if they were doing it.
4036,156795564,James L.,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill SW,2 Aug,"Yes, the law was rammed through by telecom lobbyists to make it harder for anyone to compete with them. Those communities that HAVE won locally (Longmont is one exqmple) have seen business growth and consumer satisfaction."

4038,156795564,Cindy Gioffredi,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,2 Aug,"Internet as a public utility would allow the powers that be to monitor ALL our private info, etc. Not for me."

4049,156795564,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,4 Aug,"Aimee Rullo i know there are a few small ISPs left; the ones that survived have found niches, such as Forethought that has its own cable in parts of downtown, and focuses primarily on full service business accounts"

4074,167939063,Carol Hunter,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Nov,They‚Äôve been erratic for months. Let Kroger corporate know. We feel safe at Trader Joe‚Äôs and Sprouts especially the new one in Central Park.  I compliment them every time I go.
4075,167939063,Julie Reusser,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Nov,Totally agree with Trader Joe‚Äôs- they are wonderful!
4076,167939063,Lulu Dorner,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,16 Nov,"Yeah! Trader Joe‚Äôs is the best! Clean, safe and the associates always very helpful and respectful! üëçüèº"
4077,167939063,Sherry Stevenson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Nov,We haven‚Äôt shopped King Sooper for months now.  They were slack at the time when it began.   We love Trader Joe‚Äôs/Sprouts we always feel safe there and the Safeway in Lowry. We only shop there the products we cannot purchase at TJ/Sprouts.
4078,167939063,Joanne Spillman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Nov,"Isn't Safeway more expensive? I could be wrong, though. I admit the Safeway in Mayfair is cleaner and more spread out than KS, though."
4079,167939063,Andrew Sweet,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Nov,Ditto to all the above.  I go to KS at 6-7 am on weekday.  Only way it makes any sense.  Safeway seems much better. Just need to break thirty years habit!!
4080,167939063,Tim Townsend,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,15 Nov,Sounds like a great question for King Soopers management.
4081,167939063,Joanne Spillman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Nov,"They don't care. I know plenty of people have complained, but nothing ever changes."
4082,167939063,Josh Joshua,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,15 Nov,"In this election year, we can vote with our feet. I like Safeway on Quebec and 1st. Immaculate and well organized."
4083,167939063,Sandra Stangle,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Nov,I would also recommend NOT doing curbside pickup at the Mayfair King Sooper.  The last time I did curbside they gave me less than half of my order but charged me for everything.  It took three weeks to get my money refunded.  This included going through their corporate office.  Since that time I have done curbside pickup at the south Monaco location with no problems.  I am thinking of switching to Safeway or Walmart for my curbside orders.
4084,167939063,Carol Fields,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,16 Nov,"I have had no problem at all with pickup at King Sooper Mayfair.   When they substitute, they charge the lower price."
4085,167939063,Nicole M.,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,15 Nov,I was there today and notice the same thing its irritating
4086,167939063,Jon Honegger,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Nov,I once watched a guy blast a farmers blow out onto the floor in the entrance. No one even flinched.....
4087,167939063,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,15 Nov,I üíØ believe that‚Äôs true
4088,167939063,Kevin Finnerty,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Nov,Social distancing seems to have ended the day that masks started.
4089,167939063,Robin Howe,‚Ä¢ Hale,15 Nov,That store has been a train wreck since Jack left
4090,167939063,Margaux M.,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,15 Nov,We should report them to the Department of Health they will be closed down.
4091,167939063,Kevin Finnerty,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Nov,Health department doesn't care. There's a store in town with 12 confirmed cases & they list it as 2 & do absolutely nothing.
4092,167939063,Margaux M.,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,16 Nov,Really? I know Tri-County Health certainly does. If you report it they go directly to the store
4093,167939063,Stephanie Bean,‚Ä¢ City Park,15 Nov,"I ordered from them for pick up occasionally as previous order fulfillments have been lacking.  I do the Target drive up in Glendale, it quick and easy.  If they don‚Äôt have what I ordered, I know ahead of time and can figure it out. I‚Äôm doing my best to stay away from people as we have a kid and a baby and can‚Äôt get sick and parent at the same time!"
4094,157703826,Laurie Moe,‚Ä¢ City Park,11 Aug,This is about the stupidest thing the city has ever come up with. Sure solve what you think is the answer JUST SHOVE ALL THE CRIMINALS & HOMELESS INTO ALL LIVING SPACES LIKE SARDINES THIS WAY YOU THINK YOU SOLVED THE PROBLEM.

4107,159083848,Kathryn Studer,‚Ä¢ Lowry,23 Aug,So sorry this happened to your friend. Crazy times.
4108,159083848,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,23 Aug,"I‚Äôm very sorry this happened to your friend!  Glad he was smart and did not get seriously hurt.  What kind of car and bike?  Cars sometime show up, mine did.  We can all keep a lookout.  300 pounds is hard to hide. Description?"
4109,159083848,Rachel Griffin,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,37w,"This is my worst fear, only instead of them taking an $$$$ bike, it‚Äôs taking my kids in their car seats. I am going to be triple observant from now on. I‚Äôm so sorry.(edited)"
4110,159083848,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Aug,I was at Famous Dave‚Äôs once and there was an unattended child in a car seat with the engine running. Called the police but not sure if anything was done. Is there some kind of child rearing courses the parents need to take???
4111,159083848,Marie McManus,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,23 Aug,"We are so glad his dog wasn‚Äôt in the car!! I would absolutely freak out if my car was taken w/ my dog inside ‚Äî to say nothing of children!! Worst fear, indeed. "
4112,159083848,Rachel Griffin,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,24 Aug,"Wow, I just assumed it was in a rack and that‚Äôs what attracted the thief. Now it‚Äôs even double scary."
4113,159083848,Casey Bowie Roberts,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,24 Aug,What time of day did this happen?
4114,159083848,Desiree Flynn,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,24 Aug,Omg I can see that space from my front window this is so crazy!! What time was this??
4115,159083848,Casey Bowie Roberts,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,24 Aug,I was there around 10am!
4116,159083848,Michael Ray,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,24 Aug,"Wow, crazier and crazier"
4117,159083848,Cristin Cochran,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24 Aug,Years ago a clerk there told me that the store was a good place for criminals because there was easy access for a getaway on 6th or Josephine and that he was always leery of occupied cars lingering in the lot.
4118,159083848,Gwen Ross,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,24 Aug,Wow..... This is my neighborhood and I use that 7 11
4119,159083848,Marie McManus,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,24 Aug,Happened at 2 pm
4120,159083848,Tina Davis,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,24 Aug,Got the wrong emoji by accident.  The fact that it happened at 2:00 is really frightening.  How could you even protect yourself?
4121,159083848,Kammy Alford,‚Ä¢ City Park West,24 Aug,A couple of weeks ago a friend watched in horror as a large man beat up a smaller man until he was out cold and then continued to beat him.  This was at a 7-Eleven on Colfax.
4122,159083848,Carrie Stiles,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24 Aug,"Horrible to watch.  I have been thru this scenario.  Some ways to handle this that have worked in the past, otherwise, I would not be sharing this info.  Lock yourself in your car, if you have one, then call 911.  Have a clear drive off route for yourself as you start honking and flashing lights, day or night at the scene.  Sometimes, others will join you in their cars.  (This happened in our case) This may lead to the aggressor being distracted enough to stop hitting the victim and reassess his situation.  If the aggressor comes after you, obviously drive off.  These actions saved a man‚Äôs life."
4123,159083848,catherine wilson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,24 Aug,Thank you for the information and glad he was not shot.
4124,159083848,Kammy Alford,‚Ä¢ City Park West,24 Aug,Makes you wonder if some 7-Eleven stores need to hire security?
4125,159083848,Judah Gubbay,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,24 Aug,We have an obligation to standby behind our police force and those who claim to defund the police force have one aim in mind
4126,159083848,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Aug,Defunding the police is not about not supporting officers.  It‚Äôs about transferring some of the responsibilities to agencies that are better able to assist and letting the police do their jobs.  This topic has nothing to do with the car jacking.
4127,159083848,Peg McCormick,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,24 Aug,This is terrifying information. Thank you for posting- we too use that store. Will now be MUCH more aware of occupied cars in that lot- it happens a lot.
4128,159083848,Marie McManus,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,24 Aug,"FYI there were no other cars in the lot. He was on foot, came from around the corner on Josephine."
4129,159083848,John Smith,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,24 Aug,Thank you for sharing.   At least your friend will be physically ok.  Had to have been terrifying.
4130,159083848,monica Armijo,‚Ä¢ Lowry,24 Aug,Awful!  I'm sorry this happened to your friend.
4131,159083848,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,24 Aug,"Stop going to places where lowlife people frequent - 7-11, Walmart, Dollar Stores. I just read an article that Dollar Store has the highest rate of police calls for crimes inside and outside their stores. Crooks are everywhere now but staying away from places they hangout is a good idea."
4132,159083848,Lesa Shkolnik,‚Ä¢ Country Club,24 Aug,"My kid‚Äôs school is 2 blocks from this 7-11, we go there sometimes for a ‚Äútreat‚Äù after school (when there used to be school). Qualifying any establishment as a place ‚Äúlow life people frequent‚Äù is short sighted and limiting."
4133,165977340,Nina Kirk,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,28 Oct,Keep believing. Just recently a cat was missing for about 8 weeks but was reunited with his family after he turned up at City Floral. üôèüíô
4134,165977340,Angel Rodriguez,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,28 Oct,And the crazy thing is he was black abd white as well.
4135,165977340,Leven Moore,‚Ä¢ Hale,27w,Don‚Äôt apologize and keep posting him. üòø(edited)
4136,165977340,Nancy Simmons-Walker,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,28 Oct,I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôll keep looking for you & hoping too.

4138,165977340,Judy Hendricks,‚Ä¢ Lowry,28 Oct,"hi, could you tell me about where you live?  There was a cat body that was in our courtyard a week and half ago, I hate to think it might be your kitty."
4139,165977340,Angel Rodriguez,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,28 Oct,Ivy and colfax
4140,165977340,Karen Kaiser,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,28 Oct,"did you check all the rescues? We have been looking for a new kitty and I saw a lot of black and white kitties on the Maxfund site, I'm sure there are more. I guess they check chips, though. The city is supposed to check bodies of deceased pets they pick up for chips, but they probably don't. :o(  so sorry"
4141,165977340,Angel Rodriguez,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,28 Oct,I have and covid has made it so difficult to just go to the shelters. I check ddfl denver animal shelter  Aurora animal shelter and I tried max fund but I guess they don't post found pets? I have only seen rescues with way too many blank pictures üòî all the shelters keep telling me that they scan every animal that comes in.  He is chipped and info is updated. So idk where else to check.
4142,165977340,Karen Kaiser,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,28 Oct,Your cat has unusual markings even for a tuxedo cat! I know how much you must miss him.
4143,165977340,Jane Skarka,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,28 Oct,"Why are you assuming someone is ‚Äúholding him hostage?‚Äù Colfax is a very dangerous place for any  friendly animal. I have helped several people find their dogs that were stolen by homeless people on or near Colfax. There is a strange man that rides around the neighborhood with a small pet carrier tied to the back of his bike. Your cat could have been hit by a car or attacked by an animal. I‚Äôm sorry to be the one to address the elephant in the room, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs kind or productive to accuse people either. I hope you find Ace against all the odds stacked up against such a sweet kitty, but I hope you also think twice about letting your other cats roam free outside. It isn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs fault that your cat is missing. I‚Äôm sorry."
4144,165977340,Michelle Badura,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,28 Oct,Damn Jane you ain‚Äôt gotta be a b. Let them have some hope.
4145,165977340,Leven Moore,‚Ä¢ Hale,27w,Jane Skarka that‚Äôs not cool. What‚Äôs wrong with you?? He‚Äôs hoping. Show some empathy. Jesus.(edited)
4146,165977340,Jane Skarka,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,28 Oct,"I would never give up hope and that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. I expected this. I speak for those who can‚Äôt speak for themselves. Of all the things that could have or have not happened to this sweet animal, the poster chose to accuse. In my opinion, that is ‚Äúnot cool.‚Äù Accept some responsibility. Keep attacking me if it makes you feel better."
4147,165977340,Leven Moore,‚Ä¢ Hale,28 Oct,"Jane Skarka yeah, you‚Äôre the victim. üôÑ"

4149,165977340,Angel Rodriguez,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,27w,"I have noticed throughout this whole time you have been callous with your responses. I dont know if thats a character flaw or what. But either way I don't appreciate your tone. I take damn good care of my animals and I am NOT a bad parent by allowing them to roam their space.  My cat is very friendly and very clean as well as really cute. I would not be surprised if some one picked him up and took him home. Maybe the strange guy with the bike cart? Or maybe you have him and your trying to throw me off your scent by being so rudely disrespectful. I have every right to ""assume""  so I can live with him never returning. Quit acting so guilty ""Jane""(edited)"
4150,165977340,Lori Lampe,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,28 Oct,"The angle isn't the best,  but could this be Ace?"
4151,165977340,Angel Rodriguez,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,29 Oct,I cant see the picture that you linked but I have checked denver animal shelter everyday.   Ace is only  1 1/2 yrs old. And on the leaner side.
4152,165977340,Kelly Fraser,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,29 Oct,I hope you find him
4153,165977340,Dirk Turner,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,29 Oct,"Promise, keeping an eye out for Ace."
4154,165977340,Beth Tirrell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,29 Oct,Poor wee thing! Keeping an eye out.

We have put out a cat carrier with lots of blankets and food everyday. I haven‚Äôt gotten a good look at the face, as your cat does have unusual markings. I live around 4th and Monaco. Next time I see him/ her I‚Äôll try to take a pic or PM you"
4156,165977340,Lisa Gilford,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,29 Oct,"If I can wrangle Jane Skarka to hunt with me, I will go out this weekend. Also do you have any posters? If so, have you posted. As I said, the gals who had the little shop there had a few cats so perhaps one was left behind and Ace is with them?"
4157,165977340,Amy Hughes,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,30 Oct,"Just saw this post (pic hopefully attached); maybe it‚Äôs Ace? If so, it sounds like he‚Äôs been taken to the Dumb Friends League."
4158,165977340,Angel Rodriguez,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,30 Oct,Thank you Amy. but sadly thats not Ace.
4159,165977340,Sean Sanchez,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,1 Nov,My wife and I saw a kitten that looked like yours on 7th and Claremont yesterday. We noticed him because he was so small
4160,160572160,Scott Sanderson,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,35w,Good thing unrelated individuals were allowed to live together when I was paying off my student loans. I went into a LOT of student debt and saved hundreds of dollars every month for years living with roommates I met on craigslist.(edited)
4161,160572160,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,35w,Unrelated people are allowed to live together now Scott. Just not 10 of them in a small house with an unlimited number of their relatives in addition to the 10. Unscrupulous landlords will prey on desperate people and cram as many people as possible into every square foot of a house without regard to the infrastructure (ie a single bathroom) supporting the number of people living there. Zoning laws protect neighborhoods AND ensure that residents' basic needs are also assured.(edited)
4162,160572160,Carol Ohare,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,7 Sep,"Sara, great comment. This is a democratic move to change our cities and suburbs around the nation.This was an add on from the prior administration to the `1968 fair Housing act. /We must vote this down. I don't know where the money goes. You might check Act Blue."
4163,160572160,Joyce Cerretti,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,7 Sep,"I believe it's actually a socialistic move to change our cities. As for making donations through change.org, it appears your contribution most likely will not go to who you want it to go to. They often continue to take your $$$ each month. Many complaints online. If you evermore donations, please check them out st guidestar.org to make sure they are legit."
4164,160572160,Marissa Star,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,8 Sep,RIGHT now only 2 unrelated individuals can legally live together under one roof in Denver.
4165,160572160,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,8 Sep,"I agree.  A number below 5 is definitely more reasonable then 10. 10 is obscene and if the number was maybe double the current 2 allowed, more people would probably get on board with the change.  But outside forces are pushing the 10 limit because they'll be able to make the maximum amount of money from each property.  If our government approves 10, they've sold their citizens and their souls  out."

4170,160572160,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,8 Sep,Areas with HOAs that regulate number of residents are exempt plus some other specially zoned areas (can't remember what the zoning area is called).  Those exemptions total about 25% of Denver neighborhoods.  City council members pointed out that this would be unfair and cause even more of an impact on other less well to do areas.
4171,160572160,Jerimiah Stone,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill Central,8 Sep,"I can see some of the pros and cons after 20 mins of preliminary thought. 1) Housing costs are at an all time high in Denver along with 3% vacancy rate of rentals (pre-covid), therefore, one might posit that we need more ability to house people more affordably.  2) I understand some cultures have a nuclear family model, but in many cultures the extended family reside in the same locale if not the same ""home?"" 3) Will landlords/managers be able to screen each resident or be limited by cost of running everyone's background check and will landlords require a fee to screen each resident, who keeps track of such, and won't this incur additional costs for those who are already 'marginally' housed? PS. Marissa Star You should see 'capsule hotels' in Japan, in a densely populated metropolis."
4172,160572160,Marissa Star,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,8 Sep,"I've seen them :) I've also seen unfinished basements with families living in them. I also see alot of homeless here in Denver and wonder how much the rental capacity would impact that , perhaps less on the streets ? YOU are right , that's alot of background checks! Say one had no siblings , they are forced into a one roomate situation,  that is not right. "

Depending on the size you want they are pretty reasonable compared to most and you can try it for 90 days (or something like that) and if you don‚Äôt like it, they donate it and refund you. When we purchased they had a 0% interest payment plan for 12 months that we used. Good luck!"
4188,166584215,TJ Patel,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,2 Nov,Got a great one from Walmart for around 200$ and we've had it for 3 years!

I think we need to hear him confirm one way or the other and it should be specified in the proposal. It would protect several neighborhoods and make others even more vulnerable."
4199,158322127,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,38w,"Larry and I asked Webb on the chat feature of the zoom meeting for Hilltop presentation. And they responded, No, HOA‚Äôs could not protect you against this. Someone could ask again.(edited)"

4204,158322127,meira hertzberg,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,18 Aug,It is NOT just group living. It will allow up to 10 unrelated in ALL residential housing types.

4210,158322127,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,18 Aug,The City of Denver's amended Group Living Proposal circumvents the 2010 Zoning Code negotiated for each neighborhood. Several proposed changes are below. It also allows the Department of Corrections to place those that are released into half-way houses in our neighborhoods.
4211,158322127,Amy Duclos,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,18 Aug,Here's the related petition:  https://www.change.org/p/denver-mayor-and-city-council-members-no-to-denver-s-group-living-zoning-code-amendment?redirect=false

4215,158127610,Brian Johnson,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,14 Aug,"Bigger question, why are they homeless? Because they are victims of a corrupt system that takes everything and leaves no empathy in its wake of destruction as you are lied to with the kind words "" we are the government, we are here to help you"". Only to find out that all your hard earned money and tax dollars spent foolishly on other things, instead for those in need were loaned to those in need and every time they get a leg up, someone takes it all away with the swipe of a pen to recover funds that were never meant to be paid back. Why are we trusting information that is not close to being Government affiliate supplied or even based on educated repeatable scientifically documented practices. Lockdowns that are created by the expertise of people who know nothing about synthesizing cultures for virus growth, as we scream ""mask"" from the tallest apartments at 8 PM as world software providers can't design a program to avoid your electronics from getting sick, and yet they dictate how you should interact in your pursuit of happiness with social interaction along with, what and when you can have your God and the given right's restored while the economy is destroyed, our lives are ruined, and our kids futures are in debt justified by an invisible enemy all so you can have a better life for you and your children as you move from middle class to homeless as you lose faith in the very thing you worked so hard for."

4217,158127610,Buffy Gilfoil,‚Ä¢ Lowry,15 Aug,"If I remember correctly, information sent by my council person Amanda Sawyer said they are allowed in industrial zones. Zoning decisions have traditionally been made at the local level."

4221,158127610,Buffy Gilfoil,‚Ä¢ Lowry,15 Aug,"The group housing proposal under consideration in Denver appears to be in keeping with the spirit of the Obama-era Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule. The rule provides incentives that in effect impose on local zoning decisions made at the national level. Trump, with full support from HUD Secretary Ben Carson, rolled back the rule. I would guess that it will be back in full force with a Biden presidency."
4222,158127610,Mike Guertin,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,15 Aug,"Ben Carson‚Äôs support was probably along the lines of, ‚ÄúHuh? Wha?‚Äù"

4225,158127610,Walter Hwozdyk,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,15 Aug,"Several years ago I had a rental property in a tract home development in Henderson, between Denver and Brighton.  This community was a covenant controlled housing development with defined regulations regarding many things including parking restrictions.  I hired a property management company who provided a lease that complied with the neighborhood HOA regulations.  Although the tenants signed the lease indicating the occupants would be a husband & wife with two small children and no pets, they failed to comply with that stipulation.  "

4227,158127610,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Aug,"Also, it looks like YIMBY are proud they found a way to rig Councilwoman Sawyer‚Äôs poll, ‚Äúyou can fill out as many times as you want in incognito mode.‚Äù"
4228,158127610,Buffy Gilfoil,‚Ä¢ Lowry,15 Aug,I don't think the person who make that comment lives Sawyer's district and I doubt that he is a YIMBY member. I think he was just making an observation.
4229,158127610,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,16 Aug,"Buffy Gilfoil you can read the whole conversation on YIMBY Facebook page.  He was trying to eliminate the preview and open the link to everyone, not just her district which is how it is set up and then he keeps working on it to enable voting as many times as you want. What tech companies do these people work for??"

4231,158127610,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Aug,"Hi Pauline, Thank you. I‚Äôm usually very quiet. In fact, the people who know me, can‚Äôt believe this is me talking. But, I‚Äôm tired of being quiet and watching our city get destroyed. The muzzle has come off!"
4232,158127610,Sharon Johnson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Aug,Well said.  Thank you.
4233,158127610,Connie Brakken-Smith,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,15 Aug,Our City Counsel Representative Amanda Sawyer put out a questionnaire to get input from the neighborhoods she represents regarding the Group Home proposal.  I am hopeful every City Council member is doing the same. Make your voices heard if you oppose this proposal. This is what democracy looks like.
4234,158127610,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Aug,Except YIMBY has rigged the poll so that they seem to be able to answer numerous times
4235,158127610,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Aug,"See above, really??"
4236,158127610,Sarah Thompson,‚Ä¢ Hale,15 Aug,"As a native of Denver, I‚Äôm seriously disheartened by the lack of empathy. This proposal does not just include criminals. We have destroyed so many low income neighborhoods and pushed people out of the only affordable housing in this city. We can‚Äôt do that and then have a problem with these kind of proposals. We take over your backyard but then cry not in my backyard. What do you expect? Then people complain about the homeless problem. If you are that concerned, help fix it instead of just playing Monday morning quarterback. Be part of the solution, address the underlying issues and find compassionate."
4237,158127610,Rick Platz,‚Ä¢ Lowry,15 Aug,Good point. That goes to mayor and zoning and planning departments that let it happen.
4238,158127610,Priscilla Olmsted,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,15 Aug,"Thank you Sir for your message  I concur with you and pray the mayor , representatives, governor will heed to assisting these individuals  with pragmatic living areas to rebuild their lives!!! Let us set up mental health wellness , parameters for job opportunities, accountability/responsibilities the individuals will adhere to and consequences if not met. I do support the rebuilding and building of lives, so all know they have a purpose and contribution to our city , county , state and America. We must let them know they are worthy !!"
4239,158127610,Jane Skarka,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,15 Aug,It‚Äôs so interesting to see the neighborhoods these comments are coming from. You want some white milk to wash down all that white bread? What are you all so afraid of? Thank goodness for diversity and people who care about others who may not look like them. Pretty soon you will all be a minority and won‚Äôt that be interesting to watch. Maybe that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre so afraid of.üßê

4242,158127610,Tim Ditmer,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,15 Aug,"Thank you, Paul. It takes courage to have an opinion that was not formed in a mob. I presume that you have worked with and defended many people of every color, and I saw no reference to race in your concern. Even so, the attack came. I too, have spent decades working and giving to many people in many nations and almost all in poverty. I love these people, as I love the people in both Denver jails, that I have visited, counseled, taught and prayed with for the last decade."
4243,158127610,Tom Hart,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Aug,We are in a national crisis.  Why blame the problem on the most destitute victims of the crisis?  Why can't we find s as nctioned campsites for these victims that includes minimal sanitation and safety facilities to protect them and us?  The adhoc camping facilities should be called Trumpvilles because we have a President who golf's while the citizens suffer.

4276,152115162,Kristi Rudy,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,19 Jun,"Please keep in mind the street sweeping helps to keep debris from clogging the storm drains. In turn, that helps to prevent street flooding during heavy rains. I'm reminded of that overflow going into homes in the summer of 2015."

4288,155438375,Rick O.,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill SE,21 Jul,If the city loses the stock show (Aurora will gladly host them) that would be another revenue hole of $115 million in addition the $700 million per year from the shut down convention center. Massive tax increase or service cut coming.
4289,155438375,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,21 Jul,Hi Michelle did you go Sunday
4290,155438375,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,21 Jul,Where in Aurora would it be held?
4291,155438375,Rick O.,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill SE,21 Jul,Aurora + Gaylord would have built something.
4292,155438375,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,21 Jul,Rick Otto 
4293,155438375,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,21 Jul,It‚Äôs (sadly) not unbelievable that some people would rather have the Stock Show go on than to end this pandemic. This won‚Äôt be over by January. It‚Äôs about time that Denver steps up to do it‚Äôs part to help homeless individuals.
4294,155326493,Marisa Baldwin,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,19 Jul,I understand some of your concern but individuals living in sober living really deserve a second chance and support from the community.  And...they are drug tested as conditional terms to live there.
4295,155326493,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,19 Jul,I can see that.
4296,169238186,Denise Harris,‚Ä¢ Skyland,29 Nov,Walmart or hobby lobby or Michaels
4297,154627634,Chris Rios,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NE,12 Jul,I hope the houseless encampment surrounding Morey is on the agenda. A petition has been started here ‚Äî-> http://chng.it/k7PfHdPbGH

4300,154627634,Dave D.,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NE,12 Jul,They stopped the in person meetings because people were calling them out for doing things like canceling their meetings and not voting the way their constituents want.
4301,154627634,Gaar Potter,‚Ä¢ Happy Canyon,14 Jul,Not to mention being mobbed by demonstrators........
4302,154627634,Rolly Carve,‚Ä¢ Highland,12 Jul,"Let‚Äôs flood then with 1 message: asylums.  Get them on the record supporting it or not.  You know, any politician of either party who made this their issue would win."

4304,154627634,Rolly Carve,‚Ä¢ Highland,13 Jul,"Patrick H. The homeless problem is out of control and we need to bring back state asylums that can care for these people away from downtown.

4305,154627634,Tony Maa,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,43w,Will the meeting be televised on Channel 8 for those of us without Zoom access ?(edited)

4308,154627634,Hawk C.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,13 Jul,It‚Äôs just what they want....this way they can pass legislation without any face-to-face interaction with their constituents.  Typical of the left leaning city council and the local government.
4309,154627634,Jeffrey Sturman,‚Ä¢ CBD,13 Jul,Right because cons like trump are so transparent
4310,154627634,Gayle Gar,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,13 Jul,"Was driving pass Wash Park on Downing last week.  2 homeless men - 1 could barely stand with the help of the bench, the other on the ground trying to get up but couldn't.  If I wouldn't have had a friend's child, I would have stopped to help.  There were several people walking/jogging within a few feet but didn't bother to help.  I wonder if these were some of the same people who felt the need to attempt to shame me for suggesting money be given to homeless shelters rather than dangerous street corners.  Just sayin', lol."
4311,154627634,Rolly Carve,‚Ä¢ Highland,13 Jul,You‚Äôre welcomed to advocate for bringing back state asylums with us.  Think of it as a large park surrounded by living/medical facilities that takes care of them outside the city. It starts by getting the city council to demand such change.
4312,154627634,Florence S.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,13 Jul,Deliberative Assembly: A deliberative assembly or body -- the kind of gathering to which parliamentary law is generally understood to apply -- has the following distinguishing characteristics.
4313,154627634,Adam Estroff,‚Ä¢ Baker,13 Jul,The online meetings I've attended have still been pretty robust for communication and deliberation. Around the country there's actually been an improvement in the diversity of attendance at public meetings because of the virtual changes.
4314,154627634,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,13 Jul,"i have always liked how Robert‚Äôs Rules described deliberation, and i definitely have had qualms over the years about decisions deliberated by email; virtual meetings have are much better, though"
4315,154627634,Kathleen M.,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,13 Jul,"City Council can‚Äôt handle the people questioning their failed policies. How about canceling the $60,000 per day Convention Ctr contract for COVID beds we never needed or used? It runs through 12/31/2020. Do the math, CO could use that money for food banks or other useful issues. Stop the spending for political reasons. This is not a p***ing contest."
4316,154627634,Ann Brannan Joyce,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,13 Jul,It has not been used yet -
4317,154627634,Kevin F.,‚Ä¢ Sloans/Highlands,25 Jul,Ann B. wake up
4318,154627634,Gayle W.,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,13 Jul,"Maybe I don't understand but doesn't the City own the Convention Center and is actually just moving money around in paying that charge? What can a few lights and maybe a security guard or two cost. Are they calculating in lost revenue for conventions/trade shows? I e-mailed our council member and, of course, got no response. Can anyone shed light on this?"
4319,154627634,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,13 Jul,"the city contracts with a private company to operate the Convention Center; under the contract, the city has to pay that company when it uses the facility"
4320,154627634,Angie H.,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,14 Jul,"Legislating virtually is absolutely not better or comparable‚Äînor does it encourage transparency, accountability, engagement or deliberation. It is also a woefully inadequate replacement for in-person legislating. Virtual participation (allowing testimony for constituents who cannot be there) should augment to allow for wider participation and more transparency- but it‚Äôs a poor substitute for the whole process and no one should be okay with this ever becoming standard operating procedure (in the case anyone argues for it) Being a legislator is not an at-home work opportunity."
4321,151653891,Christine Bramson,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,"I have seen him quite a bit as well.  I think this is the same person who was seeking refuge at the Post Office a year or so ago.  Lately, he seems to be by CCGrill, or at least that‚Äôs where I have seen him.  I know there was a lot of community outreach before.  Sounds as though he could benefit from some support again."
4322,151653891,Jeanie Curley,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,He adamantly refuses any offer of help
4323,151653891,Ruth Starr,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,Does he have white hair?
4324,151653891,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,I've attempted to help him numerous times including trying to give him money or a blanket. He always shakes his head no and won't look at me. It breaks my heart to see him on the street but he's made it clear that he just wants to be left alone.
4325,151653891,Meredith Coors,‚Ä¢ Country Club,14 Jun,Is he a middle aged amputee? I tried to offer him assistance on 6th Avenue when he‚Äôd been waiting at a bus stop for over an hour and he was EXTREMELY aggressive - I wouldn‚Äôt recommend approaching him.
4326,151653891,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,Yes. That's him.
4327,151653891,Duane Gabel,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14 Jun,"We've also tried to help him but he declined all offers we made.  This was all pre-pandemic, but we have spoken with the police about helping him.  They know him and said he has also refused the services they've offered him."
4328,151653891,Joan Erber,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,I have beein seeing this man in the neighborhood for a long time.  Someone must drop him off and pick him up each day. I don't know if he sleeps on the street.  For a while he was spending time in the CCN library and I contacted the DPL social worker about him (pre-pandemic of course).  But the chances the social worker would be visiting this branch when the man happened to be there would have been slim and probably never happened.
4329,151653891,Sydney Stone,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,"Some people like suffering. It's the only power he has, to refuse your help."
4330,151653891,Rachael Cotner,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,15 Jun,nobody likes suffering - its called mental illness- no human on earth would chose suffering if they were in their correct and healthy mind
4331,151653891,Sydney Stone,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,15 Jun,Rachael Cotner My mother LOVED to suffer--I think she thought it gave her brownie points with her sky god.
4332,151653891,ginger matarazzo,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,14 Jun,I think this same guy spent a day over here in Wash Park last week. Same experience-refused assistance
4333,151653891,Brian Fun,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,"As an Inpatient Psychiatric Nurse at DH, we have lots of patients like the person you are writing about.  I totally understand the need to be compassionate and empathetic, but we must all remember to respect a person's wishes.  If he refuses assistance or donations - so be it.  There is nothing worse than having someone impose ""what they want for us"" when our wishes may simply be to ""be left alone.""  Never hurts to acknowledge the individual but no need to try and do more unless asked."
4334,151653891,Ruth Starr,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,"I agree Brian. As an RN and a direct reporter as are you, at what point should be intervention?"
4335,151653891,Pamela Kelly,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,14 Jun,He is a fixture in the neighborhood.  He never accepts any money.
4336,151653891,Had Beatty,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,"One day, when his bony butt was sitting on a hard plywood seat of his wheel chair, I gave him a good closed foam pad.  He said ""thanks"" but the next time I saw him he didn't have it and said he gave it to a woman who needed it more."
4337,151653891,Terri Clark,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Jun,He paid it forward! What more can you ask for.
4338,151653891,Ruth Starr,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,47w,"Mary Bird, is this middle aged man the only homeless person in CCN? I can recall two others; a white male in his 60‚Äôs with long white hair. He had a bike when Hickenlooper bought bikes for the homeless. Then, he was wheelchair bound due to a lost foot. Years before him there was a white woman with a long dress, coat (even in the summer), and hat (she put aluminum foil on it.) She pushed an oversized grocery cart and stayed around the Burger King. Anyone know what happened to them?(edited)"
4339,151653891,Sydney Stone,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,"And poor Dennis, who wasn't homeless but looked it; real test of one's compassion, as a head injury made him neglect bathing and grooming. He was very nice and not at all scary, just lonely and brain-damaged."
4340,151653891,Mary Bird,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,This is the man with no legs.
4341,151653891,Ruth Starr,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,15 Jun,I am walking in CCN now. 
4342,151653891,Terri Birdsong,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,14 Jun,I‚Äôve had numerous conversations with the white haired gentleman over the years. He‚Äôs a very gentle soul and quite intelligent. He use to shop at Safeway in CCN till it closed. He lived down on CC south river for a very long time and lost his foot to frost bite. He has a phone and money. He use to be in the oil business and knows many of the old oil guys.
4343,151653891,Ruth Starr,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,15 Jun,"This is so good to know. I used to see him by the library‚Äîyears ago, before it became ‚Äúsmart‚Äù. He would comb his hair and adjust his appearance before entering."
4344,151653891,Mary Delaney,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,15 Jun,"I believe there are 2 men and they are often confused with each other.  Kent (and it may be Ken), who I affectionately call Santa Claus, has a foot amputated and is in a wheelchair, and has been for the past several years.   I understand there is another man and he is a double amputee and I am told he does hang out by the CC post office.  Before he lost his foot, Kent got around with a bicycle.  He used to always come down Cherry Creek South  Dr, but now he uses Cherry Creek North Dr. One day he got off the path and took his wheelchair down toward the creek (I was watching from my apartment window), on the edge thinking he was going to crash the wheelchair and roll into the creek, but he didn't and I was shocked that he maneuvered the chair back up the incline and onto the path. He would sit for a while and watch the creek.  Once when he was there an ambulance and fire truck rolled up, got out and talked to him and left. I'm sure someone saw him and thought he was in peril and called for help, but he didn't need any.  One day I saw him up by 23rd and York. After that, I  saw him at Paneras and asked what he was doing up so far away.  He told me there was an assistance place and he was getting a new wheelchair.  I have never been sure he was homeless, the last time I talked to him he told me he was trying to get into Kavod, I don't know if that has happened or not.  He is nice, he is friendly, he seems interested in things, I enjoy it when I have the chance to talk with him."
4345,151653891,Ruth Starr,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,15 Jun,Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
4346,151653891,T.A. Oggs,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,15 Jun,The man I believe you are referencing (double amputee) was approached several times by neighbors asking if he needed help/water (it was 90 degrees) etc and he refused - phoned non-emergency number requesting welfare check for him.
4347,151653891,Sara Hankenson,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,15 Jun,I‚Äôve seen him many times on my walks. Bless his heart. Seems he‚Äôs been around quite some time.
4348,151653891,Terri Clark,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Jun,"Please do not make assumptions about this man, whether it be that he is mentally ill or angry. He is very kind and has same amazing stories. He wants to be left alone and doesn‚Äôt want to be poked and prodded. He doesn‚Äôt want handouts. He has his own money and does get a little cranky when people make assumptions that he needs ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. We would all get cranky if people constantly thought we needed rescuing."
4349,151653891,Ann Rennie,‚Ä¢ Country Club,16 Jun,"The white haired gentleman is Kent. Several people described him well as intelligent and a gentle soul. I don‚Äôt think he needs or wants help but he loves to talk.  He comes to our church occasionally.  He wouldn‚Äôt yell at someone who tried to help him, but he might say no thank you.  And he would likely give something away to someone he felt needed it more.  Talking with Kent has helped me see homeless people more as people."

4383,171663129,brad gassman,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,23 Dec,I think a better use of the money would be to address the homelessness problem that exists in the City instead of worrying about a street closure . There are still sidewalks and parks that people can go and enjoy .
4384,171663129,Dean Bartell,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,23 Dec,"Tj Kizuka  The cost was approximately $500K since April for sign rental and daily maintenance. It was primarily paid out of pandemic grant funds. The debate is whether those funds could have provided more direct relief for business and people that need help. Since the City has a $200M budget deficit now, I‚Äôm not sure where the funds will come from next."
4385,171663129,Tj Kizuka,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,19w,Thank you Dean Bartell for looping me in. So many people comment without context or facts. This does to me also seem for the most part negate the argument above about their wasted tax money since these were primarily grants. 
4386,171663129,Joyce Cerretti,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,23 Dec,Grants only mean the money doesn't have to be paid back. The Pandemic money comes from our federal taxes and some states contribute as well.

4389,171663129,Daniel Marschman,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,23 Dec,It‚Äôs time for them to be open. The blockades are a hazard in snow and ice for residents that live on these streets.  Close them again in the springs if still needed for COVID-19.  I don‚Äôt see much pedestrian use or bikes etc. since winter set in.
4390,171663129,Tom Connell,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,23 Dec,"I have lived between 7th and 8th Avenue for 40 years and have always enjoyed supporting the small businesses on 12th Avenue - Capital Heights Pharmacy, Wild Flowers, Ace Hardware, Pappas Market, and the great Dry Cleaners located there. With 11th closed it cuts off the entire neighborhood and makes me go out around Congress Park to the west to 12th, or out on Colorado Blvd to 13th on the east - both sending a very simple shopping trip into a much longer trip into traffic that I try to avoid. I am glad to see the closures end."

These people have a compulsion to purchase these necessary things...nothing we say is going to stop them...they are compelled to buy.   Could the stores keep tabs on them better? ....like they do when we go to the register with an extra this or that, and they make us leave it with the cashier.     I only wish that they would consider not overbuying...pretty please?   I did find 4 paks of my 'flushable' TP the other day and bought my limit of 2.  That was only 8 rolls compared to the jumbo size packs with twice that much.  None of this over-bought stuff is refundable.  This will all be over before we know it.  Then we will see roadside stands - from the hoarders - with semi-trailer loads of TP and paper towels ...  LOL!!(edited)"

4426,168507509,Cristy Slater,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,22 Nov,I've also tried to order food items that normally would be in pretty good stock quantity but they're out of those things too. It's so frustrating and leaves me without certain food items.
4427,168507509,Liz Linden,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,25 Nov,I'm sorry to hear that. I saw a lady at the store earlier shoving a ton of packages of pasta in her cart. Ridiculous!
4428,168507509,Patty Purves,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,21 Nov,I may be tempted to wipe my bottom with leaves and leave them in the yards of hoarders... ü§£
4429,168507509,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,21 Nov,UGH are people seriously doing this again? >:(
4430,168507509,Cristy Slater,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,22 Nov,Yes because now Polis is sending out Red Alerts saying that the pandemic has returned with a vengeance and once again people are panicking and thinking that they're not going to have enough to last them. They didn't learn from last time. SMH
4431,168507509,Sherry Johnson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,22w,Cristy Slater they should still have tp left from the first time! It‚Äôs ridiculous because those of us who don‚Äôt hoard find ourselves thinking ‚Äúmaybe I better just grab an extra‚Äù.....ugh....
4432,168507509,Julie Caldwell,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,21 Nov,Really? It‚Äôs starting again???
4433,168507509,Cristy Slater,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24w,Polis issued a statewide alert! üò†(edited)
4434,168507509,Susan Dean,‚Ä¢ Hale,21 Nov,And sellers of things like toilet paper and paper towels online are dramatically raising their prices.  Much of what used to be available on Amazon is now out of stock.
4435,168507509,Cristy Slater,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,22 Nov,I've tried Amazon I've tried online Target Walmart etc everyone is out of stock so because my sister lives in Aurora I've asked her to check in her area for me. She's got a car and she's not disabled.
4436,168507509,Cristy Slater,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,22 Nov,"My sister finally found some Charmin but she's saying that at Target and Walmart in Aurora, the shelves are so empty. Why are people so panicked and greedy? I order groceries to go and most of what I'm ordering is out of stock and that scares me."
4437,168507509,Tina Emery,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,21 Nov,Just FYI I was at King Soopers on monaco and there was plenty of tp and some paper towels
4438,168507509,Cristy Slater,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,22 Nov,OK I am going to admit that I do have my toilet paper preference because of certain issues so I do stick to that and those are what I can't find. üôÉ
4439,168507509,Holly Van Keuren,‚Ä¢ Hale,21 Nov,Visited Costco off Santa Fe and Target in Englewood...TP totally sold out both places today.  Humans are crazy!
4440,168507509,Robert Douglas,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,22 Nov,"Herd mentality at the big box stores. People visually see others panic buying or low visual supply in the warehouse. Then anxiety kicks in and boom, you have just created a run."
4441,168507509,Jan Shsroff,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,23 Nov,"When I spoke to an employee at Safeway, he said it is a supply chain problem. He said the supply chain is very fragile"
4442,168507509,Cristy Slater,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,23 Nov,But everywhere?
4443,168507509,Jan Shsroff,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,23 Nov,"I don‚Äôt understand why the supply chain is so fragile. I looked at stoves and it is a 10 week wait , if the store can order it. Two stores said they were sold out of the stove I wanted and Best Buy said they couldn‚Äôt even order it."
4444,168507509,Paula Hagar,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,23 Nov,"Last night at Target they had plenty of both hand wipes and cleaning wipes. I was annoyed to see they had NO prices listed on any of their cleaning products. Makes me wonder if the prices will go up by the day? They were pricey enough as it was. Did not look at TP and paper products. I'm set with those, still, from just after the last panic buying."
4445,168507509,Kelly Dwyer,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,23 Nov,"I'm sure panic buying is going on (boo!), but please don't be quick to judge an individual shopper as in some cases the person is shopping for multiple households again.  I was getting dirty looks today for my overloaded cart - no panic buying at all, just 3 households and Thanksgiving for my immediate family. :)"
4446,168507509,Cristy Slater,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,23 Nov,Exceptions to the rule don't count nor is it very often. But we thank you for that for sure!!
4447,168507509,Patty Purves,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,25 Nov,Just another perspective here: myvsister volunteers with an organization that runs errands for shut-ins.  She often ends up doing grocery shopping for multiple people at once.  It appears that she is buying LOTS of supplies (like TP) in her cart but she is actually getting one package per client.  She does have a nametag that identifies her as a volunteer.  Just a thiught that some people who seem to be hoarding might actually be doing a service for others who cant get out to shop for themselves.
4448,168507509,Cristy Slater,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,25 Nov,"But thats more the exception than the rule. And those who do what your sister does, have a huge part of my heart! Unfortunately,  there are more panic-buying people than precious people like your sister. Tell her thank you!"
4449,168507509,Anne Delphia,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,25 Nov,This won‚Äôt stop panic buying.  It has to come from the store from the top.  If this is happening where you shop just ask management to put a limit on them.  1 per person.  It works.
4450,168507509,Cristy Slater,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,25 Nov,They said they try.
4451,168507509,Anne Delphia,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,25 Nov,Cristy Slater good to know.  I went to Safeway today and they limit 1 per buyer and thanked them for doing that and they said the rule came from the top.  Hope they are able to do it.  GL

4453,158066640,Lynn Stubbart,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14 Aug,Sorry this happened to you.  Mine was taken out of my garage that was locked.  So frustrating.  They go to chop shops down off 14th 13th areas.  Maybe you can retrieve but most likely already chopped and gone.  This is all drug related I‚Äôm sure & with defunding of police...well you know the rest. üòû
4454,158066640,Gwen Freitag,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,14 Aug,Yes I did! Mine was stolen yesterday and I hit the streets- talked to some of the homeless community and ended up getting it back ü§ó Time is of the essence though (they get sent to aurora to be chopped/resold). You‚Äôll have more luck with this probably than the police finding it üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è They cut through 2 kryptonite locks with an electric side grinder so they will get any bike if it‚Äôs available
4455,158066640,Eric Wakefield,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,15 Aug,I‚Äôm so sorry that your bike was stolen & it makes me angry as well. I sure hope that Karma plays a out to the dirt bag low life that took it. I as well have had bikes stolen in the past & victim of home burglary. Agreed you feel violated when something you‚Äôve worked hard for is taken away from you. Hopefully your bike will turn up & I‚Äôll keep an eye out for it.
4456,158066640,Rachel Griffin,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,38w,"I‚Äôm so sorry. The city wants to invest all this money in bike infrastructure but there is no money for recovery efforts, secure locked areas once you reach your destination, breaking up the chop shops etc. I quit using my bike as transportation long ago. Now it‚Äôs just for recreation.(edited)"
4457,158066640,Adrianna Hampton,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,17 Aug,Yeah this happened to me and my fam it dose suck especially when you do evey thing you can to get a new bike and then someone just steal it
4458,158066640,Joetta Toland,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,17 Aug,I have only lived here about a year and my car was broken into and my bike was stolen from my garage too.

4473,158066640,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,22 Aug,There is a ND post by Liz LaRue on 38th and popular that states it looks next to her that there are a lot of stolen bikes. She is not able to get the DP to respond. You should try to find her posting.
4474,158182691,Allen Shaw,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Aug,"Great letter.  It seems that council members vote their agenda and not the will of their constituents.  There are 2 ways to correct that.  One is voting at election time, the other is recall."
4475,158182691,Roger Studer,‚Ä¢ Lowry,15 Aug,I agree

4477,158182691,Francesca Cheroutes,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Aug,"shame on you. NIMBY is another way to promote us v them, systemic racism and shame people who have had issues. This is EVERYONE‚ÄôS problem, and we all have to do our part."
4478,158182691,Guy James,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Aug,"Francesca, why are the people whom disagree with you racist? Please, out neighborhood is a very nice neighborhood and wanting to keep it that way is simple common sense, not an attack on anybody else."
4479,158182691,Allen Shaw,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Aug,"Francesca, beginning your response with shame on you  was sufficient enough to let everyone know how you feel about Mr Linton and others who don‚Äôt have the same thoughts you have."
4480,158182691,Francesca Cheroutes,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Aug,"I don‚Äôt know Mr. Linton, or many others on this thread, nor did I pretend to. The sentiments expressed by Mr. Linton and others are EXACTLY part of the problem. You say you agree with equality and the American dream for everyone, but not if it affects you. One is part of the problem or part of the solution. How do we reconcile equality and NIMBY?  I‚Äôd love it if someone could actually address a point of view other than Mr. Linton‚Äôs."
4481,158182691,Aldo Knaper,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,15 Aug,"Thank you Larry & Paul!  My thoughts exactly.  I have lived in this very charming neighborhood for 30+ years.  Having cheap high density housing does not make for a pleasant city, and will just turn these neighborhoods into crowded non-relaxing noisy urban sprall.  Remember once those changes are made, there is no turning back!"

4483,158182691,Tyler Cox,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Aug,"Denver‚Äôs a city, a growing city. Density is a hallmark of inclusiveness and diversity. Inclusivity and opposition to flexibility in zoning codes that allow for density and other forms of development are diametrically opposed. Further more, substantial research demonstrates that neither density or halfway houses diminish property values.  If you‚Äôd prefer a city that caters to wealthy white homeowners only, feel free to move to cherry hills village with the rest of your conservative friends...and if you fancied yourself a liberal, take a look at the history of exclusionary zoning and it‚Äôs racist roots, then take a look in the mirror and ask if you‚Äôre the type of person that would like to perpetuate that racist history."
4484,158182691,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Aug,Congress Park is already very dense and racially inclusive. 
4485,158182691,Leanne Fosbre,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,15 Aug,Well spoken. Please run for office. I will work for your campaign.
4486,158182691,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,16 Aug,Me too!
4487,158182691,Sara Henry,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,15 Aug,"Apparently these days all tax paying citizens need to sit down and shut up or you're a racist. Just take whatever they force down your throats because otherwise they'll be at your door. Forget that we have always given to charities, forget that we love ALL our neighbors be they a different color than us, forget that we pay taxes every day that supports our elected officials and social programs throughout the entire neighborhood.  That's not enough because no matter what, we are all racist because we were born white. "
4488,158182691,Wade Gardner,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Aug,This is not an excellent letter. I read a lot about you were this and you are that. But really nothing of substance. 
4489,158182691,Chris opi,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,15 Aug,Well said
4490,158182691,Eric Godoy,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,16 Aug,You care about people as long as they don‚Äôt live next to you and ruin your ‚Äúneighborhood character‚Äù. Got it.
4491,158182691,Mike McCafferty,‚Ä¢ Lowry,16 Aug,"If there is accountability in these situations where there are reasonable ways to address concerns, I wholeheartedly agree with community housing options. I don't think it makes sense to make permanent arrangements that cannot be changed without an impossible act of congress. If there is some flexibility in how concerned neighbors can expect reasonable standards for safety and hygiene, for all neighbors to adhere to and experience reasonable consequences to address those concerns, I absolutely agree. "
4492,158182691,Joan Baronberg,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,16 Aug,"Focusing on the color of one's skin is not getting any of us anywhere. If you are after ""diversity,"" why define it by one's skin color? In the political candidate realm, let's define diversity based on policies, not skin color. It is against the law to discriminate negatively, and it used to be against the law to discriminate positively, based on race or religion. People changed that with ""affirmative action,"" and look where that got to. Few people still seem able to define ""discriminate"" or ""diversify."""
4493,158182691,Francesca Cheroutes,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,16 Aug,"Not focusing on the color of one‚Äôs skin is the ideal, Joan. I join with you in hoping that someday we get there. But we aren‚Äôt anywhere close yet, as we‚Äôve seen in recent times, and in the stories we‚Äôve heard throughout the decades."
4494,158182691,Tyler Cox,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,16 Aug,"Francesca Cheroutes I completely agree! Not focusing on skin colors and the racist history of Denver is a denial of that reality. Denver, like many cities, is an outgrowth of racist roots. Those roots are yielding a fruit that, while less overt, is still an echo of that racism. An open and inclusive discussion must recognize that race is, and remains, a factor in both the history of this nation and this city. Less than 100 years ago the Klan and Nazi apologist played a prevalent role in shaping the Denver of today. Only a conscious recognition of that fact can being the process of dismantling it."
4495,158182691,Mike McCafferty,‚Ä¢ Lowry,16 Aug,"I believe that a recognition of the past without blaming people of today who fight against every form of racism and discrimination is a productive way to move forward. Blaming EVERY issue on past circumstances would allow me to have my father arrested for my criminal acts today. Nor do I want to be denied a credit card because of my father's lousy credit.Regardless of how abusive he may have been, it does not remove my personal responsibility today."
4496,158182691,Francesca Cheroutes,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,16 Aug,"I agree with you completely. Blame is not really helpful on a micro, or personal level. We need to ficus on the problems (and that‚Äôs a HUGE ask) and ask what we can do going forward. But it won‚Äôt always be comfortable, or easy, and it will require personal reflection and awareness going forward. As for the issue that started this thread, we work WITH the lawmakers, we are open about what our true fears are, we listen to the other side, and we come up with a compromise. THAT is American. THAT is being a community. And clearly everyone on this board has something to say and wants to be heard."

4500,162487037,Andrea O'Brien,‚Ä¢ City Park,32w,"No!  I was raised in a neighborhood with halfway houses in Pueblo. (The State Mental Hospital is there.) It‚Äôs too dangerous. People who are assumed to be swallowing their medications don‚Äôt, they just ‚Äúcheek it‚Äù if given to them or sell it if they‚Äôre on an honor system to self-medicate. There is a lot of bizarre behavior; following children, stealing pets, yelling obscenities at no one, sleeping on your porch , threatening to kill people and in one instance, one of them murdered a lady in an apartment a block from where we lived and left her, dismembered, and decomposing in a trash bag under the back porch of the apartment complex.  A woman followed me home from school yelling that I stole her clothes and calling me names.  They also find ways to get alcohol and break into homes, stores and garages and steal your mail.  And...there is already not enough street parking !  There used to be a halfway house mid way up the block on the east side of the 1600 block of Madison St.  A resident watched everyone in the neighborhood come and go and got to know their schedules. When they would leave, he‚Äôd break into their house!  We are in a ‚Äúdouble‚Äù townhouse arrangement and he got into both sides.  When my husband got home he heard noise and shouted out and the guy ran out the back door.  He was eventually caught in another burglary and went back to prison.(edited)"

4533,147452844,Ken Strohson,‚Ä¢ Whittier,9 May 20,I want my taxes going up to clean poop at  21.00 per hr when benefis are included. City Park is only  one of many with geese problem. Hopefully more foxes will get the eggs when golf course fence goes down and coyotedo there thing. Unfortunately the natural Urban Wildlife is not doing its job properly. If you have kids playing soccer or a baby getter intlo their poop and heaven forbid eat it or stick their fingers in it and put the small fingers in their mouths. Surveys we're done and your oppion was in the minority by far. Thank Goodness.
4534,147452844,Vic Lazzaro,‚Ä¢ City Park,8 May 20,"Part of the problem is that natural predators had been eliminated - what was the last fox, hawk, or coyote you saw in the park?  With no natural predators, there were too many geese for the space and the poop was too much for an urban park.  What did all those geese do to the water quality of the lakes?  And to the quality/safety of the fish that some folks fish for food?  When we interefere in the natural processes perhaps we have a responsibility to restore balance and even be the missing predator."
4535,147452844,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,9 May 20,"I have seen people fish in that lake but it never looked clean before geese. I don‚Äôt really believe it was that many fish in that lake if so they should have caught the fish to feed hungry, either one looked scary to eat. We use to have a red fox that ran thru our neighborhood but there were a lot of feral cats when they disappeared the fox did too."
4536,147452844,Kammy Alford,‚Ä¢ City Park West,8 May 20,And why were the natural predators eliminated?  Mankind?  What were the goose to do?  So sad on so many different levels.  Sigh...
4537,147452844,Adam Chou,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 May 20,"So in order to maintain balance of the geese population, would you be ok with bringing back the natural predators to roam the city? I get its not pleasant to think about, but besides culling, what solution would you find acceptable?"
4538,147452844,Ken Strohson,‚Ä¢ Whittier,9 May 20,Goose tastes very good. If these people saw how vaste majority of  pigs and chickens  are raised they wouldn't be complaining as much about a few hundred geese City wide. Maybe they would complianing is a way for life if one doesn't use reason to  analyze a problem. I had to inspect a hog farm in Logan County near Peetz and had a bad head ache for 6 hrs with sinusitis hurting also.  The factory farm was fully in compliance. The farm owner if he had not gone that route would have lost his family's farm according to his brother that I respected. He was older and had less debt so while offered a similar deal turned it down.
4539,147452844,Widicker Ava,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 May 20,"SMOKED goose is awesome!!!  Use to have it for Christmas.  At home in ND our pets negotiated away from Great Horned Owls, Eagles (Golden and Bald), Hawks, weasels (got my rabbit), fox (got my cat) and coyote & raccoons & skunks.   Now how do you think these will live in Denver.  If you want all these predators in your life - just move to the country and enjoy them and the deer eating your nice trees and flowers, et al.  Nothing like accidentally stepping on deer poop or another animal cleaning your flower beds.  This is a metropolitan city - this is not a small town of 125 people where wildlife can hide and survive.  As a farm kid you learn about life (calving season was a favorite) (cows in heat) and death early in life.  I didn't have to read a book to know about the birds and the bees - it just happens in front of you.  Ken Strohson is right about pigs - I've seen worms on patient's brain CT Scans from eating undercooked pork.  Won't touch it."
4540,147452844,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,10 May 20,"I think I‚Äôve heard that it was good but never tried it, duck and rabbit for me, it just sounded so inhuman I‚Äôve tasted veal also but it had a wild taste to me. When I ate rabbit my mom tricked us and said it was baked chicken, she was from the south so these really familiar dishes to her, I think I remember her talking about goose as well. This thread is making me sad and reminding me how much I miss her."

Anything that a legitimate RTD patron puts in the can in my front yard I will happily take care of, because that means it is not dumped in my yard.

All depends on your plumbing I guess.  Or if you are willing to split a larger dog's poo into a 2 separate flushes.

4636,155896334,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,25 Jul,"Per Florence S.:  Another concern with this proposal is allowing all of the changes as ""use by right"". This means, as a use, they are automatically allowed. Instead of issuing permits as needed, use by right has very little accountability. A permit can be revoked if the holder abuses the Code; use by right has no recourse."
4637,155896334,Stephen Eppler,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Jul,"The proposed Group Living Amendment is complicated and applies to Congregate Living situations (e.g. Half way houses, sober living communities, etc.) and to more residential arrangements.  The permitted density is very high especially if the relatives of a resident and  affiliated minors are included.  "
4638,155896334,Anne Delphia,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,41w,"It‚Äôs not that complicated.  Let me simplify it for you.  (This isn‚Äôt meant harshly just straight forward.). Its about ‚Äòfor profit‚Äô  companies wanting to cram as many convicted felons in our residential neighborhoods üè´ so these companies can make a greater profit off housing these felons.  These are serious offenders including those with convictions of violent assaults, car jacking, child molesters, sexual predators.  This new amendment allows these felons to live next to us in homes, on our blocks in our neighborhoods and next to our schools.  This new amendment also does not require that we are notified that these felons have been placed in group homes in our neighborhoods.  If there are less than 10 in one home.  Also no supervision is required of these individuals living in these homes except they need to check in at night.

GLAC is a commercial 'for profit' advisory group with 48 members/companies.   GLAC represents companies that house  residential care facilities that include (disabled, assistant living, sober living) and convicted felons and other care residential facilities.

It is a device that prevents your steering wheel from being turned. There are a few companies that make versions of them. I think you can get them at Walmart. I think they are around $30 each.

4713,146860579,KR C.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,3 May 20,"Kay V. Not only by Saudi Arabia and Russia but also by the virus.  There have been lockdowns worldwide.  That affects the demand worldwide therefore affects the US and demand in the US therefore that is why there are layoffs and business struggling (including ours) and closing or declaring bankruptcy.  The price of crude is the lowest ever.  When the price of crude drops this low, oil and gas businesses are hard pressed to sustain themselves.  So all these items contribute to the layoffs."

4731,147291389,Lauren Amble,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 May 20,Thanks for posting this. Will you be following up with the police? Our son‚Äôs Specialized mountain bike was stolen out of our garage 5 weeks ago and a friend thinks he saw someone that looked like this minutes later on the bike.

Thought I was moving to a safer neighborhood.  Guess it's part of city life - we have to be careful everywhere.  But the police were very helpful in getting us our instrument back, thanks to the serial number.  And a homeless woman actually gave my nice bike back to a neighbor - the thieves must have given it to her being a woman's bike and she didn't want it."

I'm not sure that it is based in fact, though. I don't think anyone is under the illusion that requiring businesses to close or people to stay at home puts money in anyone's ""coffers"", to say nothing of the tax base we rely on to fund important city services. The Mayor makes decisions based on science and health data- in coordination with the Governor, who by the way, understands that Denver is a densely populated city- where cases/contact/transmission are a greater risk. The Mayor and Governor Polis talk regularly- and the Governor has confidence Mayor Hancock will do what's best for the city he's responsible for protecting. The Governor must make broader decisions for the entire state. We are always coordinating and communicating, and fortunately for all of us, it has worked to our advantage as a state responding with our very best efforts during this unprecedented pandemic."

4882,145029783,David Petersen,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,17 Apr 20,"I don't see why we can't extend it till late May for example. Denver along with other cities don't have enough testing kits and other resources to handle the continued cases. I see it actually getting worse once people go about socializing and not wearing masks. Only about 10% of people in my neighborhood wear masks and most are senior citizens...it's baffling.  A lot of people are not taking this seriously enough until it actually affects them or their family/friends. Too many people (perhaps 10% or more of the population) are walking around asymptomatic, infecting people around them."

4884,145029783,Dick Nickoloff,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park South,17 Apr 20,"For once I can agree with Mayor Hancock and Gov. Poliis's way of handling this Quarantine. The issue in Michigan is the strict lockdown covered the entire state when the big issue is SE Michigan and primarily Detroit, (Which by the way wasn't the site of the protest, but it was in Lansing!) Denver unfortunately is very vulnerable thus tighter controls. We are lucky to live mostly in SE Denver, but other parts of this city have some serious issues."

4887,145029783,Sara J.,‚Ä¢ Harvey Park,17 Apr 20,"I believe people are growing increasingly concerned with the fact that losing their homes is becoming a very real possibility.

Stop saying young people aren‚Äôt worth a test when I have one friend age 30 who died and a second who was in the ICU age 32 for an entire month and was just released yesterday. Neither had preexisting health issues. Yet several of my demographic have shown symptoms and have been denied testing. How can we go on with our daily lives without knowing if we had it or not?? I speaking of current tests while showing symptoms and antibody testing. If airlines can test passengers and get results within 15 minutes so can we. GET TESTS SO WE CAN REOPEN OUR ECONOMY AND ISOLATE INFECTED PERSONS AND AREAS. Why is the government incapable of doing anything. Just get it done! People are suffering medically and financially.

4967,159428812,Paul Brown,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Aug,"Yes, I'm under the crazy notion that a person who advocates for school shootings should not be given a platform."
4968,159428812,Bridget Walsh,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Aug,"The CCC is a real mixed bag. They have published many articles ghost written by known progressive journalists and community members. They back some of Denver progressive Candi CdeBaca's proposals or at least give them air time and giver credit for representing the interests of her constiuents and not the Hancock gang . And more. On the other hand, they have also aired the views of the far right and featured , for  example, articles by Denise Riech, the Real estate agent who was recently seen taking Black Lives Matters signs off of yards. I read it because I always want to know what the other side is thinking and doing and I appreciate their effort to bring otherwise ignored community opinions to the fore."
4969,159428812,John Sawyer,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Aug,Yeah who would want to read an article with actual facts and source citations supporting a trend that just happens to run counter to the prevailing narrative.
4970,159428812,Paul Brown,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Aug,Let's turn that around...who would care to read ANYTHING in a newspaper whose publisher hoped for a school shooting to distract from Trump's impeachment?

4974,159428812,Judy Werner,‚Ä¢ Hale,27 Aug,"You are so right on, Paul.  Amanda Sawyer, the city Council person that we the people elected into office is there to serve the developers and she knows what she is doing.

4981,159428812,Dana Arvin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,28 Aug,"I think this is a web of issues.  A year ago, CC denied the renewal of contracts for the halfway houses/treatment facilities in the community corrections space.  Ms. C'deBaca said the companies were not acceptable because their parent companies contract with the federal government at the boarder.  You all know the narrative on the boarder issue. From what I can see, the issues are not resolved and CC is looking for alternatives.  This failure to renew those contracts and failure to come up with alternatives, so far, with multiply the homeless population as well as add to the narrative that there isn't enough inexpensive housing.  These are issues that CC has created to open the door to begin the march, with the YIMBYs to make Denver like Portland.  This Group Living issue is just the first of many attempts to destroy our City."

4986,159428812,Janet Meredith,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,5 Sep,There were serious issues with the for-profit halfway houses and community corrections facilities. The solutions are not easy but are important. This is about people‚Äôs lives. So is the issue of homelessness- which is complex and getting mush worse with recent job losses. Ms C de Baca is impressive- she is looking for better solutions and she respects the people she serves.

4989,146010937,Krystal MacDonald,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Apr 20,Cars are very frequent but garages and homes also get hit. Not now really since everyone is home. But certainly important to lock up.
4990,146010937,Jade Peterson,‚Ä¢ Country Club,25 Apr 20,Angel Martinez stolen documents like registration and insurance can lead to identity theft. I‚Äôd file a police report; because you want as much evidence as possible backing you up.

4992,146010937,Michael Michalek,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Apr 20,Sadly I would say it is normal  now. We had our cars gone through.  Learned my lesson to lock cars now.
4993,146010937,Vicki Kelley,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Apr 20,Unseemly folks looking for unlocked car doors is a problem in every big city.  The simple thing to do is to lock your car and house!!!  Double check if you need to but take away the thief's opportunity.  Particularly in the warm months there are many more people outside at all times of day and night.
4994,146010937,Sara Fidanza,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Apr 20,"Would never leave a car unlocked this is a big city with real big city issues, cars are stolen even when they are locked."

4996,146010937,Laura Blodgett,‚Ä¢ Country Club,25 Apr 20,It‚Äôs happened to us a couple of times. They took all my car papers too and found several of the things taken thrown out a car window a few blocks away. A neighbor returned my car manual they found in front of their house. Go for a walk you might find some things.

A friend whose tools were stolen when his truck was broken into, and a friend whose car was stolen in broad daylight in January, while neighbors were in their yards. All in this neighborhood. I lock my car any time I get out of it and I leave nothing of value in eyesight."
4999,146010937,Carolyn Hill,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Apr 20,"I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. It is not a nice welcome to the neighborhood. But folks are right: Lock your vehicle. Do not leave anything of value in the car, even if locked. Life in the big city."
5000,146010937,Edward Hoffman,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Apr 20,"One, it helps others to know the intersection you are near. Congress Park is still a big place. Two, yes, breakins on unlocked cars, packages filched from porches, even loose items from alleys all seem to be fair game. Probably worse in this economic downturn. Three, yes you should be concerned about identity theft. Good luck, be careful."

5004,146010937,Joanne Ernstsen,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,26 Apr 20,I think it is wise to lock your car in any urban neighborhood in the country.  There are unsavory opportunists and unfortunate people who have very little  who are tempted by an unlocked car.

There are other properties available in Stapleton and Northfield.  The schools are excellent, it‚Äôs a very family driven neighborhood and it‚Äôs new construction.  The streets are full of kids riding their bikes and playing. Not only would that be good for keeping your kids busy and happy, the infrastructure of friends you meet through the parents of the kids will be very beneficial. Maybe check Zillow. "

5110,159248671,"Steve Staeger, 9NEWS",,25 Aug,I had a furnace guy tell me to do it once a month to make life easier on the furnace.
5111,159248671,Tyson T.,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,37w,"This is why some landlords are known as slime-balls vultures.  I don't think every month is needed (if it is you have other issues causing this that need to be fixed) but twice a year is what i do, between seasons.  every quarter isn't bad either, i just found with my set up twice is year is fine, my filter isn't even that dirty after 6 months.  Also a pro tip, DO NOT buy the most expensive strongest filters, it makes your unit work extra hard.  I buy the mid grade, red package Filtrete.(edited)"
5112,159248671,Nathan O.,‚Ä¢ Foothill Green South,25 Aug,Thank you doing it now Steve.
5113,159248671,Karen L.,‚Ä¢ Terra Lago,25 Aug,We replace our filters (our unit has two) regularly as well.  I read your post to my husband and he went and took a look.  Both filters were just filthy and he replaced them.  Thank you for sending this suggestion along.

5120,159248671,Lorraine G.,‚Ä¢ Falcon Ridge,26 Aug,"Some have a removable mesh screen filter that you flush with water, dry and slide back in.  It will make it easier for the unit to run, too."

5124,159248671,Mary Anne H.,‚Ä¢ Applewood Valley,26 Aug,cheap furnace filters are the best. The high efficiency filters can cause your furnace to work too hard.
5125,159248671,Micki P.,‚Ä¢ Sierra Vista,27 Aug,I get mine in Walmart. $4.58 each...but as I mentioned I do change mine every month
5126,159248671,Kimberly F.,‚Ä¢ Westfield Park,26 Aug,"I thought we only had to worry about this in the winter so I haven't check mine since like February, yikes! Thanks for the suggestion."
5127,159248671,Tyson T.,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,26 Aug,"I do mine once every 6 months in a 2200 sqft hosue with both heat and air..  When seasons change is when i do mine.... my filter is not even dirty.  So it depends.  I would check every 3 months, and change every 6 month at the latest."
5128,159248671,Micki P.,‚Ä¢ Sierra Vista,26 Aug,I change my filters every month
5129,159248671,Jeannine S.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,26 Aug,Kimberly - do you have central air - if you do it goes through the furnace and the filters need to be changed year round!
5130,159248671,Kimberly F.,‚Ä¢ Westfield Park,26 Aug,"Thank you so much, that makes much more sense now. We actually do not have central air so I'm sure we're fine but I'll still give it a check."
5131,159248671,Jamie C.,‚Ä¢ Willow Creek,26 Aug,We usually don‚Äôt replace ours every month but something told us to take a look because of the smoke and ours was awful!

Originally and famously from Anchorage AK but they've been here in Denver for many years.  One of the owners is the most knowledgeable person I've ever heard on the subject of coffee."

5348,141726839,Scott Hughes,‚Ä¢ Hale,25 Mar 20,"There are some young people who are out of abusive homes, maybe even underage runaways, that get recruited into outfits that promise them a decent room & money for working but then, of course, they're taken to a strange city and exploited. If reports of them become more common again (like they were years ago) then posting about the occurrences here might help to determine if police need to be notified."
5349,141726839,Kelly Pietrs,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,26 Mar 20,"It really magazine sale is a scam.I looked into it a couple of years ago because I am a sucker for wanting to help kids out.  I subscribed to different magazines-- with a couple different solicitors.  I never saw a magazine.  Its my understanding that there is some sham company that contract with these kids to go door to door.  They meet at a location,  a van drops them off in neighborhoods and then herds them all back in the van.  The kids get an hourly rate + a small bonus if they meet a certain goal.  What I have learned =-- I tell phone and door-to-door solicitors that I do not donate or pay $ for anything without  making sure they are legit but they can leave their info.."
5350,141726839,Scott Hughes,‚Ä¢ Hale,26 Mar 20,I realized that I brought up underage runaways as an emotional appeal argument but even though that possibility exists there is also the possibility that a person doing that could be classified as an 'at-risk' adult and caught up in a crew that's organized to some degree. If any of the people that are doing this have ever been diagnosed with mental illness by a psychiatrist then they would be in the category of vulnerable or 'at-risk' adult. (That actually becomes more likely when taking into account the push for ADHD diagnoses with the younger generation.) People in that demographic are historically marginalized and in turn are part of a defined minority class. Some people are easily taken advantage of and there may be other motivating factors.

5353,158578570,Christopher Neuman,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,21 Aug,"I have an interesting solution, why I think a lot of the complaints about the rezoning of homeless and halfway houses to SUDs are that it will bring down property values, increase parking issues, increase noise etc."
5354,158578570,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,21 Aug,"Drop all of the Bravo Sierra about rentals and stats. I don't want to live  next door to a frat house with booze bottles and cigarettes butts all over their property and mine, never being able to park near my home again and people coming and going all night long waking me up. That is what the rental next to me was before it went back to a single family owner AND that was before you could have 30 people living there legally."
5355,158578570,Christopher Neuman,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,21 Aug,Is your home in a 90% rental area for say a quarter mile radius?
5356,158578570,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,21 Aug,"Christopher Neuman I have no idea. That doesn't matter. If this zoning passes Denver will turn into a giant slum, every where."
5357,158578570,Steve Ambrose,‚Ä¢ Lowry,21 Aug,"The reality is law enforcement can not enforce what is in place now. They will not pursue a Vehicle hit and run when you provide them with the license plate. Next with city council having this much zoning power what‚Äôs to keep them from allowing an Oilwell on a property, like Houston. It is already Houston zoning so how about a few oil wells next to the half way houses?"
5358,158578570,Betsy Rumely,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,21 Aug,"There probably isn‚Äôt a way we can make sure that the first halfway houses go in next to the City planners homes, but it would be justice‚Äîand an education. ;>)"
5359,158578570,Steve Ambrose,‚Ä¢ Lowry,21 Aug,"Technically it should be city council persons and from having been a trained City planner, no city planner in their right mind would make the comprises made in Denver to get re-elected. Sad!"

5361,158578570,Steve Ambrose,‚Ä¢ Lowry,23 Aug,"Thank You, for a thorough update. I agree with your assessment. I am sure the opposition to your assessment will have a name to call those who agree with you. Fear of difference in opinion, looks, religion is actually the basis for the derogatory word that has been slung to warrant support for what is really just not a good way to implement a new permitted zoning use."

I have a puppy who was rescued from being dumped at a Dairy Queen parking lot in a box and looked to be pointer but as he has started to grow he is pit bull. All he does is cuddle. He was failed by humans once and now twice. If you met him and told me you think we should not be here that would be one thing, but you have no idea what the dogs being told they are unwelcome are really like. History has proven it VERY dangerous to have a mind like yours toward other groups."

I was right behind them, and I brought this to the attention of two employees, and the male employee asked them to put them up. Even though the lady was claiming a disability he told her nonetheless,  she had to wear it in the store now. "

If I can find the name of the thrift store I will post it here by tomorrow.

They r required to work when they are released and most don‚Äôt even have clothes to leave with let alone go to thrift stores to buy any. All of the suggestions are good, because I have worked with the homeless as well.  Many have asked society to forgive for their sins, but some are not forgiving at all, but if they want to be forgiven of their sins which everyone has and really realize who the real Judge is then maybe people wouldn‚Äôt be so judgmental about everything especially on ND, seems to be a big problem.

I appreciate and I know they will they know they have done wrong and at a Christmas play they were allowed to do at D U, they asked for forgiveness of sins to society. It was a new program rolled out to inmates as a pilot program  for inmates in Colorado, they did the Christmas Carol, made their own props and everything.

5485,134411698,Sam Allen,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Jan 20,I do believe that we have a homeless problem and the city is trying to alleviate this problem. But do we want to be Portland or San Francisco with tents everywhere? I don't think so. Building 30 tiny houses will not alleviate this problem! I don't want tents in City Park or on our parkways. I hope they can find a job or get mental illness help. A lot of them refuse to go to shelters!

5492,134411698,Jami Horwitz,‚Ä¢ Whittier,18 Jan 20,"A judge found the camping ban unconstitutional.  It's still the law and has not been overturned.  Finding a law unconstitutional  makes the issue become a civil rights issue that will likely be litigated.  Prop 300 didn't pass, so it can't be overturned."
5493,134411698,Scott Gessler,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,22 Jan 20,"It was a county judge. Further, the judge did not issue an injunction stopping the city, but made a decision  based on very narrow facts of one ticket. And even if the judge DID try to issue an injunction, county judges have  no such authority. The city used that one, very  minor decision, as an  excuse to stop enforcement.

It's awful but if anyone knows of this happening, call 311 with address and if you can take video (or picture) it really helps prove they left their animals out in freezing temps. I will say, I reported this with all of the above when someone left their dog out in negative temps a few years ago. The dog was out for about 12hrs and when the Animal Protection Officer arrived they denied it and that was that. And as unfair as it is, apparently if the animal has access to a covered area (in this case an awning) and water (not frozen) it's legal :( Disgusting!"

5574,147635005,Sharron W.,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,10 May 20,First we need to see if what the current re-opening of businesses is working to prevent more people going to the hospitals with the virus. Remember we can't over whelm the hospitals again with a bunch of sick people. Who will care for you or anyone else who gets the virus if the hospitals don't have staff.

I went to the beauty shop today, it was not business as usual, have to say I kinda liked it. It certainly was not as busy which got me out faster, there was social distancing I was talking to my beautician and she had someone in her chair she politely told me i needed to step back 6 ft.

5595,147635005,jonathan d.,‚Ä¢ Sunnyside,10 May 20,It‚Äôs simple math. What is the size of the population? What percentage of those people need to be infected to reach herd immunity? What is the fatality rate of the infection? 
5596,147635005,Rob A.,‚Ä¢ Beeler Park,1y,"Your math is off. Your assuming the medical treatments and ability to handle this virus are not getting better. Sorry buddy.  I don‚Äôt agree at all.  There are no vaccines but there are plenty of treatments that works well above 50% of the time to heal people, some as high as 80% depending on the patient.(edited)"
5597,147635005,Clay S.,‚Ä¢ South Mar Lee/Brentwood,10 May 20,China and the nature of their government have historically lied about this and leadership of our country in the past has reacted accordingly. Trump is obviously not prepared to be a leader and still is not making testing and contact tracing a priority. Trump has a lot of blame to take during this yet he refuses to take any blame. Every president in history says things like the buck stops here but a reality show tv star as a president is quite obviously a recipe for disaster. Makes me want George W to come back even
5598,147635005,Steve C.,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,10 May 20,"Oh, I was with you until the last sentence. That guy failed to heed warnings of likely terrorist attack, lied us into two wars, oversaw the outsourcing of America's largest manufacturers, then stood by during the subprime mortgage crisis -- which has been established as the trigger for the Global Financial Crisis, and the unemployment rate doubled during his administration with the final numbers at 53 consecutive months of job losses ""peaking"" at 800,000 jobs lost in December of 2008."
5599,147635005,Rob A.,‚Ä¢ Beeler Park,10 May 20,jonathan d. No worries. I don‚Äôt agree with your assumptions or death rates. Your facts are your beliefs.  Mine come from differing info. Let‚Äôs not debate such. We won‚Äôt agree.  Rather be a friendly neighbor in the end. Cheers

5609,141813717,Nora Weiker,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Mar 20,I notified Tom. As a reporter maybe he can help. I've lost count of how many pets we have lost. N
5610,141813717,Nora Weiker,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Mar 20,Its been going on for close to two yrs. Some dogs have been found being sold! I dont think this is a pet wanting situation. N
5611,141813717,Nora Weiker,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Mar 20,I hope our neighbors take similar precautions
5612,141813717,Josh Warriner,‚Ä¢ Skyland,24 Mar 20,This is not a really great time. Everyone is on edge. If he keeps it up they'll be scraping his brain off the street.
5613,141813717,Robin Knight,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Mar 20,Yeah a kennel on the back of a bike is pretty obvious That would be odd anywhere
5614,141813717,Nora Weiker,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Mar 20,Oh well!
5615,141813717,Lisa Stapley,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,24 Mar 20,Some are sold or used for dog fighting bait.  I'm not letting my pup outside unsupervised
5616,141813717,Deborah Stough,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Mar 20,They also sell them to labs I have read.
5617,141813717,Nora Weiker,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Mar 20,"Dont let the kennel fool you. They are stealing big dogs as well. Please if you live in the area, check your cameras for a possible sighting. We have a good description thanks to Robin. N"
5618,168232366,Keegan Perkins,‚Ä¢ Central Park,24w,"I used to work at a library, and people would leave items from sack lunches that they didn‚Äôt want. Will you offer the masks, or just put them in the lunches, because I‚Äôm thinking it might just end up being additional waste if they don‚Äôt want them. We had sack bags and applesauce containers all over the library. "
5619,168232366,Tara Willis,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Nov,Happy to just offer them if that‚Äôs best. I offer the sack lunch in general and I suppose if they don‚Äôt want or need the sanitizer or masks I can keep them and given them to the next person. Certainly don‚Äôt want to add more waste. Thanks!

5621,150423539,Becky Robinson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 Jun,Thank you for organizing! I will try to join and will keep an eye out for future demonstrations in the neighborhood if I can‚Äôt get there tonight
5622,150423539,Jake Arias,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,3 Jun,Thank you so much for this!! It's great that parents are providing a safe place to show their support with their children. There have been many unsupervised children downtown causing mayhem during these and sadly this detrimental to the cause. I encourage parents to please be aware of where your children are during these protests. I was working in aid stations all weekend and there were plenty of teenagers trying to seek refuge after damaging police cars or starting fires. These acts only reflect poorly on the organizers that are trying to demonstrate peacefully. Thank you!!
5623,150423539,Alicia Sitzmann,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,3 Jun,Great idea to teach kids a peaceful way to stand up for what is right.

5629,150423539,Helo Wonderful,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,3 Jun,Just saw this. Is it happening tomorrow night too? I just saw a peaceful protest in Austin that turned bad but I hope that in Denver things can be different

5648,137479239,Francine Campone,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,16 Feb 20,Recreative on Santa Fe is a good choice.  The Gathering Place on Colfax & High St. also has a knitting class for their members (women seeking to transition out of homelessness)
5649,137479239,Sharon Hale,‚Ä¢ City Park West,16 Feb 20,"I have a friend in my knitting group that knits with a church group that definitely gives items to the needy. If this is what you're thinking of, i would be happy to take the yarn to her"
5650,137479239,Sharon Hale,‚Ä¢ City Park West,17 Feb 20,It is called Knitting for Peace
5651,137479239,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Feb 20,"Knitting For Peace located at 2600 Leyden Street in the Park Hill UCC Church. They donate items to the homeless, to newborns, etc. It's a wonderful non-profit which creates knit and crocheted blankets, washcloths, hats, scarves, socks, etc."
5652,137479239,Sharon Hale,‚Ä¢ City Park West,17 Feb 20,That's the group that my friend knits for! I couldn't remember the name.
5653,137479239,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Feb 20,Sharon Hale awesome! I love them!

5661,152664188,Dorothy Todd,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Jun,"I'm looking for it for a friend who is doing lots of 3-D printing. I checked with him and he said he didn't know whether Everclear would work or not, but had always used isopropyl alcohol and was certain that it worked. I passed on your suggestion to him."
5662,152664188,Carlos C.,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,24 Jun,"Haven't seen any lately, what kind of printer do you have?"
5663,152664188,Dorothy Todd,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Jun,"Thanks Carlos, I am on the lookout for a friend who is working full time, so I'm helping with the leg-work.  I don't know what type of printer he has. Shipping and supply is weird lately, grocery stores are out of some items that I would never anticipate.  I looked for tapioca (in a box to make at home).  They haven't had it for several weeks!  Tapioca?!?  I don't think there has been a run on it!!! Strange times!"
5664,152664188,Jane Hile,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Jun,What %?
5665,152664188,Jane Hile,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Jun,Dollar tree has rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) at 50%. Most other places like drugstores sell it at 70% and Walmart is the only place I have found that carries 90%.
5666,152664188,Dorothy Todd,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Jun,Thanks! I'll see who has some in stock. And I'll see what % is needed.
5667,152664188,Jane Hile,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,26 Jun,If they need 90% you can order online from Walmart and they'll ship.
5668,152664188,Jeremy Hutt,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,26 Jun,I ordered some 70% on Amazon. Didn't seem to be a problem...
5669,152664188,Norah Lovato,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 Jun,I‚Äôve had good luck finding it at Walgreens
5670,146898852,Terri Vitale,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,3 May 20,They don‚Äôt provide masks for their drivers either
5671,146898852,JB Lewis,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,3 May 20,I believe the UPS stores are independently owned. Try the store in the shopping center on 1st and University. It‚Äôs the same shopping center as Christy Sports.
5672,146898852,Chris Johnson,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,3 May 20,Property owners restricted hallway access so that you can only use one door.  I‚Äôve gone there several times since the start and you are 100% correct masks are not being provided.  
5673,146898852,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 May 20,"FWIW, I usually take any packing air bubbles I get to them for re-use and they are not currently accepting them due to covid fears.  I understand they have a small space but they really need to provide their workers with masks! O.o"
5674,146898852,Amber Lo,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,3 May 20,You should call 311 if you want to effect the enforcement of change
5675,146898852,Nancy Ulrich,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,4 May 20,There is a  shop at Lowry where The owner is very careful but also very helpful. 
5676,146898852,Elizabeth Restat,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,4 May 20,"That UPS store was peculiar before COVID.  I went in there one sunday and there were scented candles burning, the lights were low, and slow jams a la Teddy Pendergrass were playing through the speakers.  I felt like I was intruding, largely because it was generously implied by the people behind the counter that I was.  So I'm unsurprised that they're not complying with COVID / social distancing / etc.  The one on University is doing nicely and as far as I know no one's getting ready to get their groove on during business hours."
5677,146898852,Karen White,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,4 May 20,I was just at UPS at 700 Colorado Blv (10:30 am Monday 4th).  They are limiting access to 3 people at a time in the store - they have 3 stations so that means there is no waiting in line IN the store.  They have floor marked 6' apart between each station as well as from the station counter.  All employees are wearing masks.
5678,146898852,Maria Garcia Berry,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,4 May 20,"I agree. I was there last Thursday and i had to wait my turn outside on an X, and staff were wearing masks and we had to stand on the X as they were helping us."
5679,146898852,Matt Todaro,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,4 May 20,"I concur, and customer flow is one way, in though the front door and out the back.  I was just there at 12pm today and felt very comfortable with what they were doing.  Maybe this post worked?"
5680,146898852,Michael MacLauchlan,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,1y,On a related note I was on a Saturday walk at City Park and noticed multiple groups of people without masks. Also the Porta-Potty was open and used by three consecutive people (including a pregnant woman) within minutes. I often wonder about the surfaces...
5681,146898852,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,4 May 20,"The porta potties really need to stay open, as people still need to pee, especially homeless folks who have even fewer places to go nowadays since so many places are closed.  And pregnant ladies need to pee *often*. ;)  However I'd hope that they put in a handwashing station along with it - porta potty companies offer those, but they're not often actually used.  Maybe call P&R and ask them to include handwashing stations if you didn't see one."
5682,146898852,Tas Frashure,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 May 20,The UPS Store next to Home Depot off Quebec was practicing safe measures with masks and distancing. Try that one instead.
5683,146898852,Victor Ament,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,4 May 20,There are hand washing stations by the portapotties in Cheesman Park.
5684,146898852,Gwen Ross,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,4 May 20,"I went there today. Yes, not the most organized or cleanest, but they put my package together.....gave me a receipt and I was out the door before I knew what was happening. Quick and efficient. "
5685,146898852,Kelly Keesee,‚Ä¢ Hale,4 May 20,"How about just not going someplace you aren‚Äôt comfortable with rather than trashing them. If it doesn‚Äôt feel good to you, simply go elsewhere. They don‚Äôt owe you anything other than the their service. I have always had great service there."
5686,146898852,Christine Keitlen,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,5 May 20,"I was at this UPS store on Sunday (next door to Snooze). They have a 3-customer maximum inside and mask requirements, even the clerks were wearing masks. Then outside, everyone was standing 6' apart in line to get in. This was my experience."
5687,146898852,Cat S.,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,1y,This will become less of an issue tomorrow: https://www.denverpost.com/2020/05/01/denver-hancock-coronavirus-face-masks/(edited)
5688,146898852,Heidi Schneeveis,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 May 20,"I go in there a lot, and the floor is marked with tape for social distancing 6 feet. :)"
5689,146898852,Peter Meinig,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 May 20,"Yeah, the problem isn't the store, it's the people not practicing proper social distancing.  If you are concerned about your proximity to other people, there are plenty of ship from home / scheduled pick-up options available.  I have been in that store, and they are making very reasonable efforts to comply with the recommendations."
5690,146898852,Lesley Millhouser,‚Ä¢ City Park,6 May 20,"I've been there several times since the quarantine began (needed a notary and to ship stuff).  I found the staff to be diligent about maintaining social distancing.  The bigger problem is they are getting slammed with customers and are not always able to stop customers before they get in (however, I have seen them send people back outside).  I'm sorry that you had a bad experience when you went, but I felt like I should let you know I have have the opposite experience."
5691,146898852,Sandra Moore,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,6 May 20,"Oh great, I have to go tomorrow to return an Amazon purchase.  My daughter works at a UPS Store in another state.  They are provided masks, shields and gloves."
5692,149414288,Joe Flynn,‚Ä¢ City Park West,26 May,Dreading the day one shows up on my street üò≠ I‚Äôve definitely seen an increase on my local bike rides
5693,149414288,Andrea O'Brien,‚Ä¢ City Park,26 May,Have you tried reporting the issues to the district attorney‚Äôs office?
5694,149414288,Erin Williams,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 May,He JUST parked in front of our house this AM and now his engine is smoking. We were planning to call 311 after 72 hours.
5695,149414288,Chad Cox,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 May,I called 311 last week and all the normal ways of reporting ended in ‚Äúno service‚Äù.
5696,149414288,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,26 May,I guess I don't understand what's happening - are they parking there and then not moving for months?
5697,149414288,Chad Cox,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 May,Not for months in one place.  Maybe a week in one place then move down the block and stay another week.  This continues because the city won‚Äôt enforce the parking laws.  I had one of them come into my yard and plug their motorhome into my outdoor electrical outlet.
5698,149414288,Stephanie Bean,‚Ä¢ City Park,26 May,"I had an abandoned Jeep in front of my house for a few weeks several years ago.  I mentioned it to the parking ticket people when they were going around for street sweeping, it was gone within 2 hours.  Sometimes a casual conversation with the ticket issuers speed things along..."
5699,149414288,Chad Cox,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 May,"I just looked up the street sweeping schedule on the Denver site and they are no longer ticketing and towing, which is the root cause of all this.  It‚Äôs going to get really bad this summer with no enforcement."
5700,149414288,Nancy Bell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,50w,"It could be worse...tons of Curtis Park neighbors are objecting to this in front of their homes, long before the Covid 19 virus.(edited)"
5701,149414288,Chad Cox,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 May,"I hear you, but I certainly am not posting this so we can all just get comfortable with it."
5702,149414288,Amy Pieper,‚Ä¢ Hale,49w,"Maybe it's someone that lost thier home because of all of this. Maybe someone was lucky enough to keep thier job, but have lost thier housing. "
5703,149414288,Brandee Sky,‚Ä¢ City Park West,49w,"That's a really thoughtful point, Amy. I appreciate you for adding to the conversation. I've never been homeless but I think of things like what you presented fairly often as I see these camps around town. The guy who posted said he did originally communicate directly. I agree, person to person comm, if done safely, is totally useful for initial & respectful contact but beyond that, I'd call the city too...they're strangers on his property stealing electricity. Still, certainly feel sad for folks doing such things to survive because no one wants to live that way but that's what comes of a country suffering from severe wealth inequality.(edited)"
5704,149414288,Chad Cox,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,26 May,"And the Moho keeps moving around our block, isn‚Äôt registered, parking illegally, and connecting power to peoples property while every day there are reports of break ins and stolen bikes.  I have lots of empathy but doing this is not ok."
5705,149414288,Amy Pieper,‚Ä¢ Hale,28 May,"Chad, it's unfair to assume this motor home person is the culprit in the break ins"" and stolen bikes. That is, unless you saw it happen. "
5706,149414288,Tim R.,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 May,All parking enforcement laws are suspended in the city till may 31.  That includes 72 hr abandoned vehicle towing and 24 hour 22' or longer rig towing.

Let the tomatoes dry between watering, fertilize the soil well with compost, bone meal, calcium and garden lime (to prevent blossom rot), and feed the plant once every two weeks with a high nitrogen based plant food. YouTube has tons of videos on how to prune them for best result. Water them without getting the leaves wet to prevent mildew.

And are ridiculously hard to get rid of.  Turns out they were not the right kind of hops for beer.  Who‚Äôknew?

They grow so good I've had to pick daily they are so sweet & juicy. If you can't eat all at once rinse off dry and put in a Ziploc bag and freeze. You can use for salsa stew spaghetti sauce etc....

5737,136311197,Shelby G.,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park,7 Feb 20,Thanks for sharing! I found this article extremely informative. I don't see a problem with allowing more unrelated people to live together. Better than living on the streets. Y'all must really hate poor people if you're opposed to this.
5738,136311197,Mary Ellen Silcott,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,7 Feb 20,No one has said they hate poor people.  Let's please discuss this issue without being snarky.

5741,136311197,Christopher P.,‚Ä¢ Harvey Park,7 Feb 20,They don't enforce these laws now!   The only thing this  will do is promote more people living in single family residences and allowing even more cars to a house. There is a house not far from me that I literally counted 11 vehicles parked in front of it.  On what used to be the lawn etc...   This is ridiculous and the powers that are suggesting this is a good idea are also ridiculous...  It is not an either or scenario for those who say better than people living on the streets.  Most of those people are not on teh streets because of these rules!
5742,136311197,Rex M.,‚Ä¢ Fort Logan,7 Feb 20,I believe allowing people to solve their own problems with them cooperating is the best option and interfering with it should not be done.
5743,136311197,Beth B.,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,7 Feb 20,"I agree for the most part, except mental illness, addiction (self medicating), handicaps, domestic abuse (not always just physical) have to be accounted for. Sone people are not capable mentally to get it together others need that little boost or resources. Some need to feel someone cares for motivation. Some are plain embarrassed. People need people. But also people need to take responsibility. Compassion and common sense are two great abilities. The world is not and will never be black and white. Embrace & learn to love the complexity of the gray area inbetween. Not pointing fingers at you just making a statement."
5744,136311197,Cindy E.,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park East,1y,Preliminary information from a community HOA meeting is that the recommendation will be up to 8 unrelated people per 1600 square foot property and for each additional 200 square feet 1 unrelated person is allowed.  Seems like a lot of cars...and potential people - each one can have related people in the home too?  So a 2000 square foot home can have up to 10 unrelated people.  Not saying that this shouldn't be looked at just make it reasonable and then enforce it.(edited)

The house next to me is already falling apart as a rental.... I'm sure the landlord would take full advantage of this.
5749,136311197,Diane D.,‚Ä¢ Marston,7 Feb 20,I have reviewed the information for this proposal and can find nothing in it to benefit the citizens of Denver. Aside from the obvious parking issues which could potentially be 16 more vehicles parked on the streets. All this does is allow non Denver residents that own property in Denver to get more in rent and create ghettos. Please contact your Councilperson and let them know you oppose this ordinance change.
5750,136311197,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,7 Feb 20,This goes WAY beyond parking.

5753,136311197,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,7 Feb 20,"i have been following this issue closely for months; restrictions on unrelated cohabitants are just one aspect out of several to the group living amendment; before jumping to conclusions, i suggest reading through the page linked in the OP ‚Äî it will help you understand the reasoning and be more realistic about the impacts"
5754,136311197,Dorothy N.,‚Ä¢ Baker,18 Feb 20,"‚ÄúWe are modernizing a very outdated code with an eye toward equity,‚Äù said Andrew Webb, the city planner who has managed the project on zoning for group living. ‚ÄúWe certainly think it‚Äôs very important to bring the code up to speed with the way people living together has evolved.‚Äù"
5755,136311197,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,7 Feb 20,"That‚Äôs my concern. How it reads right now is one thing. How it works, is monitored and controlled in a wide spectrum of potential applications  is  my concern. None of this is addressed."
5756,136311197,Debra Buchanan,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,25 Feb 20,Or leave troubled neighbors with no way to resolve violations.
5757,136311197,Priscilla T.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,7 Feb 20,Why more housing we got enough people here. Why not invest your little project into something more useful like trying to save our planet or like preserve land and sanctuaries. Climate change does exist people. Our environment is on the bridge of dying.
5758,136311197,Randy K.,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NW,7 Feb 20,"You're comparing apples to oranges!  Of course the environment matters, but if you think affordable housing is not important, take a look outside your window today and try to imagine that it's you that has to sleep outside in this storm!"
5759,136311197,Gayle Gar,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,7 Feb 20,"If it's similar to Section 8 Housing rules & regs, what will the maximum number of occupant limits be in one residence?  Who will be responsible for overseeing the maximum number doesn't end up being more that number + 2, 3, 4, 5, or more?  We know of two Section 8 housing locations where the occupants are supposed to be a woman and her children. Grandma, great grandmoms, boyfriend and a host of others bunk under the same roof.  New s never watered (replaced a multitude of times), window coverings trashed, broken windows, dog excrement all over, and the insides look squalid.  Just saying.  A residence like this could be your next door neighbor."
5760,136311197,Joyce R.,‚Ä¢ University Park,18 Feb 20,So true. There are homes rented to groups of students around DU and they are always a mess.
5761,136311197,Ken Strohson,‚Ä¢ Whittier,7 Feb 20,"Steve H Please read what definition of Gerrymandering is. Hint it is a political term Not a zoning term. I believe in capitalism and made $ building moderate and low income housing in Denver for 20 years. The current free market in real estate and higher end houseing market left to its own has contributed to many but not all of the problems. The United States has not had a completely free market in over 150 years. Read the history of the Erie Canal which could never have been built without government subsidies. That Canal provide a major boost in the economy during that period while the country was in a recession with grain and other agricultural products flowing to Eastern cities and industrial products going west. Many of the railroads the same and in particular the East West Continental Railroads were highly lsubsidized. I completely agree that these efforts are a drop in the proverbial bucket for very low income and homeless which is a far more complex problem that housing. Where would young teachers, restaurant and grocery workers, other service and factory and warehouse workers live in the future. Answer will be building further East, North into prime farmland for example Weld County. Weld  is the largest producer and of Agricultural products in Colorado and more than any in the West until the large Agricultural Valleys in Southern California. South also to Colorado Springs. This is highly iinefficiencty spreading out chewing up more land and resources. Maybe you have your little slice of heaven. I do but I am 71 and I care about my kids and grandchildren in Denver where my daughter who has a College degree and her husband a Community College Business degree. They struggle living in a two bedroom apartment with kids. They will move in with me and I will move into my basement until I build my garage and 700 square ft living space. I care about how my grandchildren and there working class peers are educated etc. I have a law degree and a. Master's degree. Athletic ability paid for most of my education and growing up in two schools systems one ranked #2 in New York State and the other somewhere in the top 8 in Illinois."

5763,136311197,Kristi Valdez,‚Ä¢ Cole,7 Feb 20,I‚Äôm assuming this new revised plan will not be implemented in single family neighborhoods but pushed into the new gentrified neighborhoods where a large part of the homes were bought to flip rather than live in and now these landlords are more than willing to let as many strangers they can get into their houses to make a profit. If these houses are not YOUR neighbors than it sounds like a great idea. I‚Äôm speaking as a home owner who has already went through this... It will never end well!
5764,136311197,Gaar Potter,‚Ä¢ Happy Canyon,7 Feb 20,"Um Kristi, this new revised plan is aimed EXACTLY at single family neighborhoods and their zoning. Next time you vote, find out who hearts this and don't vote for them.  That might include your present rep.....we'll see. So your assumption is wrong."

Why didn't someone at least get a plate/tag number so others may go in search of this vehicle, or contact the non-emergency number for the police?

5836,170706186,Shannon Haines,‚Ä¢ Skyland,13 Dec,"Thank you for mentioning this Mimi. I am relying on Instacart also for my only income and I'm grateful for the work and tips. People do need to know it's hard work, and there are expenses for us too (vehicle expenses, gas, maintenance). Consider the following when tipping also.. are you in an apartment building where there is limited parking and we will have to bring your groceries up an elevator and down a long hallway? That's more time and physically can be challenging. I just hope people recognize that or offer to meet at the door to assist if your not going to tip or don't have it to tip. It really is a premium service to have people grocery shop for you and deliver it. If the industry standard for serving in restaurants is 20% shouldn't shopping and delivery services be in that ballpark? Instacart default on the tip used to be 5%. I don't know if it's changed. I think it's a good thing to tip according to the service also. If your shopper provides better level of service or on the flip side is rude unresponsive takes too long delivering take those factors into consideration also. "

5840,170706186,Sandra S.,‚Ä¢ Aurora,14 Dec,I do tip Instacart drivers.  But what about when you open your bags and items are missing?  I know they find those items in their car. Why not bring us our items. Happened several times to me.
5841,170706186,Amanda Mitchell,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,17 Dec,Once the delivery is completed they can no longer contact you or see your address.

5844,170706186,Shannon Haines,‚Ä¢ Skyland,15 Dec,"That is not acceptable. You pay for usable groceries. When something like this happens, and unfortunately it does.. sometimes we drop things or inadvertently something gets crushed. If I know about it, I will let the customer know and suggest they contact Instacart to request a refund of any damaged items. Hopefully that‚Äôs what u did. If they dropped the stuff at the door damaged and didn‚Äôt tell you about it- because how would u not know about a wet bag of eggs :) maybe mention that. It‚Äôs good feedback for us also to know about your experience too! Thanks."
5845,170706186,TL H.,‚Ä¢ Aurora,15 Dec,"Thanks for posting. I'm having everything delivered right now. I had groceries delivered from Walmart the other day by a young woman that worked for Door Dash. I felt bad because I had a couple heavy items delivered. I wish I would have noticed she was bringing stuff to the door right away, I have a wagon that folds up that I use to carry stuff from my vehicle to the house back when I could shop. I would have let her use it to. When I mentioned it she said she would like to get one herself. She told me about the small amount she gets paid by Door Dash and how a lot of people don't tip. She said she did an order the day before mine and had to carry 4-24 packs of soda up to the 3rd floor of a building and she didn't get any tip on that order. "
5846,170706186,Nancy Sloane,‚Ä¢ Lowry,15 Dec,"I'm glad you brought up this topic. I've never been sure what to do when my groceries are delivered. I went ahead and tipped, anyway, wondering if I'd already ""tipped"" the person by way of charges tacked on to my order. I'm so appreciative of anyone who helps me out, especially since I'm stuck at home with this quarantine! I've always been a good tipper, but now, realizing how little you're paid, I'll pay extra attention to what I give to my shopper/delivery person."
5847,170706186,Norah Lovato,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,21w,"I am so sorry Mimi.  This is terrible. These folks are driving to/from the grocery store, shopping for you in a pandemic & delivering the food to your front door after possibly carrying your groceries down the street & up flights of stairs and people don‚Äôt tip??? "
5848,170706186,Shannon Haines,‚Ä¢ Skyland,15 Dec,"Well said. Perhaps a softer approach to convey the message, üòã but I‚Äôm learning and liking how direct people seem to be in Colorado. You are right tho."

5851,170706186,Rachel Makinen,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Dec,"It's really sad that the delivery companies are so cheap and treating their employees like crap. Yes it's imperative to tip, but a good business should be paying their employees a sustainable wage, even if they are part-time or contract workers. These delivery companies are making a fortune right now and it's disgusting that they're paying the employees so poorly. I always over tip and those who can afford to do so, should.  But also please keep in mind that some people don't have other options and they are also perhaps in a compromise position and/or strapped for cash because of covid;  perhaps they are out of work,b lost their car or jobs or are in poor health, etc."
5852,170706186,Charlene/Joseph Medina,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,16 Dec,Instacart calculates a delivery charge plus tips and another charge equal to tip charge! I find that that is all I can afford most times! I have started picking up my groceries after ordering online and I believe in tipping but find myself without cash for a tip! I will try to add some extra to the tip when I use Instacart!
5853,170706186,Ann Burke,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Dec,"Mimi Kyles, start your own business on the side! We will support you!"

My twelve year old got on a Ouiji board kick just a couple weeks ago (a classmate had brought one to school and they had a riot playing with it).  So, she and I went on a mission to buy one, but all the Targets, Wizards Chest, etc., were sold out.  We had to find one on Amazon.  Anyways, after all that effort she got it and has played with it for like twenty minutes.  Definitely proved to be more fun with a crowd, than with just a couple kids.  I‚Äôll check with her this evening if she‚Äôd mind sharing with a neighbor for a little while."

I'm not a very superstitious person but someone very close to me used to pull out her ouija board every night and something very unpleasant happened to her. There's a chance there is zero connection between the bad event and the ouija board  and I'm being foolish but I ""reasoned"" from effect to cause and never went near one again.

5888,135107716,Sharron W.,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,1y,"I feel that if more parents spent time with their children, and parent their kids then most kids would not be committing the crimes, or be the victim of the crime. Why, because they'd be at home with their family rather than running the streets. Most parents don't know where their kids are at 90% of the time, they don't know the kid's name or anything about the parents or the environment in which they are going. Sometimes society needs to step back and do things the old  school way. My mother would never let us out the door without telling her where we were going, what time we'd be home before 10 pm, and then who are the parents. Later, mom would go over and introduce herself to the other parents if she saw a friend ship developing. Parents need to get more involved in their kids rather than the cell phone. Yeah, I said this! You go into stores or places and the kids yelling to the mother and she's so busy on the phone she can't stop to pay attention to the child. Yeah, I;m calling you out!!!!!(edited)"

Where did u see an activist speak on the matter everyone is saddened by the violence, but there r matters that need to be done, it is not one simple solution. What do u mean Diane, he is from there? From where? Most of u have never ever dealt with these sort of issues so don‚Äôt be so fast to judge as to what needs to be done and how. Years ago I had a friend her son was killed in front of their house, never found out who killed him, if it could be solved so easily don‚Äôt u think it would be solved by now so it would not be anymore teen deaths. I feel empathy and much sadness, for those that has lost their child I can‚Äôt imagine having to loose my child, in fact the mayor has teenagers too.

5921,141292402,Donna K.,‚Ä¢ Platt Park,14 Aug,The negative implications are the same regardless if the article was written in March 2020

5926,151955996,LInda Poletti,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"Honestly I can see HD dilemma!  I've seen some people react very negatively  when an innocent employee who is covering the front door to an establishment stops them about masks.  It's a tough situation.  An employee shouldn't have to be at risk by enforcing the wearing of masks!  I was at HD recently (wearing a mask) and I feel like I saw a box of masks by customer service (I could be wrong) and maybe they should at the very least have the box by the front door and 'offer' a mask to anyone who enters if they don't have one.  this might help a bit but again, if someone is refusing, it's certainly not the responsibility of any of the employees to put themselves at risk to enforce this.  I really feel for these retail establishments and dealing with people who just refuse to think about others."
5927,151955996,Shari Wilkins-Duley,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,17 Jun,I‚Äôve seen ACE have someone stand at the door and turn customers away if they didn‚Äôt have a mask on.
5928,151955996,Kate Killin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,17 Jun,"The refusal to wear a mask makes no sense to me. But yes, I have been going to Ace on the Fax which is incredible and I feel so safe going there.  Plus Ace on the Fax is a franchise owned by a local woman whereas HD is a corporation so I'd rather my money go to Ace."
5929,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"Good to know this. I will definitely avoid HD because I don't want to go anywhere where there is threat of violence since I think that is a very selfish and ""primitive"" way of expressing oneself. I'd rather support a woman-owned business anyway and avoid as much obnoxious behavior as I can."
5930,151955996,Erik Flick,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,I too have been avoiding HD and giving all my business to ACE because of their policies. Please error on the side of caution.
5931,151955996,Tayo McGuirk,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"No shoes, no shirt, no service! No mask, no service! It's a public health issue."
5932,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"I've heard that some men refuse to wear a mask because they think it makes them look ""weak"". So only having concern for their own vanity and no concern for the well-being of others is supposed to make them look ""strong""? To me it just makes them look ignorant, pigheaded and selfish, not being qualities that I associate with strength."
5933,151955996,Rox Kunz,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,17 Jun,hmm I wonder where they got those ideas from...‚Äùour‚Äù dear leaderü§®
5934,151955996,Patricia Monheit,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,The True Value on Colfax is also locally owned and customers there seem very mask compliant.

5936,151955996,Dorota O'Neill,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"Disappointing about HD... a few weeks ago they were good about enforcing masks, and turning away customers who weren't wearing them. I guess that's changed now. Will be shopping at True Value then."
5937,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"Dorota, enforcing is one thing, doing battle with some a-hole who gets violent about it is another whole can of worms. I don't blame anybody for not wanting to get into fisticuffs with someone too selfish and primitive to want to put on a mask."

5939,151955996,Shawna Murphy,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,It‚Äôs the same at Lowe‚Äôs and Walmart. When I asked employees about it I was told management instructed them not to enforce the mask law.
5940,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"There's a big difference between a store policy to require/ask for masks on customers and one that doesn't bother. I can well understand not wanting to do battle with someone who turns savage about a small request like ""please wear a mask in the store"" but to places that don't even bother trying to get customers to comply, I'd rather avoid them because the more people who wear masks the safer we all will be. Personally, for someone who's been following the stay-at-home orders since mid-March hoping to avoid a re-spiking in illness in Denver, I would prefer keeping myself safe and others as well, since their health impacts mine and the entire community. Being locked in at home is getting a little old. . ."
5941,151955996,Joanne Spillman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"Never shop at Home Depot, anyway; would rather go to True Value on Colfax."
5942,151955996,Laura Waligorski,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"I‚Äôve avoided HD for years. Ace on the Fax hires very helpful employees and, oh - they‚Äôre trying to keep us safe. No brainer for me."
5943,151955996,Rick and Cathy Reynolds,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,Retailers will require masks and distancing when 100% of their customers are mask-less and are boycotted by the 75% of cautious customers.
5944,151955996,Betty Miller,‚Ä¢ Central Park,46w,"I witnessed 2 customers verbally assaulting the poor gentleman at the door who was enforcing the mask rule and threatening to ""kick his ass"" when I went shortly after it first reopened.  Something similar happened again the last time I was there."
5945,151955996,Olga Guerra,‚Ä¢ Hale,17 Jun,They could and should call the police!
5946,151955996,LInda Poletti,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Jun,Completely agree with you Betty Miller!  It's a very slippery slope for employees who are really at risk trying to enforce this.
5947,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"Personally, I wish the governor would make mask-wearing manditory, but then those who only think to frame it as a ""freedom"" issue would go ballistic and likely become more belligerent than they are already. "
5948,151955996,Patricia Monheit,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,I think in Denver they are mandatory.
5949,151955996,Andrew Sweet,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,Thank you all for weighing in.  I think the boycott idea is most appropriate.  Patronize those places that respect ALL people‚Äôs safety.
5950,151955996,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,17 Jun,I do t think it‚Äôs fair to blame HD. I still go there - I just give the jerks a wide berth.
5951,151955996,Justin Hersom,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"Last time I was at hd on Quebec it was basically impossible to give anyone a wide berth, especially the people who believe the whole thing is made up and are not concerned with giving space"
5952,151955996,Sheryl Olson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"If smaller ACE and True Value can provide staff to comply with our regs, why can't big box HD.  I concur with Andrew S."
5953,151955996,Betty Miller,‚Ä¢ Central Park,46w,"This is obviously anecdotal, but it seems that more conscientious, less pig-headed and aggressive people are shopping at the smaller stores.  So, maybe it's an easier task. "
5954,151955996,Margaret Baldwin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"City of Denver has advised businesses to call 311 to report customers who  refuse to wear masks and not to serve them. No shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service."
5955,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"While refusing to serve the mask-less seems like a good solution, I wouldn't want to be the cashier who refuses service to someone who's going to go ape-sh!t over being asked to wear a mask in the first place. I can imagine that person throwing hammers or whatever they are trying to buy because they can't get service because they won't wear a mask. That will prove how ""strong"" they are. I also don't expect they will wait around for 311 to send someone to deal with them, either."
5956,151955996,Stefanie Bell,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,The Glendale  HD was good last week.
5957,151955996,Margaret Baldwin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,311 should be called when they enter the store per City of Denver guidelines. Of course no one should try to physically stop a maskless customer. Nothing in any store is worth risking injury or worse.

5959,151955996,William Jones,‚Ä¢ Skyland,17 Jun,"Customers can call 311 as well.  A while ago, the Bass Pro Shop at Northfield had about 50% compliance.  They said an inspector would visit the store."
5960,151955996,Zak Bugaj,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,17 Jun,"People here in Denver have been shot over a mask argument. I like Ace on the fax, and Lowe's in Aurora. They do a good job of spreading people out and both have a giant hand sanitizer when you first walk in To sanitize upon entering and leaving. Sometimes I have to go to home depot I just wear my mask avoid people get my stuff and go. They are trying but they missed the timeframe as far as requiring masks at the door to enter. Since they made it this far it would be hell to change now."
5961,151955996,Andrew Sweet,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,Think they could change but it‚Äôs too expensive to do so.  Perhaps stock holders will raise the issue if business goes down
5962,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"Some people will never wear masks. They don't understand the reasons for doing it and don't accept the science. They think they know better so they will do whatever they want, no matter what."
5963,136839630,Tree Wallace,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,11 Feb 20,"Thanks for what u do!  Don‚Äôt know this cat as I‚Äôm further East - but it doesn‚Äôt look like he has a ‚Äòtipped ear‚Äô so not sure if he is fixed.  Being a male u can generally tell if u can get a good look from behind - can u tell if he has a full scrotum?  If so, I‚Äôd b happy to trap him to get him fixed (or can lend u a trap).  DDFL fixes all cats for free!  It will keep him from impregnating every female in the neighborhood PLUS it keeps him from getting in cat fights - very common amongst the males! I‚Äôve done TNR for years & it is the males that r in the worst shape - with pus pouring out of their ears, or full blown abscesses, cuts & scratches.  When they r not fixed they declare their territory & fight to protect it!  So let me know if u need him fixed! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

5965,136839630,Tree Wallace,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,11 Feb 20,"Oh good, I couldn‚Äôt tell!  It is so hard on them in this cold weather - another thought is if he is a sweetie & u want to bring him in - is to trap him, carry him in & keep him contained in a room where he can‚Äôt hide from u - so like a bathroom & u start by feeding him soft/canned food from a spoon.  Then he associates u with food.  After awhile u may b able to pet him.  U can start by using the handle of a wooden spoon! Maybe stroke him as u feed him?  Then eventually he can have free rein in the house.  He may not ever b an ‚Äòaffectionate‚Äô cat but may be safer & warmer inside for the winter.  Then come spring u can let him come & go - so he has freedom but know u r his food source!  ???"
5966,136839630,Gina Cuomo,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,11 Feb 20,"He seems to be doing pretty alright with the shelter we built - it has an electric blanket. haha But its the times we don't see him for 3-4 days, like this past week. Its been so cold that I hope he's with someome else as crazy as us. Ha"

5969,136839630,Bev Laughlin,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,12 Feb 20,My neighbor and I were feeding a stray for 3 yrs.  He would come the same time everyday to eat. Could never get close to him.  He stayed  in the parkway in the bushes when it was very cold.  We put dry food out in case we would miss him and wet food in the evening.  Then he disappeared.  As long as you keep food out he will keep coming back.  Thanks for taking care of him!!!
5970,136839630,Doreen Rp,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,12 Feb 20,Water is hard to find for animals in this city and so important.  My mom is in the country and a neighbors dog & cats come in all weather for a drink in cattle tank.

We fed him for over five years and let him into our home and garage. He loved our cat, but would not let us too near him. One summer he disappeared for good. We gave him some good years and so did someone else when he‚Äôd leave for weeks at a time. I always hoped someone was able to take him in."
5973,136839630,Carol Brown,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,12 Feb 20,"I have lived in Park Hill for many many years.  I have always had dogs & cats.  long ago I had cats that were indoor/outdoor, but I lost a couple that I loved, & more recently decided that I would no longer let my cats out at all.  I have a cat that a grandson gave me who had been a street cat (young).  I got him fixed, put him in the house with the others, & did not let him out. He tried for awile to get out, I stopped him or went out & caught him & brought him back in. He has adjusted & doesn't try any more.  my dogs spend time in the back yard which they cannot get out of,  I do sympathize with all of you who seem to have fairly frequent escapees, but you can control it....."

5975,136839630,Tree Wallace,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,12 Feb 20,"yes, awhile back i was trying to trap a neighbor's cat who escaped when paramedics arrived when she had a stoke.  i did trap a cat but it wasn't her's.  i knew he wasn't totally feral so he lived in my BR for a month.  i had taken him to my vet (montclair) and was told he didn't have a chip.  i tried my best to get him tamer but after a month i wan't making much progress. he was letting me pet him but not enjoying it.  & never would come to me.   i brought him to the cat care society so he'd not be caged.  within 2 hours he was with his original owners!!!! turns out he had a chip!!!  i informed my vet that their chip reader wasn't working or their technique????  anyway, the owner said he was a feral they were using as a 'barn' type cat gotten from DDFL as a barn cat.  it was never friendly. he lived outdoors. they 'lost' him a year ago.  so, after all that time 'away' and then a month with my almost constant attention, he ended up being their house cat!!!  that's why i recommended they give him a try indoors - cause as sweet as he is, there is hope! gina, is there any chance you'd bring him in, if jane or i help?"
5976,136839630,Arlyn LaBair,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,12 Feb 20,I have a cat that was a barn cat for her first 6 months and decided a while back to go back to living on the street. I hope that someone is taking as good of care as you.  I have a chip checker if you do catch him.

5979,136839630,Martha Pearse,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Feb 20,"That grey cat looks exactly like the one I've been feeding since early January. Big Kitty! I feed on the front porch at sundown--the cat is quite punctual. And, have made a comfy space in the garage with heat and everything except a mint on the pillow. So far, only the food seems to be used. Now, after one previously failed attempt, I got him/her trapped last night and soon we are on our way to Feline Fix.  I hope to find a chip.  If not, well,I'll figure that out when I have to. Much as I'd love to have another cat, the resident two cats and two dogs seem to think otherwise."

5981,136839630,Marty Johnson,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,13 Feb 20,"I have a gray feral male (Borris) and his aunt (Natasha) who have been in my care for over 10 years.  I have fed them both since she was a year old and Borris was born next to my garage.  They were both spayed and neutered a long time ago and now have a heated house on the porch.  I feed them twice a day and they get fresh water as well.  Yes, me and my husband are cat people and no regrets.  A long time ago there were a number of gray cats that were born in Park Hill and at that time we were taking care of four kittens and Natasha.  Natasha is a short haired gray and white and her sister, who is Borris' mother was a long haired gray.  Borris does have a sister who is also a long haired gray.  I believe Borris' mother is dead now and oddly enough his sister did show up on the porch about two years ago and both Borris and Natasha treated her as if she was family.  It was a nice little reunion but unfortunately that was the last time I saw her. The cat in this picture looks a lot like my cat Borris but it can't be him since he doesn't leave the area very much and since he's coming down with arthritis, I doubt it since he does limp.  We live on MLK Blvd & Clermont."

5984,136839630,Martha Pearse,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Feb 20,"Hmm. Thought I posted last night but don't see it. So, here's an update in case I messed up the posting.  Trapped the big grey cat (really a Russian Blue). Feline Fix was helpful but was backed up, so I took him (I think he's a him) to DDFL with  hopes that Azul (yes, I named him. Couldn't stop myself) is a little bit tame and they might be able to put him into their socialization program. The woman at Feline Fix spent quite a bit of time with us, and tried a few moves that make me believe he has at least rudimentary socialization. Can't believe I got so attached.  I was so happy that I trapped him the night before, and that he spent the night in his covered cage in a nice warm hallway...I couldn't sleep. I felt like I'd just given birth."

You are the one working hard!  Say...this boy seems to have real potential. Seems I have a talent for that (tho it's not always a good trait), and you might check DDFL after a bit to see if he's socialized and looking for a mom like you.

6013,151683099,Katie Rude,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,14 Jun,Grew up in Bethesda and I have picky tastes when it comes to seafood (particularly oysters). by far the best seafood I‚Äôve had in Denver is Fish & Beer. Only place out here that can properly shuck an oyster and all their food is amazing. It‚Äôs a restaurant that you could easily see being really successful in Georgetown or on U Street. 
6014,151683099,Anda S.,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,JAX is our favorite seafood place

6021,151683099,Ralph Wechsler,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Jun,I am from Maryland and I haven‚Äôt found anything crab cake-wise that holds up to Faidley‚Äôs in Baltimore. There are several places that ship or you can bring back crab cakes on dry ice. Oysters are decent at the places mentioned. I was liking Mario‚Äôs Ocean Club on Broadway but they went under. 
6022,151683099,SK Kim,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Jun,My friend lives in the Baltimore suburbs - we would always get pappas crabcakes.  Those were huge and delicious

6071,134023917,Erin Walsh,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,9 Jan 20,I heard they implemented the paid parking because construction workers were using there parking lots and they wanted to put an end to that?  Not sure if that‚Äôs true?  I do think we need to support the shopping mall.  I can walk there so I don‚Äôt have to worry about paying for parking though.
6072,134023917,Susan Miesen,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,9 Jan 20,"Just doesn't bother me..... there are to many big things in life to worry about other than parking. For anybody that doesn't agree with the fee, we certainly have a great alternative to drive to Park Meadows and shop. Great shops down there too.  Lots of alternatives...."
6073,134023917,Bruce Madison,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Jan 20,I‚Äôm told that the paid parking brings in $4 million per year to the mall owners. The individual shops are not happy either.
6074,134023917,Catrin Novak,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,9 Jan 20,"My understanding is that there are several reasons for charging at the CC mall, including people parking there and taking the bus or biking downtown as well as people living in condos nearby without sufficient parking would park at the mall leaving less spots available for people shopping there.  It doesn't make sense that they will no longer offer 1 hour free"

In my opinion, it meets the needs you mentioned above. The age of the congregation probably skews more towards older but I think there are more younger people recently than in the past so this may be shifting."

Services are 8;30 AM in the chapel ( upper level of the south building)  and In the main sanctuary at 10:30.   Sunday School classes are in the South building and  there is also an adult forum there with a variety of speakers/ discussion topics, etc.  A coffee/fellowship time is between services in the lower level of the main building , 10;00 to 10:30.  Next Sunday ( I believe) the youth will be painting bowls which will then be fired and sold the following Sunday as a-fundraiser for next summer( I.e., a trip to work with children in Central America). I hope you will come soon.  There is a website.  I hope to see you there, introduce yourself. Marianne Woodward"

It is all inclusive non-denominational congregation and has a children's church. I would also include the Center for Spiritual Living Denver, which meets Sundays at 10am at 789 Sherman in the Colorado Non-profit building. It is a sister church to Mile Hi church in Lakewood.  csldenver.org is the website. We unfortunately are not big enough for a children's ministry."

Beautiful music (traditional) lots of kids, many different activities and a mission to help the homeless. It may look Roman Catholic when you walk in but pretty much opposite end of political spectrum. They welcome inquirers and those from other faith traditions.

Also has an awesome Minister of Music. In one service, the music can range from Plainchant to Dave Brubeck. Montview has a vibrant children and youth involvement, and is a More Light Presbyterian church, which works ""for the full  participation of LGBTQIA+ people in the life, ministry, and witness of the Presbyterian Church (USA)."" Montview is also a designated Sanctuary church for undocumented immigrants. Check it out at montview.org!"

6209,131599613,Doug Schuler,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,8 Dec 19,"These are not taxes or fees. Just the price of a bag that you are not required to buy. You only need to purchase plastic bags if you want. Personally I don‚Äôt want to buy a plastic bag so I bring my own.  If you think this is bad, the Mexican city I spend time in the winter has banned all bags and styrofoam. You don‚Äôt get the option to pay two pesos for a bag. You must bring your own."

6220,131599613,Eric Isbell,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,8 Dec 19,I fully support this. Anything to encourage people not to use plastic is ok in my book.
6221,131599613,Brad Patton,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,8 Dec 19,"Agree 100% on the plastics issue.  But, we need to create and keep focus on priorities:  traffic management, speeding and zoning issues are far and away needing our collective DENVER attention‚Äîfirst and foremost.

6229,146794338,Susan Dean,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 May 20,Robin Wells  I can testify that Robin's masks are great.  I was so glad to have her make some for me since I can't sew and they are almost impossible to buy.  Her masks are complex and beautifully made.
6230,146794338,Barbara Ruley,‚Ä¢ City Park,2 May 20,"Plus, it costs about five dollars a mask to make."
6231,146794338,Carol Ann Waugh,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,2 May 20,"You are welcome!  I am fortunate to be able to donate masks to support non-profits who serve the homeless, sick kids, or single moms.  As a fiber artist, I have LOTS of beautiful fabric and thread in my stash so my immediate expenses are limited.  But I understand why there are people who are selling masks on this site.  With all the unemployment in our community, people are trying to just make ends meet.   They deserve our support.   Believe me, no one is ""making a living"" by making masks that sell for $8-$12 dollars.  As Barbara said it costs about $5 in materials.  Plus labor.  I can make about 4 masks per hour (and I'm a FAST sewer!) so even at a minimum wage of $15.00/hour, that would add another $3.75 so actually, someone selling masks for $8.00 is losing 75 cents for every mask they sell."
6232,146794338,Sylvia Cohen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,2 May 20,I need  a mask; can you send a photo ; is there a choice of styles?
6233,146794338,Marissa Star,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,3 May 20,The numbers here may relate to a particular person you know making them but in honesty the price of creating a mask can be so varied depending on where the materials are sourced from and the labor/skillset of the person making them.
6234,146794338,Kammy Alford,‚Ä¢ City Park West,2 May 20,And you are too Barbara!!!
6235,146794338,Paul Chavez,‚Ä¢ Country Club,3 May 20,"Thanks either way.  Encourage everyone to wear a mask.  You could save someone!  Older, immune compromise or not in great health."

6261,135990600,Tim Russell,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,4 Feb 20,"This is interesting.  Maybe I‚Äôm not interpreting things correctly right now but is the current code that you can only have two unrelated adults no matter the size of the house or number of bedrooms? If that‚Äôs the case, much like a lot of our zoning, permitting, etc I doubt it‚Äôs being followed in the first place."
6262,135990600,Lauren Be,‚Ä¢ Skyland,4 Feb 20,"Tim Russell my neighbors at one point had 11 people living in an 900 sq ft. house. They had dogs who were never on leashes, they basically ignored the city's noise ordinances, and had multiple cars parked far beyond the three day rule of street parking in Denver. I was able to report all of these issues to the city, but it stemmed from them violating the current group-living rule. After the city's code enforcement came out, just like magic my neighborhood is quiet again. The group-living rule isn't always followed, but the city is responsive to code violations."
6263,135990600,Aldo Knaper,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,5 Feb 20,"Laura Baumgaartner Exactly! once the city removes the current zoning if a neighbor does this, you would have no recourse.  And good luck selling your house with that next door."
6264,135990600,Amy Wright,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Feb 20,Here is the link with meeting dates and lots of info:
6265,135990600,Jo Anne Kikel,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,4 Feb 20,Sounds horrible. Too many people in Denver now.. Time to sell and move.
6266,135990600,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,5 Feb 20,If u think it‚Äôs time to sell good luck with that and finding somewhere else to move. I don‚Äôt get u people it‚Äôs time to sell and move because u have a house in ur block or next door to u with a lot of people in it. Tell me how does how another persons living arrangements affect u?
6267,135990600,Aldo Knaper,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,5 Feb 20,Once/if the city removes the current zoning if a neighbor rents to a bunch of people/construction workers with cars/trucks you would have no recourse.  And good luck selling your house with that next door.
6268,135990600,Susan Young,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Feb 20,"One of my thoughts, exactly."
6269,135990600,Tiffany Sailler,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,5 Feb 20,People that want to live this way already are. I guarantee that law is not enforced. I doubt there will be any increase in households due to this law change.
6270,135990600,Aldo Knaper,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,5 Feb 20,Real estate investors are very good at exploiting weak zoning rules.  
6271,135990600,Lawrence Wysocki,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,7 Feb 20,"Good point.  And if the rental creates problems for the nearest neighbors, they may move and so on in a chain reaction that destroys a nice neighborhood.  The developers have Hancock in their back pocket because they funded his re-election campaign."
6272,135990600,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,5 Feb 20,"That rule is obscured especially since the cost of living is outrageous . Why does it matter how many people r in a house ? None of their business a persons living conditions. They have a roof over their head probably the best they can afford. A lot of families, it is their culture for the  all of the family to live together."
6273,135990600,Susan Young,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 Feb 20,Yes. A lot of extended families live together. The change is to increase from 2 unrelated adults living together to 8 unrelated adults and unlimited minors living together.
6274,135990600,Jo Anne Kikel,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 Feb 20,"Actually if a persons living conditions moves into the street such as with the smell of animal hoarders it will become other's business, wouldn't you agree? Blanket statements don't work."
6275,135990600,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,6 Feb 20,"What kind of group homes r these? Just families or, for people newly released from jail or what."
6276,135990600,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 Feb 20,"I think if people own their owns - no one has a right to tell them who can and can‚Äôt live in their home. As for renters, I highly doubt a rental company or landlord would allow 11+ people in a house. Renting is NOT cheap in Denver. My rental is $1,750 for a shitty, 675 sqft house. I need a roommate, if it was > 2 bedrooms I would have more roommates."
6277,135990600,Lawrence Wysocki,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,6 Feb 20,"People buy their homes with expectations that are determined to large degree by the characteristics of the neighborhood, which in turn is determined by city code.  It's not appropriate to alter the code so dramatically.  These are numbers I would expect for a neighborhood of opium dens."
6278,135990600,Susan Young,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,8 Feb 20,"Sadie, the city has codes and they allow how many unrelated people may live in a home."
6279,135990600,Lawrence Wysocki,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,6 Feb 20,"Perhaps it's a mistake and they mean 16,000 square feet for that many people.  1600 is too little even for 5 adults + minors."
6280,135990600,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,6 Feb 20,"It could be students trying to make ends meet or families rents can barley be afforded by one person or even 2, wages r not that great either, I‚Äôm sorry u feel u would have to move, the conditions could be worse."
6281,135990600,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,6 Feb 20,"I understand choosing a neighborhood by character, as long as rentals and Bonn exist anything is subject to change. Maybe a neighbor that is already established would be better but if it is sold things could still change. I‚Äôm sure people who moved to Cole, Whittier and five points did not consider the location but only the home they wanted to buy, inner city and urban city r different, the only way to get away from these things is suburbs, there is even crime there. Let ur concerns be known that‚Äôs all u can do."
6282,135990600,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,6 Feb 20,"It may be a way to work with the homeless population buy increasing multi family dwelling. I am not affected with this change right now but it could be a matter of time. Homes in my area r not large enough for multi family dwellings. I am a landlord and a person with that many people would not even look at my property for multi family dwelling not enough rom by far. My property is 3 bedroom I rent now. My tenant has been with me for over 10 years. That‚Äôs a blessing for me, it is a single mom and 2 kids."
6283,135990600,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,7 Feb 20,"Yes if that is the case but that is an extreme example, doesn‚Äôt happen that much where it could  be noticed, it is at that point someone‚Äôs business. But not my problem to just move, the city or whoever else would deal with that problem. Not worth giving up my house to move, there are other choices."
6284,135990600,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,7 Feb 20,"Why profile, OMG, I can‚Äôt believe, the responses of some of the neighbors on ND.? Team work makes the dream work, so quit complaining which usually will get u no where unless directed to the correct officials"

I am sure the next time whatever group someone on this thread wants to protest or assemble, you probably don‚Äôt want to be blasted for it.  It‚Äôs a two way street.  If you don‚Äôt like it, then move on.  It‚Äôs part of the constitution and that‚Äôs the way it is.  No need to blast or be unkind.  If they are in their vehicles it is social distancing, the ones who do not will pay the price themselves and for others unfortunately.  It is a choice."

It has a beautiful African textile print (blue and yellow), so if a fashionable man would like it, please everyone, let me know.

6321,132468391,Tallon VanNoy,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,19 Dec 19,I know the trash problem is always relevant but there was a rally/protest downtown last night so it could be from that as well.

6323,132468391,Eleni Sarris,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,1y,"The city requires that the event sponsors clean the area thoroughly after a big event. If they don't, the city can retain fees from the permit to reimburse for additional clean up activities. They can also charge the sponsor for damages. Typically Parks will also close off areas that are being overused to allow the grass to recover. There are maintenance crews that cover the park as well as a nonprofit, called Civic Center Conservancy, which also helps with park related issues. You may want to contact the Conservancy and also Parks and Recreation. Given the proximity of the park to city services, it will continue to be a place for homeless to gather until we, as a city, can address the issues facing homeless persons in a comprehensive fashion.(edited)"
6324,132468391,Stacy Decker,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,19 Dec 19,"Hey Laurie, this has been an issue for many years now and just one of the factors that city council passed their camping bans. Still, the city doesn‚Äôt really have any incentive to clean up every day and to date I have not heard a good solution to the problem."

6327,132468391,Jorge Casares,‚Ä¢ Hale,19 Dec 19,I think a huge issue across the city is the lack of accessible trash receptacles.

6334,148110433,Rachel Medina,‚Ä¢ Western Hills,16 May,I think they give them warnings. A few weeks ago they were going through there and noticed one had loaded there stuff up in the back of a pick up to move their stuff so it wouldn‚Äôt get thrown.

6363,152788336,Peter Gietl,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,25 Jun,Are you advocating someone who‚Äôs been sexually assaulted not contacting the police? Are you high?
6364,152788336,Edward Hoffman,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Jun,"I do not think the above advocated not contacting the police regarding a sexual assault at all. Nowhere does that seem to even come up. The Elijah McClain case has no mention of sexual assault. This new comment is inflammatory, diverting and misleading. The above was to expand information, options and resources for people. Especially when just about everyone (on all sides) agrees that we need more and better mental health resources in this country.  This comment incorrectly and inappropriately tries to make this a black-&-white, us-versus-them argument. How can that be helpful in any functioning society."
6365,152788336,Chris Platt,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,25 Jun,"Uh, I am 100% calling the cops if sexual assault is involved. And the mere fact that that was included on this list makes me doubt the rest."
6366,152788336,Edward Hoffman,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Jun,"Mental Health services, Food Access, Homelessness. There are good resources on this list. just mark out those you do not agree with. Eliminating everything else makes little sense to me."
6367,152788336,Peter Gietl,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,25 Jun,"Edward Hoffman I appreciate you acknowledging that it said that. I‚Äôm merely pointing it‚Äôs dangerous to advocate things with little thought to how they result. I‚Äôm absolutely proud of calling it larping because that‚Äôs what it is . I‚Äôm not on board to move our society to together to a better place ( what an absolutely insipid and meaningless platitude ) when marxists are leading this. I‚Äôm watching statues of abolitionists and American heroes like tedy Roosevelt get destroyed by the mob. I lived through the gang war here in the summer 92 did you? Have you ever experienced violent crime because I have. I‚Äôve visited third world countries with non functioning police forces, have you?"
6368,152788336,Edward Hoffman,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Jun,"I was not here in 1992. I was not involved in world war 2. i was not involved in the influenza epidemic of the 1918. I was not involved in the black death bubonic plague. i do believe in science and progress. I do believe you are distorting what is going on in our society right now - yes there are some bad actors and excessive actions. how does that excuse white supremacy, slavery, or repressive police states? it is a false (fake news) argument that this is all a mob of marxists and that we are moving towards a 3rd world country with a non-functioning police force. You could help moving things in the right direction (because it will move somewhere) but everything you are writing will just distort and overwhelm any meaningful diaglogue. If you believe every person for himself, don't help your neighbor up but just leave him down, oppress anyone different from you, and the police and laws are to keep the rich rich and the poor poor, then we really have nothing to say. I do believe in law and order and fairness. I also believe this world and humans have more faults then good qualities; how many wars do we have? is Denver getting hot enough for you (or do you not believe in science or climate change either)? You may want to live in an imperfect world and keep it so, or make it even worse. I believe differently, and am not wasting more time on this."
6369,152788336,Widicker Ava,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Jun,I agree the gang war was rough.  I have vivid stories from that time as a charge nurse.  It was rough
6370,152788336,Peter Gietl,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,25 Jun,"Edward Hoffman respectfully you‚Äôre putting words in my mouth, and that‚Äôs a lazy argument. So basically you haven‚Äôt witnessed gang violence or seen the affects of these terrifying policy proposals, and me as someone who has experienced them is pointing this out yet you dismiss me as being backwards. My great great great great grandfather died at Vicksburg fighting to end slavery, the other side of my family died in Buchenwald, excuse me if I don‚Äôt feel the need express white guilt. In fact I believe people should be judged by content of their character not by the color of their skin. I don‚Äôt believe in group guilt for your ancestors. When I spent time in Germany I didn‚Äôt blame the grandchildren for the crimes of some of their families. In the mean time i would take a step back and ponder why people advocate not calling 911 in the case of sexual assault."

6376,152788336,Lela Kay,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,25 Jun,You can call whomever you want>  And please keep politics off of these neighborhood post.  Why don't you just forward it to your email contact list and spare the rest of us from reading your opinions.
6377,152788336,Lela Kay,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,25 Jun,"And note to the editors or the people who oversee this website, FYI  I don't need to read political opinions, or be on nextdoor.  But it was helpful today because a neighborhood dog fell into our window well and the owner posted that his dog was lost and I contacted him.  That is useful information, politics - not so much."
6378,152788336,Michael Sanchez,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Jun,"Sorry, I could and have been clearer, STAR is a response for people in a mental health crisis. Deescalation and support  are offered for people in those circumstances. If necessary police will be involved, so far they have not been needed. The approach adds one more step in de-stigmatizing mental health issues. The program was featured in the Denverite recently. 720-913-STAR. Stay well folks."
6379,152788336,Barbara Ferguson,‚Ä¢ City Park West,26 Jun,"I‚Äôve never heard of star. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs political to realize mentally ill people can be frightened by police and it‚Äôs good to have an alternative. But who staffs STAR. People have to go voluntarily, right?  Aren‚Äôt police and psychiatrists only ones that can place a MH hold."
6380,152788336,Michelle Hattasch,‚Ä¢ City Park,25 Jun,Thank you SO MUCH for posting this!
6381,152788336,Kelly Kristine,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,26 Jun,Love this. Thank you!
6382,152788336,Tara Cisneros,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,26 Jun,Thank you for the info! I‚Äôm sorry people have to pick apart every little thing! People will twist and turn every thing just to find something wrong!! This is a great resource!
6383,152788336,Beth Turner,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,28 Jun,Thank you for the list and the info on STAR.  I hope both are widely distributed so we all learn that who to call depends on the situation.
6384,133146870,Bonnie McCay,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,"Sweetie is great for a child. I‚Äôm not offended by it but women are not sweeties, unless of course they are ‚Äúyour‚Äù sweetie! üòä"
6385,133146870,Jim Celmer,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,Miss Bonnie you have a valid point. When I give someone a compliment I want to hear it the way I mean it. Not take offense
6386,133146870,Bonnie McCay,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,Jim Celmer you are very considerate!
6387,133146870,Jim Miller,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,1y,"I was born in a small west Texas town many years ago at a time and place where manners and respect were taught..and just as important as the lessons I learned in school. Now as a ""mature"" gentleman from the south..Ma'am is the preferred greeting to a lady that I have never encountered before. To a lady that will recognize me from a previous crossing of paths sweetheart or dear is acceptable..in my humble opinion. I would never address a stranger as sweetie.(edited)"
6388,133146870,Jim Celmer,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,I also have difficulty remembering names so I go to sweetie. I‚Äôm so sorry ladies

6390,133146870,Lia Kozatch,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,29 Dec 19,"It can be perceived as condescending by some. It‚Äôs about context. Generally, I only let people close to me use something like that. If you don‚Äôt have an equal or clear relationship with the recipient, best to not use it."
6391,133146870,Lia Kozatch,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,29 Dec 19,"Also, age and gender of the person calling me ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù does have an impact. Best to be mindful of that as well. :)"
6392,133146870,Lisa Bird,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,29 Dec 19,Sweetie is an endearment saved for people in your inner circle. I would find it unnerving if someone not dead to my heart (and older) used it when speaking to me.
6393,133146870,Jim Celmer,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,I promise I‚Äôm just trying to be nice. I will change how I talk. Thanks for helping me.
6394,133146870,Dimore Emma,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,2 Jan 20,Oh my!!!! It offends to be nice!
6395,133146870,Sydney Stone,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,"I believe in the north that being called ma'am, sweetie or dear is perceived as ""OMG--I'm old!"" "
6396,133146870,Jim Celmer,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,Miss Bonnie. Would you prefer Ma‚Äôam or miss? I‚Äôm being honest.  I will switch out sweetie  for the right word. Thanks.
6397,133146870,Signe Linart,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,29 Dec 19,"Absolutely, Ma'am. ""Miss"" is the correct title for my 11 year old granddaughter. I notice many young people addressing 70 year old me as ""miss"", which I find very condescending. I've earned the title ""Ma'am."""
6398,133146870,Bonnie McCay,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,"Yes, I would lean towards Ma‚Äôam."
6399,133146870,Evelinda Urman,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,"Today, people are always looking for a reason to be offended and run to their safe spaces.  So try to restrain yourself. It does not offend me.  But then, I'm looking for joy...not a reason to be offended."
6400,133146870,G inger Nielson,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,29 Dec 19,Ditto. 
6401,133146870,Barbara M.,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,29 Dec 19,I agree 100% Evelinda. I don‚Äôt mind being called sweetie because I look at the intent behind it.
6402,133146870,Joshua Wilson,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,"Jim, one thing I learned long ago is to be authentic and not be what others want you to be. Soon as you do, they're in charge, exactly what they want. "
6403,133146870,Kimberly Nelson,‚Ä¢ Country Club,29 Dec 19,Ok sweetie.
6404,133146870,Bama Sandford,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,29 Dec 19,"Im southern and I call people sweetie, baby, honey, pumpkin,  peaches, sweet xheeks, etc. If they are offended, thats their problem. Im not going to censor myself .. idiots getad and 'offended"" if yoy call them ma'am or sir!!ü§£ü§£ü§£ Just keeping being you and live your life. People look for reasons to be upset and you dont need all that!"
6405,133146870,Bonnie McCay,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,"I agree with you with exception, sweetie, you are not in the south!   Those from the north have another language and it would be nice to have a happy medium.   I‚Äôve lived all over the country and it just feels better to fit in rather than rock the boat."
6406,133146870,Bama Sandford,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,6 Jan 20,"Bonnie McCay well, we are supposed to accept. everyone, right Sweetie? Maybe Colorado needs  sweetness from the south! Ive also lived all over and never had a problem with sweetie or any term lol. Maybe the problem lies with the offended. I mean what a ridiculous thing to be upset about regardless of location ."
6407,133146870,Pontem Relinquere,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,29 Dec 19,Ignore the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù people who are looking to be offended. Intent is everything. Most rational and emotionally mature people understand that.
6408,133146870,Joshua Wilson,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,There's an inverse correlation between one's level of wokeness and emotional intelligence...

6411,133146870,Sydney Stone,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,"I get that--the truck-stop waitress calling you sweetie is expected, a cliche, a movie moment! Not offensive at all to me. Usually the director has her chewing gum as well."
6412,133146870,Angie Pitha,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,29 Dec 19,I‚Äôm Southern too. And I advise against it. Thanks for posing the question. You sound like a great guy.
6413,133146870,Judith Clausen,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,1y,"It may not be offensive but I don't like it. Take the trouble to find out my name and use it. BTW, I'm 79, and I've felt that way all my adult life.(edited)"

6415,133146870,Robert Siefken,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,29 Dec 19,Jim - I think it's great you're asking the question - I sent you a Private Message with my response.
6416,133146870,Jim Stimson,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,29 Dec 19,Are you calling women or men sweetie?
6417,133146870,Kristen Edel,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,29 Dec 19,"I understand the intent, but it can be offensive in the wrong context. Do you have a southern accent? Did you just ask your equal female coworker to get you coffee ""sweetie""? Ooof thats condecending. Are you warning a stranger about a puddle in the sidewalk ""look out, sweetie""? Perfectly fine. Are you asking a stranger out for the first time? No, too forward .""What makes you think I am your sweetie after talking to you for less than 3 min?"" This one might just be my hangup. Are you speaking to a child? Sure go for it."
6418,133146870,Sydney Stone,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,"Yeah, Ma'am is a scary line in the sands of Time... I advise defaulting to 'miss', always."
6419,133146870,Linda Bocek,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill Central,29 Dec 19,"I agree that context matters, but unless talking to little children, probably best to err on the side of not calling women ""sweetie.""  I'm sure it's a cultural thing.  It seems as if some places use Mr. and Mrs. (usually Miss) followed by a first name.  That always sounds strange and a bit condescending to me.  Just my first name is fine, or Mrs./Ms and my last name.  But I do understand cultural differences and don't feel too upset. I will ask someone I interact with regularly to just call me by my first name."
6420,133146870,Giselle Cummings,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,29 Dec 19,I'd just stick with m'am or miss. I don't like being called sweetie by strangers.
6421,135804957,Lynn Stubbart,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,1 Feb 20,Sorry that happened to you...frightening.  Sad people out there that desperately need helpüò™
6422,135804957,Kammy Alford,‚Ä¢ City Park West,1 Feb 20,"Thank you and glad you both are okay.  I am very cautious about getting in and out of my garage.  PLEASE lock your car the second you get in it.  Also lock your car when putting gas in your car.  You are distracted and thieves will reach in and grab your wallet, purse, etc."
6423,135804957,Heather Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,1y,Yup! I do this all the time! I learned in college to lock my car door as someone tried to get into my car at a stop sign one night!(edited)
6424,135804957,Simon Lofts,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,2 Feb 20,Awful. Really awful.
6425,135804957,Phil Nash,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,3 Feb 20,"Denver voters passed Caring 4 Denver, a sales tax increase to provide, initially, $45 million a year for mental health and addiction services. We should all become familiar with this new mental health funding source and make our taxpaying voices heard about our community priorities. http://caring4denver.org/"
6426,135804957,Marvia Valdez,‚Ä¢ Hale,2 Feb 20,Wow!  You said he slipped in as you entered.  I often push my opener as I round a corner when I can't see the garage door yet.  From now on I'll be waiting until I'm close to the garage before opening the door.
6427,135804957,Renee Boudreaux,‚Ä¢ Hale,11 Feb 20,"...Which makes this extra scary, because, 1) he may have been waiting for her to come home (like, having been watching her house, knows her schedule, etc), and 2) despite acting as though he had been ‚Äúcaught‚Äù, he knew that she was going to be aware of his presence, and still didn‚Äôt care, which can be interpreted that he was willing/planning to take aggressive actions against her."
6428,135804957,Anna Kaye,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,2 Feb 20,Lynn - this sounds so frightening. I‚Äôm so sorry.
6429,135804957,Denise Donaldson,‚Ä¢ City Park West,2 Feb 20,Thanks for the heads up!  I will be more diligent. I‚Äôm so happy neither of you got hurt. It could have ended badly.
6430,135804957,Wendy Schroeder,‚Ä¢ City Park West,2 Feb 20,That's scary and I'm glad you are okay. I've had people try to slip into my apartment building when I'm entering or leaving. I think some of them are looking for a warm place to stay.  It's sad the richest country in the world can give aid to the mentally ill and homeless. There are over a million in America.
6431,135804957,Karen Kiggins,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,2 Feb 20,"Thank you for sharing this.  I can't imagine how unsettling that was.  I come late from work and always wait until the garage is closed before getting out of the car, but I never thought someone might have already slipped inside.  So scary!  I hope you and your daughter are ok!  Thanks for making us all more aware."
6432,135804957,Lynn Turner,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,2 Feb 20,"Anna Kaye We are fine, it was a bit startling and definitely scary at moments, but as it turned out...he got a few things off his chest that were important to him and no one was hurt.  Sometimes"
6433,135804957,Susan Dean,‚Ä¢ Hale,2 Feb 20,"That's wonderful, Lynn.  You truly are a beautiful person and a lovely example for your daughter."
6434,135804957,Gina Thorpe,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,2 Feb 20,Wow wow wow
6435,135804957,Lynn Turner,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,2 Feb 20,One tip I was given is to back into the garage so I can see anyone entering before I exit the car.  The police told me next time to get back in the car and call 9-1-1.  Hope this helps someone else if ever in that situation...
6436,135804957,Heather Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 Feb 20,Um...yeah!
6437,135804957,Oat Whitney,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,3 Feb 20,I agree with backing in...you can stay in your car until the door goes down and if someone follows you in just drive out...we also always lock the door from the garage into the house so the intruder couldn‚Äôt get into the house.
6438,135804957,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,2 Feb 20,"I'm glad you're ok and that it was just a lonely, disturbed man and not someone violent. I am heartened by all the responses showing compassion (as well as your post!) for the man.  But also thanks for the reminder for everyone to be more aware of their surroundings.  That's always good advice."
6439,135804957,Heather Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 Feb 20,Wow! This is one of my worst fears and have prepared myself in what to do in this situation. My plan is to NOT engage in chit chat but start blowing the horn and sound the alarm while calling 911. Glad you're safe.
6440,135804957,Marsha P.,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,2 Feb 20,jimminy crickets..so scary...so so glad you are both OK..and hope you stay that way..
6441,135804957,Ry Bryan,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 Feb 20,Scary! Be smart and don't get out of the car without checking mirrors and doing a blindspot check. This might be the same man caught in our alley a few weeks ago! Sadly he only got community service despite violating his probation and repeatedly returning to our neighborhood!
6442,135804957,Lynn Turner,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,3 Feb 20,"Thanks for sharing Robby.   Was the man stopped in Park Hill slipping into garages and trespassing or what was he caught doing and on probation for?  Thanks, I think awareness of repeat behavior is helpful to know for neighbors."
6443,135804957,LInda Poletti,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 Feb 20,"Yikes.  One  of my fears too because sadly this happened a few years ago to a friend in Crestmoor.  Someone came into the garage when she pulled in with her son (13yo) and they beat her to steal her purse.  I've also heard of a local situation where a man demanded that the woman drive to an ATM (at gunpoint) for money.  the garages (and alleys) are ripe for these types of crimes because the victim is startled and also has no escape.  I actually sit in my locked car every time I pull in to the garage, day or night, until my door is down before I get out.  I think about these two incidences every time I pull in.  I am so grateful that in the current situation it turned out ok."
6444,135804957,Lynn Turner,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,3 Feb 20,That's so awful.  I'm very sorry to hear that...I feel grateful nothing bad happened and now will be more aware.
6445,135804957,Marsha P.,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,3 Feb 20,WHAT A scary scary world anymore WAY WAY TO TOO TWO 2 scary people everywhere....so sososo SAD..

I apologized to him, but told him I didn't know him, didn't live there and had to let the door close behind me.  He said no problem and had a code to get in.

You can make sourdough starter from flour and water which then has heaps of yeast and then you can make stuff with the discard after you feed it every day.

I can't tell from this post if the person had it back in April and they are telling you, or if this was recent.  I'm going to avoid Target for a little bit just in case because if 1 employee had it, it's likely that others contracted it as well.  I really, really appreciate this information.

It's from the Colorado Dept. of Health website, so they won't state which one, just that it's in Denver."
6490,148067362,Scott Hughes,‚Ä¢ Hale,14 May,There was one employee at the King Soopers on Chestnut Place (20th and Wewatta by Union Station) a couple months ago. Maybe other employees at that one; I haven't heard of any others.

6496,148067362,Stephanie Long,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,14 May,"I don't think anyone needs to worry about this. They have cleaned multiple times since then, and let's be honest, I am sure there have been a lot of people who have been in and out of the store and have had the virus as well as other employees. This goes for many other businesses that are currently open. Take precautions, yes, but just note there is no foolproof way to avoid catching this. You would have to never leave your house again to be sure. I just read an article that a virologist was recently diagnosed with it and he took every precaution possible. He contracted it through his eyes."
6497,148067362,Terrell Kennet,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,14 May,"Wow! So now we'll have to wear a mask that covers not only our nose & mouth, but also our EYES??  lol"
6498,148067362,Mitra Wagner,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,14 May,"I think posts like this are helpful.  In this case, if this was really back in April when the employee got sick, and no one has been sick since, it's not necessary to be afraid or avoid Target.  But, in the case of King Soopers, the date of the illness being on May 12th and 8 staff members sick, I think it's better to avoid.  Those 8 staff members could have spread it to others who are asymptomatic and could spread it to you.   With masks and distancing, that's still unlikely but maybe avoiding the store for a couple of weeks and watching the outbreak information on the CDPHE website, makes sense to me."
6499,148067362,Mitra Wagner,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 May,"April Link from the string above, it sounds like the one downtown.  There are 8 cases of Covid positive staff as of May 12.  The Colorado department of health outbreak information just says King Soopers, Denver.  I wish they would have a little more transparency."

6552,143790047,Laura Partridge,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Apr 20,It‚Äôs not the stores responsibility to hand out gloves and masks to customers but I do agree that they should‚Äôve turned anyone away not wearing either gloves or mask. I also thought they were monitoring how many people they allow in? King soopers is actually restricting how many people are allowed in even more so now.
6553,143790047,Laura Partridge,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Apr 20,Jason Wissner you said in your post ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt these stores giving protective gear like masks and gloves to their customers‚Äù
6554,143790047,Patty Purves,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,7 Apr 20,I also shopped at the Sageway on Krameria and observed they DID enforce social distancing in the cashier lines. However they didnt offer any cart wipes and there was no evidence they were sanitizing the cart handles themselves.  People in the store were mostly distancing themselves and most had masks on.  I notices the ones who didnt were older (60+ I'm guessing).  Nor did they respect the distancing of placing purchases on the belt before mine were all scanned and bagged.  Please reiterate the social distancing guidelines with your parents and grandparents!  The cashier had both mask and gloves.  She seemed very stressed.  Who can blame her?

6557,143790047,Laura J Porter,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,8 Apr 20,I was at Walmart yesterday and noticed that many of the employees didn‚Äôt wear masks...üòê
6558,143790047,Chris opi,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,8 Apr 20,"As a nurse on the front line I see alit if unsafe behavior in public . people should avoid gloves. They are not sterile, actually spread germs if you don‚Äôt remove them ie when you touch the keypads, dig into your purse and climb into your car. Use sanitizer or was them hands.  Yes they should be wearing non n95 masks which are being diverted to the frontline workers."
6559,143790047,Clare Rothchild,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,1y,"Fellow nurse here. YES AND YES>  The virus is not absorbed through the skin on your hands. Gloves are also designed as one time use only, for a patient procedure and then discarded and hands should then be washed. I'm seeing people wearing them in stores etc throughout their trip. Because of the 'sticky' nature of the material they are actually shown to attract viruses etc and are less safe than your hands. God forbid you touch your face while wearing them! Just use hand sanitizer or wash your hands as soon as you are able and try not to touch your face until you can do that. . I would be very unhappy to see a single pair of gloves being worn all day in the stores by employees....it's bad enough seeing customers wearing them. Yes to cotton masks for everyone.(edited)"
6560,143790047,Suzi Scher,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,8 Apr 20,I agree...
6561,143790047,Steven Ziegler,‚Ä¢ Lowry,8 Apr 20,Same with Safeway in lowry including the Starbucks in Safeway in lowry. When asked the other day they said wearing gloves was optional.
6562,143790047,Suzi Scher,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,8 Apr 20,No no... I would not get a drink from that Starbucks.
6563,143790047,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Apr 20,And I didn't even know that Starbucks is an essential service. Learn something every day.
6564,143790047,Steven Ziegler,‚Ä¢ Lowry,8 Apr 20,Say what you want about Whole Foods but I‚Äôve witnessed them wiping down food in cans and boxes before putting on shelves as well as all employees wearing masks and gloves. Very different experience than Safeway.
6565,143790047,Terrell Kennet,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,8 Apr 20,"And I also find Marczyk's to be commendable! I have an excellent sense of smell, & I was getting a very faint whiff of ""Clorox"" at the refrigerated cases, down each aisle, etc. Was there yesterday---everybody masked, baskets wiped, sneeze-guards @ checkout, etc."
6566,143790047,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Apr 20,Quite commendable. I generally shop Safeway but lately they don't seem to be stocking their shelves to have things available even first thing in the mornings and have been out of most of what I am going shopping to get. I've had to develop work-arounds and find alternative sources for things I need.
6567,143790047,Chris opi,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,8 Apr 20,I also have had to stop people from handing me receipts with their gloves on after touching many peoples stuff and money ahead of me

If you insist on keeping your dogs outside, please don't chain them up!  They at least need to able to be mobile in your yard to get away/defend themselves, if necessary.  Thank you!"

6582,139629527,H Paul Cohen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Mar 20,"Raccoons may be cute looking but they are among the most dangerous & pestiferous wild animal species you are likely encounter in the city. Their feces are extremely toxic and contain a number of pathogens including ringworm that are dangerous to humans. They like to raise their young in chimneys and attics in the city. We have had problems with them getting into the ceiling insulation in our warehouse in Commerce City. They are meat eaters and can (and will) kill any domestic animal in an altercation. They often carry rabies. Not good to have around. Report to animal control. And here is the irony: They are a protected as a fur bearing game animal in most states (including Colorado)and can only be killed in season and with a license. Otherwise you have to trap and ""relocate"" them."
6583,139629527,Kammy Alford,‚Ä¢ City Park West,9 Mar 20,"H Paul, thanks for the additional information.  My experience with Animal Control is that they will not intervene if the raccoon is mobile.  Their words is we will not ""chase it down"".  They came after I called again and explained that the raccoon was barely mobile and obviously very sick.  Also, if you do trap them humanely and relocate them, don't advertise it (wink, wink) and take them at least ten miles away near a water source and wooded area so they have half a chance of survival.  My two cents."

6614,143822342,Danielle Davis,‚Ä¢ City Park,10 Apr 20,"thanks for the offer, but i was able to find some hand soap during a quick run to Walmart!"
6615,143822342,Danielle Davis,‚Ä¢ City Park,10 Apr 20,And thanks to those that have donated other cleaning supplies to me! I appreciate it so much!!
6616,142368579,Meg Houser,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,28 Mar 20,Target had toilet paper yesterday when they first opened!

6620,142368579,Vivian Nguyen,‚Ä¢ Central Park,28 Mar 20,"I saw toilet paper, tissue, breads, cereals, napkins, etc at Target. I was there today around 7:20am."

6624,142368579,Jessika Lawyer,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,28 Mar 20,"Nancy, i asked at Target in Glendale about hand sanitizer and was told they receive shipments every single night with sanitizer and TP. They open at 7am and it is sold out by 9am. So get to Target when they open."
6625,142368579,Keegan Perkins,‚Ä¢ Central Park,28 Mar 20,I would befriend some grocery store worker. Ask them to get you some. Slip them a 20. Password is flush.
6626,142368579,Nancy Wiseman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,28 Mar 20,Thank you for all these helpful posts. It seems that we need to be in the stores when they open to get T paper as it is gone in a few hours. (or minutes) Will keep after it but no wonder it goes so fast.  Hoarding begets hoarding.
6627,142368579,Gail Schultz,‚Ä¢ Central Park,29 Mar 20,I ordered this from Johnstown paper company in PA. Takes 5-7 business days. The money is used to clean up the town.
6628,142368579,Merle Levy,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,29 Mar 20,How did you learn to do so? I am willing to help out.
6629,142368579,Nancy Wiseman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,29 Mar 20,Thanks for the tip I will try them Plus I had a neighbor drop off a few rolls People can be so wonderful and kind. Who'd of thought toilet paper (and many other small  needs) would bring us together. (:
6630,142368579,De hervey Hervey,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,29 Mar 20,The Walmart on Quebec Street has toilet paper. You have to go to the back of the store and request it. They have it separate from everything else. Good luck also Walgreens have their truck delivery on Wednesday at noon and they have toilet tissue there after. Good luck to you!
6631,142368579,Merle Levy,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,1y,I have had luck at Soopers on Leetsdale and Target but you need to get there by 9:30 am. I do not think that stores restock during the day.(edited)
6632,142368579,Jen Stone,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,29 Mar 20,I have heard that the stores in the suburbs are more likely to have TP.
6633,142368579,Alina Martell,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,29 Mar 20,Target on Colorado this morning had plenty.
6634,142368579,Beth Ritland,‚Ä¢ Central Park,29 Mar 20,Toilet paper is at Walmart in Stapleton right now 2:30 pm

6636,142368579,Cristino Griego,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,29 Mar 20,Chocolate lab has tp
6637,142368579,Holly Farmer,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 Apr 20,Try Western Paper Distributors at Havana and I-70.  They normally sell to businesses but they've made stock available to individuals.
6638,130141827,Rosy Noriega,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,1y,Hello Kristin! The Denver Dream Center has an event called ‚ÄúSantas Elves‚Äù in December! They need hundreds of volunteers and you had deliver donated gifts to a family that will be at the event. You can also sign up to adopt a family! Visit their website for more details! My 4 year old did it last year and still talks about it!! Denverdreamcenter.org(edited)
6639,130141827,Holly Reef,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Nov 19,Take a look at Impact Denver.  They feed and cloth the homeless.  They also have a free store that the homeless can come an shop for an outfit.  Wonderful group.  They even have a Santa gift giving party. My good friend brings her daughter.  It‚Äôs a wonderful family event.
6640,130141827,Maggie W.,‚Ä¢ Hale,19 Nov 19,Maybe something where you could assemble and hand out bagged lunches?
6641,130141827,Gavin MacFarlane,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,19 Nov 19,"My wife and I have done Meals on Wheels around the Holidays with our little ones in years past. They always seem to be happy to have volunteers to give their usual drivers a break this time of year. And many of the recipients seem to really light up when they see kids in-tow. Maybe a bit clich√© of a volunteer opportunity but both my wife and I had grandparents that benefited from that program. So it‚Äôs nice to pay it back, if only a little."
6642,130141827,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,20 Nov 19,"Not sure what u would really like to do but at Christmas many organizations give dinners and food away to the homeless, that might be a little frightening. One year my church was doing meals for the homeless in civic center park I took my teenage daughter to help with the process. It is good to teach our children to not be on the receiving end all the time but to learn how to give as well, it is a lesson that adults need to learn as well, I commend you for even thinking about exposing ur child at such a young age, we hear about children on the news creating ways to help others, it amazes me but I know those parents are so proud. I don‚Äôt really know of anything for such a young age, but u r awesome for even wanting to expose ur chip to giving at such a young age. It really goes a long way as they get older."
6643,130141827,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,22 Nov 19,"By the way my daughter I took to volunteer with me is a CNA, and that is truly a job that requires u to give a lot of you, honestly more than I could, working and taking care of combative alztimers patients at the least and she said she likes her job which is a hard thing for a lot of people to say. She is currently going to school to become a respiratory  therapist . She‚Äôs very determined to be in a medical position, she also was influenced by my mom a nurse, and her great grand dad a doctor. Also maybe a sense of job Security"

6646,154319803,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,9 Jul,direct link to a more readable map/calendar/instructions for Extra Trash:
6647,154319803,Nina B.,‚Ä¢ Sloans/Highlands,9 Jul,Thanks for this link. I downloaded the pdf file and found the instructions easy to follow.
6648,154319803,Drenna C.,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,9 Jul,I see 5 is niw GVR!
6649,154319803,Brenda N.,‚Ä¢ Hampden,9 Jul,But now they are collecting large items half as often :/ How does this help with the increase?
6650,154319803,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,9 Jul,Budget cuts. We pay the price.
6651,154319803,Amanda H.,‚Ä¢ Globeville,9 Jul,Yea that makes sense.... higher demand so lets make you wait double the time! People already dump trash in unauthorized areas due to lack of pickups
6652,154319803,Chris Metzger,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,13 Jul,"I agree, it makes perfect sense. It takes them longer to pick up more stuff with the current resources."
6653,154319803,Dylan W.,‚Ä¢ CBD,9 Jul,Really disappointing. More trash yet less collections. This will increase litter and give people more time to rummage through everyone's excess.
6654,154319803,Amanda H.,‚Ä¢ Globeville,9 Jul,"I just tried looking at the calendar and i dont see a pickup anywhere, i looked through December"
6655,154319803,shannon f.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,9 Jul,Ditto!
6656,154319803,Giuliana B.,‚Ä¢ Platt Park,9 Jul,recycle people recycle -
6657,154319803,Amanda H.,‚Ä¢ Globeville,9 Jul,I have 2 recycling bins! Im thinking of getting a third. But we still have items that dont fit in trash or recycle ‚ôªÔ∏è
6658,154319803,Sally Hodge,‚Ä¢ Lowry,9 Jul,"I may be thick in the head, but I can't make heads or tails of that map.  Is it possible to go back to the former way of inserting your home address and getting the calendar with the date?"
6659,154319803,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,43w,"Sally H. you can still do that, but the calendar won't be updated until the end of the week (according to a note hidden down the page) ‚Äî click ""View my collection schedule"" on the page the city linked, or use this direct link:"
6660,154319803,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,43w,"what they seem to be saying is that much more trash means the crews can't cover as much of the city in a day; there's no money to hire more crews and buy more trucks, so they've had to make the routes shorter; that means it takes longer before they can get back to each neighborhood(edited)"
6661,154319803,Lisa B.,‚Ä¢ Platt Park,9 Jul,"A lot of residents put things out for extra trash that can legitimately be donated. I just saw a neighbor discard a fridge (Xcel pays up to $75 for your old fridge in any condition) and bookshelves, that Goodwill or ARC would have accepted. Just because the city is willing to pick it up doesn't mean it makes sense to send it to the landfill."
6662,154319803,Amanda H.,‚Ä¢ Globeville,9 Jul,My neighborhood arc and goodwill wont come pick items up.
6663,154319803,Terry Hostetler,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,43w,The city created this problem when they took away the dumpsters. It takes more man hours to visit every single home than it did to dump four or five dumpsters in each block. And then on top of that they have to add extra work by adding the extra Trash crew.(edited)
6664,154319803,Nina B.,‚Ä¢ Sloans/Highlands,9 Jul,But not all areas had those dumpsters.
6665,154319803,Ron S.,‚Ä¢ Hampden South,9 Jul,"I can understand why the City is doing this from a budget perspective, but it is only going to result in more illegal trash dumping."
6666,154319803,Bernadette Langbein,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,9 Jul,Now we get to see longer periods of trash dumped in the alley.  How about extra trash can‚Äôt be placed in alley until week of  pickup?
6667,154319803,Basia Dziecharska,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Jul,That‚Äôs already a rule
6668,154319803,Cassie H.,‚Ä¢ Baker,9 Jul,Maybe im just crazy but i can not figure out when our new pick up day is?!?!?!?! 4Th and Elati
6669,154319803,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,9 Jul,Cassie Hernandez you are in the green zone ‚Äî see the green weeks on the calendar here:
6670,154319803,Matt Boggs,‚Ä¢ South Hilltop,9 Jul,"Well this sucks 'more demand, less service....."
6671,154319803,Katie Keltie,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,9 Jul,It's VERY frustrating for those of us who take the time to put the LIP dates on our calendars that you published the announcement the week of our scheduled LIP that was actually happened the PREVIOUS week and now it won't come again for EIGHT WEEKS. That's actually 13 WEEKS of no LIP. Almost 1/4 of the year at a time when many of us have yard debris.
6672,154319803,Basia Dziecharska,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Jul,"I‚Äôm sure once they iron it out, a simple call to 311 and you‚Äôll get your schedule. "
6673,154319803,Erin Nordlof,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Jul,"I agree it's pretty frustrating. It's been 5 weeks and I thought that they'd be picking up tomorrow but the website reads that now my address won't happen for another 8 weeks? So if it's supposed to start next week, why isn't it happening THIS week, Ms. Burke? Also, they missed my trash and recycling last week and I've submitted a ticket 3x with no response...."
6674,154319803,Thomas Potter,‚Ä¢ City Park West,9 Jul,"Same thing happened to me.  I complained to DOTI and Candi Di Baca on City Council, but no response yet."
6675,154319803,Joanne Davidson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Jul,"According to this, the large item pickup schedule is to be adjusted starting NEXT week. So then why won't there be large item pickup tomorrow (7/10) as per the original schedule?"
6676,154319803,Erin Nordlof,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Jul,That is my question too :)  https://www.denvergov.org/pocketgov/#/mySchedules/trash
6677,154319803,Diane C.,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,9 Jul,There will be Extra trash pickup this week if scheduled previously. Mine was today and they picked up. 311 said this week‚Äôs schedule is still good. Just not showing on website. I was confused too.  Change begins next week. Not sure why they took last week and this week‚Äôs schedule off the website-made it more confusing.
6678,154319803,Joanne Davidson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Jul,"I get the weekly email reminder of what will be picked up, and the one I received today made no mention of extra trash, even though 7/10 is the scheduled date for my neighborhood. It just listed regular trash and compost."
6679,154319803,shannon f.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,43w,"I have gone to the denver.org/trash and CANNOT get an extra trash recycle date for myself.  It is not on the calendar at all and when i  go to the icon for extra trash on the right hand side, the link for 'my schedule in the first  few lines does not have a schedule with ETC dates on it.  I can't figure out this silly map either.  We need to be able to put in our address and find out our dates or you are going to have a bunch of extra trash our when it shouldn't be!  PLEASE BE CLEAR and this is NOT clear.  As far as i can tell my address isn't even on this map and when i type in my address, i certainly don't get a map where any date has extra trash collection for my address on it.(edited)"
6680,154319803,Cynthia Ivers,‚Ä¢ Lowry,9 Jul,I had extra trash picked up today (always scheduled as today). When is your next scheduled extra trash pickup supposed to be (before the schedule change)?
6681,166020811,Kristine Lindholm,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,28 Oct,Not recommended. Likely to infect a guest or two. Is it worth the risk to all?
6682,166020811,Mag U.,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,28 Oct,Two households at most is my current understanding. Maybe consider going virtual (maybe with a fun recipe switch idea) so that everyone will be around to share the next one! Be well.
6683,166020811,Marisa Baldwin,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,28 Oct,Just live your life.  COVID is not going away.  Remember 99.8% recovery rate.
6684,166020811,Tim Krabacher,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,28 Oct,Unbelievable
6685,166020811,Edgar Neel,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,28 Oct,"We are struggling with the same problem.  If everyone can quarantine for the two weeks prior, it's probably OK.  Add a rapid test a day or two before, even better.  Anyone who cannot do those things should not attend."
6686,166020811,Sean Gallagher,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,27w,"Follow the rules. Gatherings of no more than five is the maximum currently allowed, and if things keep up at the current pace will be lower by Thanksgiving(edited)"
6687,166020811,Edgar Neel,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,28 Oct,into your heart it will creep

6689,166020811,Jim Miller,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,28 Oct,what are you so afraid of ?
6690,166020811,Sean Gallagher,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,29 Oct,Killing immune compromised family who have just as much of a right to exist as you do.
6691,166020811,Edgar Neel,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,28 Oct,"step out of line, the Man come and take you away"
6692,166020811,Marisa Baldwin,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,28 Oct,You ok there...Edgar?
6693,166020811,Edgar Neel,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,28 Oct,"For What It's Worth, yes"
6694,166020811,Jim Miller,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,28 Oct,stop now..what's that sound
6695,166020811,Jim Miller,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,28 Oct,everybody look what's goin round
6696,166020811,Laurie Jensen,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,28 Oct,"The city says you can‚Äôt have more than 5 people now. So I would say, ‚Äúpump the breaks‚Äù."
6697,166020811,Marisa Baldwin,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,28 Oct,üòÖüòÖ  Ridiculous.
6698,166020811,Sean Gallagher,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,29 Oct,Marisa Baldwin and you're not qualified to make that statement
6699,166020811,Aldo Knaper,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,28 Oct,"Just found out today that some friends of ours had a family gathering, everyone ended up testing positive today.  Many have pre-existing conditions."
6700,166020811,Laurie Jensen,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,28 Oct,"I have a family friend that just flew on a small private plane to Nebraska for bird hunting one of the passengers was positive when they left all eight person on the flight and their significant others now have COVID. Some have symptoms, some don‚Äôt, but they all get to quarantine for 14 days. That means no one gets to leave their homes for two weeks. Why would you even consider having such a party. It‚Äôs just Thanksgiving."
6701,166020811,Laurie Jensen,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,28 Oct,In their pockets
6702,166020811,Sharon Diamond,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,28 Oct,"I‚Äôm a nurse on the covid floor, beds are filling up fast, and younger and younger people are heading to the ICU.   Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday, I will miss having my family around the table but not worth the risk!  Unfortunately I will not be having dinner with my children and spouses.  Out of love for them and my work family.  Stay safe ."
6703,166020811,Penny Smith,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,28 Oct,"Thank you Sharon for all your hard work.  It must be so insulting to hear from all the disbelievers .Gee-does anyone think they cancelled the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, St Patrick's Day parade and the Stock Show for nothing?  All the concerts and Movies.  Restaurants closed? people laid off? Some people going hungry? Afraid of losing their housing?  I'm still amazed that there are disbelievers and somewhat pissed off that they would attack someone who would save their life regardless. You are a hero and many other essentials as well. "
6704,166020811,Laurie Jensen,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,28 Oct,"Just kidding, they all were wearing masks. That‚Äôs why they thought it would be fine sharing a tin can for an hour to go bird hunting."
6705,166020811,Gail Simon,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,28 Oct,5 people. Same family. That's what Dr. Fauci said.
6706,166020811,Sharon Diamond,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,28 Oct,"Penny Smith it‚Äôs extremely hard to hear the crap .. when I‚Äôm putting myself at risk, and having to come home each night after I arrange hospice service for so many families.  My heart breaks over and over."
6707,166020811,Lisa Colletti,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,30 Oct,"We are out here, Sharon, we just aren‚Äôt as loud and we don‚Äôt have time to taunt and smear online. But please know - we are here, masked up, distancing and thanking you every day"
6708,166020811,Kristi O'Dea,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,28 Oct,There is no way I would consider having a gathering of that size! Yikes!
6709,166020811,Francesca Cheroutes,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,28 Oct,"In places where masks are required - and people do it - the covid rates drop.  Look it up if you don‚Äôt believe what mask proponents are saying. You could even look at numbers on mask wearing from Europe or anywhere if you don‚Äôt trust our news. And when you decide EACH time you go out to wear a mask, think of not only the overwhelmed healthcare workers, but think of your community. If we all wear masks, we can do everything we can for our small businesses.  They can‚Äôt survive much more, if they are even still around. Wear your mask so they can stay open. Wear your mask to protect your neighbor and business owner. Wear your mask so you CAN go back to your favorite shops. It‚Äôs a little damn piece of cloth, for God‚Äôs sake, not a medieval torture device."
6710,144013637,Joanne Spillman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,9 Apr 20,They were all over the parking lot at the King Soopers on Leetsdale last Saturday. It's really shameful.
6711,144013637,Jason Wissner,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,9 Apr 20,There are a lot of people that live around the Mayfair area who litter all thr time. I bet none of them are using this app to know how sad and disappointing it is that they do that

Yet Target, Walmart, and other places are booming.  How come it's ok to park at Target but not at City Park.  How come it's ok to not social distance in a store like Target but it's not ok to be outside at a dog park.  I think they are on a power trip now to destroy all fun."

Trust people to make up their own minds on what they think is best and not the damned government. I stood watch for 20 years while you pathetic sheep do nothing but lay down and die.

6768,143695467,Beth Ritland,‚Ä¢ Central Park,7 Apr 20,You did hit the jackpot! Hand sanitizer is the grand prize. 
6769,143695467,Linda Stark,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,1y,I got absolutely everything I need to make hand sanitizer the aloe vera gel the lavender oil the tree tea oil and alcohol(edited)
6770,143695467,Beth Ritland,‚Ä¢ Central Park,7 Apr 20,I made my own already. Mine smell better than store too! So domestic of us...
6771,143695467,Linda Stark,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr 20,I don't even know why I didn't think of it before... I got bored yesterday trolling around on Google and saw the link for making hand sanitizer found that I couldn't order most of it on Amazon but Walmart had it
6772,143695467,Linda Stark,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,1y,Just just to let everyone know at both Walmart they had available great big bottle of refillable Lysol that you can put in a spray bottle and use as regular Lysol disinfectant(edited)
6773,143695467,Linda Stark,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr 20,I'm not really understanding why people are having such problems finding these things every store I went there were things available... okay with the exception of hand sanitizer.. granted they might not be my brand but I think we're all having to give a little somewhere so I can't get the normal toilet paper and you might have to be there at 7 a.m. but it's either that or well I just won't speak of the alternativeü§£ü§£

6783,143695467,Linda Stark,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr 20,I agree washing hands and hand sanitizer is the best way to kill germs but when I'm taking bags out of the car to leave on the porch of a senior citizen I have to have disposable gloves on... that's a personal choice I don't want to touch their bags with my bare hands
6784,143695467,Linda Stark,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr 20,And also when I'm in the grocery store and touching everything that others have already touched I have to have gloves on again a personal choice... I was kind of in disbelief this morning when I saw I don't know how many people in Walmart wearing face mask but no gloves grabbing everything on the shelves and moving things around no glovesü§îü§î
6785,148513289,Amy Pierce,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,18 May,Have you tried a pillow case instead of a cat bag? My 16 year old takes steroids everyday and I've had to result in dissolving his pills in water and giving the through a syringe. It tastes terrible for him but much less stress for both of us.

Mix with babyfood (Gerbers ham or one of the meats but NO garlic or onion) or Delectables Bisque (treat in a pouch) from Walmart which picky cat LOVES...you can add some warm water to release the aroma.  If that doesn't work, I use a bath towel and burrito 'em ‚ò∫"

6813,139619446,John Joseph N.,‚Ä¢ Harvey Park,6 Mar 20,That is exactly what having stations in rec centers and gov buildings means.  Did you even read the post?

So...great. But wait one minute. You see, Denver has this other major problem that no one including the city council and the mayor want to seriously address...its called the homeless population. Trash and needles scattered all over the sidewalks, tent cities with rats, deification at residences and storefronts, including the 16th street mall. How is this not a more immediate, serious threat to public health than this virus. How would you like to be a resident close to downtown or a business owner that has to power wash their storefront every morning before they open for business. Btw, the cities answer to helping these folks is fining them if they don‚Äôt clean the feces and garbage up."

In addition to the individuals who do this routinely, I'm guessing there are people who do this type of thing when the opportunity presents itself.  Maybe the package size fits into their backpack or maybe the labeling on the box gives a clue to what's inside.  Thank you Ruth McIntyre for your diligence.

6863,140944168,Leanne Duffy,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,19 Mar 20,I picked up an online grocery order at the Sprouts on Mississippi (they also deliver) and had no problem getting green vegetables.  My tip is when you create your order go ahead and pick substitutions or give good notes if they don't find exactly what you want it will help them get you something you do want!

That company you're touting isn't even in this neighborhood. I've worked for multiple dealers in my life and all they care about is the bottom line probably just like you do.

6875,145523311,Jon DeGuire,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,22 Apr 20,Monica Geocaris I would imagine that Jeffrey Silverberg has a multi million dollar advertising budget over there with Elway. He chooses to advertise on ND on a post that is giving a shout out to a small local business. That is quite the slime ball move.
6876,145523311,Justin Robinson,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,21 Apr 20,Agreed
6877,145523311,John Donofrio,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,22 Apr 20,Jeff and his crew have been helping our family for well over 20 years.

6879,145523311,John Sadwith,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,22 Apr 20,"Automotive Search is an Auto Broker.  We recently purchased a car through them because the dealer was being unreasonable, not price wise but procedure wise.  This was over the holidays and we found a car we liked but couldn't get the bank work done until the next Monday (this was a Friday).  We asked the dealer to hold the used car and they declined even after I offered a deposit.  Automotive Search got possession of the car within one hour and held it for me until I could get the money transferred from one bank to another.  They washed the car and had some missing things located and installed.  They were a delight to work with. We had great service and this is another small business to consider patronizing if you are looking for a new or used car.  Thanks Debi and all for your comments about Jeff.  What a stand up person he is!!"
6880,145523311,Mary Mathews,‚Ä¢ Lowry,22 Apr 20,We have been taking our vehicles to Jeff for about 20 years. Our three adult children now take their vehicles to him.  He is honest and his crew at Paris tire do a great job!

6886,145523311,Stacey Folk,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,22 Apr 20,I have gone there for many years and love them!
6887,145523311,Carmen Isler,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,22 Apr 20,"Went there one time because my engine light was on. Charged me $121.16 then told me that I would have to pay over $2k for repairs. When I said I would take the car somewhere else, lowered the price to $1650. I took the car to another repair shop and there was nothing wrong. The other repair shop did not even charge me and the engine light was on due to cable from rodents which they fixed for free. Don't agree with you. I would never take my car there and I think I should report this. What do you cheerleaders think?"

6900,142125650,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,4 Apr 20,"Darrell, I bet that would shine it, and that would bring some beauty back but I have another problem and that is someone burned it with cigarettes so unfortunate that people have no appreciation for anything or regard I let someone borrow it and didn‚Äôt notice until too late, it is part  of my mother‚Äôs bedroom set.i was thinking of using it in a guest bedroom. Thanks for ur hope, it probably can‚Äôt be sanded it is real wood and u can‚Äôt restore color or anything else for that matter maybe I can shine I‚Äôve it I don‚Äôt know, I was pretty mad and hurt when I found out."
6901,142125650,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,4 Apr 20,Thank u what do I buff with just a regular cloth?
6902,142125650,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,4 Apr 20,"The census was hiring as well.

6907,142125650,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,16 Apr 20,"I am hoping someone from govt will see this post. I don‚Äôt know if this has been considered but turning the convention center into a covid facility not a good idea, especially since it is used for business. I would be hesitant to use because it may not get sterilization and cleaning could just end up not being through, someone on ND said they went to a conference there and must of just touched a door knob or something and got Covid. Why does they old empty VA hospital continue to be ignored as a facility to use. Already has a lot of requirements state is spending to build and prepare when the old hospital has emergency room, kitchen area, and individual rooms set up, they just need the equipment and staff. Doesn‚Äôt make sense why this hasn‚Äôt been thought of. I have mentioned it several times for housing for the homeless I don‚Äôt really know who to voice this too, it doesn‚Äôt seem like area representatives can really or will really try to do anything much less voice it. Some of this money is not being used usefully and prudently. Who figures out the locations for city emergencies. Doesn‚Äôt seem resourceful. If anyone know who I can directly send my thoughts to on this please advise. Thanks"

6912,143770883,Clare Kelly,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,7 Apr 20,"Hello Nathaniel, you may have already done so, but please reach out to the property owners before doing a rent strike. (Sorry if I‚Äôm misunderstanding your intended meaning.) There is assistance available from the IRS and local government. A combination of help and reduced rent is far better than a rent strike. The mortgage and utilities on the property still have to be paid. So sorry you are out of work! We‚Äôre all in a tough spot! "
6913,143770883,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,7 Apr 20,"Clare, thanks for highlighting.  it's both prudent and fair to tell your landlord you wont be paying rent so they can seek assistance from the government."
6914,143770883,Jewell Fairchild,‚Ä¢ Hale,7 Apr 20,Just don't pay it.  There are no evictions right now.  What's up with all the social categorization of yourself and all these people that you think you need to help?  If you have to make a choice between rent and food.  Feed yourself.  Nobody needs social martyrs right now.  Privilege is believing that you need to be someone's savior.
6915,143770883,Russ Hathaway,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,7 Apr 20,Horrible advice. Colorado is a very strong landlord and property rights state. There are already lawyers lining  up at the courthouse doors demanding access to the courts. The governor nor the legislature has the power to close the courts. We are a co-equal tricameral government. The courts will reopen soon and evictions will be right back on the dockets.

I live in one of the buildings managed by Rio and reached out on the 1st about not being able to pay rent (am in a similar situation- a queer service industry worker) and they were pretty responsive and sent out a list of resources and were very clear that they would not be enforcing late fees, as it is against the law right now to do so. I would suggest asking for your property mangers list of resources if you haven‚Äôt already. I still have not paid and have been looking into the resources, while it is a lengthy process to apply for most, Rio has been patient and kind throughout. Hope this helps, best of luck."

6928,143770883,Anita G.,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,7 Apr 20,"I am a landlord. Wish I could just not have my tenants pay but the mortgage is still due. But there is a buffer in rent to cover anything that breaks, repairs etc. Maybe tenants for individual landlords can ask them to just pay the actual mortgage until this is over and not the buffer amount. Landlords get a bad wrap but plenty are understanding and hopefully have some wiggle room. Not too much wiggle room cause that means they are charging too much rent üòâ."
6929,143770883,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,7 Apr 20,"Anita, have you applied for any govt assistance?"

She is super neat and no pets. Her deposit is her money and not earning any interest so we gifted it back as a credit. My concern here, is that tenants don‚Äôt realize that we have a mortgage and bills to pay, not to mention Denver taxes. Not asking for sympathy, merely to educate tenants."

Banks punish small landlords with a vengeance that does not apply to the big guys. As usual, when there is massive pain, conversation and mutual empathy is more important than ‚Äúrent strikes‚Äù or other unilateral destructive actions.

Let me know if you still need anything and I'd be happy to pick it up for you.  Where were you stuck in Europe? My daughter and son-in-law barely made it out within that 6 hour window before shut down.  Self quarantined for 14 days when they got home.
6958,143020209,Steve Nelson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 Apr 20,Thanks lori i think we are good for now. We were in Paris and had a few days before they went on lock down. Then had to hunker diwn there until we made it back Monday night. People there were great

6961,143020209,Steve Nelson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 Apr 20,"Thanks Josh. I appreciate it. Hopefully, will be able to take care of myself in a few days. then i will volunteer to others . Great neighborhood"
6962,143020209,Christa Peters,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,2 Apr 20,"There are some restaurants too, like modern market and hanks bbq that are putting together grocery packages for delivery. The modern market is particularly good as it has meat and veggies (or just veggies if you don‚Äôt eat meat)."
6963,143020209,Steve Nelson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 Apr 20,Thanks much for the suggestion. Will keep in mind. Definitely eat meat.
6964,143020209,Em Wilson,‚Ä¢ Hale,2 Apr 20,"This is a perfect example of being neighborly. It warms my old ticker. The current situation is tragic, but you guys jump to help, no questions asked. Needless to say, I am very impressed & thankful. It reminds me of how everyone helped each other during a big snowstorm when I was a kid...that was MANY moons ago. Keep it up you all, maybe we can start a trend that will last AFTER this tragic time is over. It would be so nice to wave to someone & actually be acknowledged. Ahhhh, ""Those were the days."""
6965,143020209,Nancy Brauer,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 Apr 20,"King Soopers delivers. You can order online. I got mine delivered within about four days, so it takes a while, but it‚Äôs a great service"

6976,152700192,Cynthia Ivers,‚Ä¢ Lowry,24 Jun,"You are correct. Glendale doesn‚Äôt require them. If King Soopers doesn‚Äôt require it and you object, why not just shop elsewhere?"
6977,152700192,Peggy Kenney,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24 Jun,"Perhaps she has started shopping elsewhere after finding out.  I, for one, appreciate the information."
6978,152700192,Bety Ziman,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24 Jun,I didn't know that
6979,152700192,Evan Sem√≤n,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24 Jun,Why wouldn‚Äôt you wear a mask? It‚Äôs for the health of everyone.
6980,152700192,Leslie Himelspach,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24 Jun,I am also glad to know - won't be going there.
6981,152700192,Bette Rehner,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,24 Jun,"Thanks, Glad to know that. Won't be shopping there."
6982,152700192,Mark Ryan,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24 Jun,Interesting is that you found three employees wearing masks correctly...
6983,152700192,Jeff Farquhar,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,45w,"I work up in the Longmont Firestone area.  Nobody wearing masks up here.  Once people started rioting in the streets, I think most people gave up on the masks honestly.  I have been seeing huge back yard BBQ and pool parties.  Its not supposed to work unless we all wear them right?? I believe this battle has been lost.(edited)"
6984,152700192,Peter Gietl,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,25 Jun,I heard that protesting actually makes you immune /s
6985,152700192,Char Smith,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,24 Jun,"Thank you so much for sharing because I had no idea. I like to confirm information and educate myself, so I called King Soopers, Safeway, and Target corporate offices to find out what each of the policy are for each. All three of them do require their employees to wear masks due to state regulations. However, Colorado does not mandate the customers wear a mask. ‚ÄúDrawing on these orders, Amended Public Health Order 20-28 mandates that employees at businesses wear non-medical face coverings, and recommends that businesses encourage all clients, customers, or patients to do the same.‚Äù Updated 6/19/20 and copied from the ‚ÄòGuidance for Employers and Places of Public Accommodation‚Äô located on the Colorado government page: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14DNDIBBr8guROAjywtfpIxio24qbexF6xatv2t7bpRU/edit  "
6986,152700192,Kelly Hanson,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,24 Jun,"Trader Joe‚Äôs requires them, and since in the city of Denver it‚Äôs a mandate, I think more would follow. It‚Äôs interesting that they require their employees to wear them for the safety of the customers, but don‚Äôt require the same respect of customers for their employees."
6987,152700192,Char Smith,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,25 Jun,"Kelly Hanson Thank you, I often forget Traders because the location near me is on Colorado Blvd so it is somewhat of a pain to get in and out of. BUT, Natural Grocery stores also require it. Now I have a couple of options. :)"
6988,152700192,syd mal,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,24 Jun,"i think this would be better to take up with management and glendale, rather than just the employees as they can't really do much. I do agree tho, people should be wearing their masks"
6989,152700192,April Link,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24 Jun,It‚Äôs not required
6990,152700192,Erin W. Runnels,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,24 Jun,It‚Äôs the same at every store. I called the manager at Safeway off Krameria and 14th about the same thing. They can‚Äôt enforce it.
6991,152700192,Alan Davidson,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,24 Jun,"I think it‚Äôs time for everyone to stop wanting to force others to do what they think is right. If a city or county does not require masks in certain settings and others do, great! Enforcement should be LOCAL. "
6992,152700192,Brian Melodia,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24 Jun,Freedom to make other vulnerable people sick? That‚Äôs sick...
6993,152700192,Catherine Kunz,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,24 Jun,"I shopped there earlier today, only grabbed a few things from the produce department but the entrance was very clearly marked with multiple ‚Äúfacial coverings required‚Äù signs and I only saw one or two people without. You aren‚Äôt going to be able to control everyone, especially with the some of the less desirable folks that hang out there (one guy without a mask was bragging about how he‚Äôs finally quit smoking after a month in jail...), and you‚Äôll probably drive yourself nuts if you try."
6994,152700192,Phoenix Wren Paasch,‚Ä¢ Hale,24 Jun,"Considering I just watched a video of this elderly guy literally shoving and pushing a Walmart employee in Florida who was telling him he couldn't go in without a mask, I can hardly blame the employees. Retail is a terrible job. Try and tell a lady with a purse dog that she can't bring in the purse dog and she'll flip a lid on you; I can only imagine how much worse it is trying to enforce masks. I wish more cities would be the ones to say ""masks required inside"" like Denver does because that at least takes SOME burden off the employees.  Either way I'm grateful I don't work retail anymore."
6995,152700192,Scott Johnson,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,24 Jun,"Maybe shop elsewhere, just a thought"
6996,152700192,Cindy Gioffredi,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,24 Jun,AMEN
6997,152700192,Art Maniatis,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,24 Jun,"King Soopers on Leetsdale is Arapahoe County, not Denver.  Denver is the only county that is requiring them at this point"
6998,152700192,Art Maniatis,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,24 Jun,John Mink only the northeast corner is Denver. The rest is Arapahoe
6999,152700192,Cindy Gioffredi,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,24 Jun,Parts of Glendale are in BOTH Arapahoe & Denver county. Google it. & WHY is this relevant???
7000,152700192,Summer G.,‚Ä¢ Bonnie Brae,24 Jun,I was at the King Soopers on University and Hampden today multiple people were not wearing masks.
7001,152700192,Cynthia Ivers,‚Ä¢ Lowry,24 Jun,Is that Denver or Arapahoe County?
7002,152700192,Nicole Schwartz,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,24 Jun,Denver
7003,152700192,Joan Baronberg,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24 Jun,"Isn't it about time people stop complaining about everything? When I shop at Spers Leetsdale, I feel grateful for how nicely they keep up the store, how kind and helpful is almost every employee, and that I have access to so much fresh produce. Can't we spend more time thanking workers and management and being aware how things continue to work well more or less. The ""victim"" and blaming mentality has been overdone."
7004,152700192,Susan Taylor-Erdos,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,24 Jun,AMEN Joan!!
7005,152700192,April Link,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24 Jun,A great alternative is grocery delivery.  It‚Äôs the greatest thing since sliced bread.
7006,152700192,Cynthia Ivers,‚Ä¢ Lowry,24 Jun,Absolutely agree!
7007,152700192,Carrie Stiles,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,24 Jun,"Bety, fair observations and questions.  I‚Äôm glad you asked them.   A dear friend who was otherwise healthy, died of covid 19, while coming back from a jog.  He was asymptomatic and only 56.  A kind, intelligent person.  I am happy to wear a mask to protect myself, my family and others.  Virtual funeral is this Sun.  Stay well."

7029,135111505,Andrew Korson,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,23 Jan 20,Gardner has a history of painting constituent calls as ‚Äúoutside interests‚Äù interfering with Colorado business. This was based on the mistaken assumption that out of state numbers are not constituents. I have a 503 area code and live in 80209. I inform him of this whenever I call.

7040,135111505,Brent Valente,‚Ä¢ Hale,23 Jan 20,If this is what can be considered a political post then so to is every one about housing issues and zoning of 5 story buildings in a residential area. Can we start taking those down too?
7041,135111505,Julia Bristor,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,24 Jan 20,Fact based discussion on reaching our pols is not politics.  They‚Äôre the politicians and work for us.  We are their constituents and in a democracy we have every right to expect them to reply to us.
7042,135111505,Jack Bath,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,23 Jan 20,Give it a rest. Not a political platform here. Grow up
7043,135111505,Julie Hummel,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,23 Jan 20,Grow up???? What a shocking response---really??? Our republic is not about being a grown up?? You may not like to see this and that's fine but grow up?? How old are you??
7044,135111505,Kelli Lewis,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,23 Jan 20,"Sandra, Trying to find an effective avenue to reach elected representatives is only political due to the category.  It is not expressing a view.  You trying to suppress the asking of the question is inappropriate, honestly."
7045,135111505,Eric Novikoff,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,23 Jan 20,"I agree.  In particular, local issues such as schools and roads and garbage and policing always have a political dimension.  Often times, organizing to fix something even without politicians involved still requires coordinating with them.  All of us care about Denver, and about Colorado.  We can support each other in that caring regardless of party.   I haven't seen much ""politics"" in this thread other than people trying to help each other out to get in contact with their representative."

7071,146063663,Stephanie Seller,‚Ä¢ Glendale,30 Apr 20,Drive thru at Leetsdale store. Upon arrival - stay in the car and pop the trunk. GW managed to keep employees working (out of the unemployment line) . . . If only my employer was that committed.

7074,146063663,Hannatu H.,‚Ä¢ Hale,27 Apr 20,Excellent idea.
7075,146063663,Jan Holland-Beachley,‚Ä¢ Lowry,26 Apr 20,Meredith- what kinds of things do they take?
7076,146063663,Meredith Gabow,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,26 Apr 20,"Everything.  Nothing gets wasted.  My mom just passed and I donated medical ( walker, first aid, etc) soft goods ( clothing, linens, feather bed) household items ( drip leaf table, bookcases, coffee table, )  office supplies, electronics, food and sbacks ... they are sooooo cool and kind.  My go- to organization. Some things by appointment because this is theur warehouse and I think they have classes there."
7077,146063663,Linda Keller,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,26 Apr 20,Where can we make a drop off? The one on 6th and Clayton is closed.

I only paid $29.99 for 50!  They are 84 x 52 inches and received almost a 5 star rating.  Hunters and campers tested them out and gave rave reviews.  They claim to retain 90% of body heat.  I am not posting this information for kudos, only to provide details if others are interested.  Thank you Barb for your awesome work on behalf of our homeless.  (PS - I kept a few of the Mylar Blankets for myself and family and friends.)  Happy Holidays!  Kammy"

7105,141153671,Ann Burke,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,20 Mar 20,What an amazing idea. I wish I was a landlord. Anyone have an empty apartment or house?
7106,141153671,Ann Burke,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,20 Mar 20,"Also, if you have an empty commercial property, that could potentially help."
7107,141153671,Kane Cagnina,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,20 Mar 20,A DU student told me that the dorms were going to be used for quarantine if necessary. Maybe this is something to look into. Best of luck and a big thanks to everyone helping out.

I took a pair of boots to Dardano‚Äôs that needed more extensive work and they sent me to The Custom House. Lovely small business that did excellent work (and they also do tailoring). I highly recommend them.
7166,129694949,Tracey D.,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,15 Nov 19,Same experience too....They are lovely at The Custom House. (& very nice of Dardano‚Äôs to recommend them).

7169,132295067,Katie Mattson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,1y,"He said, ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs something in the mailbox.‚Äù Makes me think he was on a headset and part of a ring(edited)"

7171,132295067,Jd Erickson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,16 Dec 19,Guess we can no longer have packages left at our doors.
7172,132295067,Katie Mattson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,1y,Totally. I‚Äôm usually home and catch it. But this guy was brazen enough to ring the bell and walk across my entire lawn. It just makes you feel violated.(edited)

7174,132295067,Lontine Chavez,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,16 Dec 19,just had a delivery from Amazon and they instantly notified me and emailed photo of package on my doorstep .. went out and all good ..
7175,132295067,Katie Mattson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,17 Dec 19,I can usually do the same as I‚Äôm usually home. I had run by the house in between errands bc I got a notification 30 minutes before this of another package. But I was further than 12 minutes away when I got the next notification of another delivery.
7176,132295067,Masoud Kholghy,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,16 Dec 19,"Points for the movie reference.  I've chased people away while walking my dog in the neighborhood.   They get defensive, as if I'm taking something away from them, or it's their right to steal.  I'm actually afraid of violence with these people.  They are amateur and brazen, and will do stupid things. Be careful."
7177,132295067,Katie Mattson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,16 Dec 19,"Yes, you do the same. The sense of entitlement is ludicrous. Thanks for getting my humor!"
7178,132295067,Mlis Ward,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,17 Dec 19,Amazon now has delivery lockers. There is one at the 7/11 on 8th and Colorado. Consider shipping your purchases there to put these Porch Pirates out of business. They just follow the Amazon van around. Easy pickings.
7179,132295067,Katie Mattson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,17 Dec 19,"Yep, I was just telling my mom this will be my new delivery address for Amazon. It‚Äôs just sad and annoying that I have to be inconvenienced bc of some strangers sense of entitlement."

7184,132295067,Katie Mattson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,17 Dec 19,It was probably stolen the day before. If anyone gets footage of him in a green ‚ÄúPaddy‚Äôs Pub‚Äù tshirt you know where it came from
7185,132295067,Eric Isbell,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,17 Dec 19,If you have a dog or a cat you can start filling used amazon boxes with a nice surprise and leave them out there. May not stop the problem but at least a little revenge.

7189,132295067,Sandi Heller,‚Ä¢ Hale,17 Dec 19,Does anyone get caught and packages returned using this Ring?
7190,132295067,Chris Simpson,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,17 Dec 19,The police will not go after them most of the time...
7191,132295067,Ione Hartley,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,17 Dec 19,Did you know you can have things delivered to a lockbox 
7192,132295067,Stacy Oh,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,17 Dec 19,"And whole foods, but who wants to fight the traffic in that parking lot!"
7193,132295067,Katie Mattson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,17 Dec 19,"Yeah, this won‚Äôt happen again. Fool me once..."
7194,132295067,Amy Morris,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,17 Dec 19,My daughter has a shovel on her front porch and lately amazon guy has been placing (smallish) packages behind it- at least it‚Äôs a little more discreet. Otherwise the lockers are a great way to go.

7196,132295067,Geysu Gurpinar,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,17 Dec 19,"Unbelievable, lately these thieves look right to the camera and don't even care. I think best is neighbors helping each other like offered by one of our CC neighbors. Maybe if we reduce or completely eliminate packages at the doors, thieves will give up and go somewhere else."
7197,132295067,Katie Mattson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,17 Dec 19,"Agreed. That‚Äôs why they get away with it and look directly into the camera whilst ringing the bell, bc there‚Äôs no consequence. To be honest, I‚Äôve only had one Denver officer ever help me with issues around my property. When I had a homeless man defalcating in my YARD in front of my child I went to the station to report it. They literally told me that I needed to take a photo of him in the act next time for evidence! Umm, the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù was still sitting in my yard! And what‚Äôs worse is the SAME guy has stood at the corner every day since for YEARS and at the end of the day, he gets into his car parked at Anthony‚Äôs and goes home! (Not homeless!) I know this bc he told an officer that he commutes from Aurora bc it‚Äôs lucrative in our neighborhood (and I‚Äôve seen him get into the car!)"
7198,132295067,Sandi Heller,‚Ä¢ Hale,17 Dec 19,Katie Mattson The police really should try to go after these people if they‚Äôre pawning this stuff to pay for a meth lab or other illicit crap. Imagine a little detective work helping citizens?
7199,132295067,Katie Mattson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,1y,"I feel like they are so restricted with what they can do now (30 day eviction notice if someone moves in under a tree on the parkway), that the vagrants just run free.(edited)"
7200,132295067,Sonja Knight,‚Ä¢ Lowry,17 Dec 19,Amazon refunded my package that was stolen last week.  (Amazon rocks!)
7201,132295067,Katie Mattson,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,17 Dec 19,"Oh really?? Thank you, I will try that! This is my first experience so I didn‚Äôt know they‚Äôd do that!"
7202,126868441,Karin Schumacher,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Oct 19,"The Gathering Place is a daytime shelter for homeless and transitioning women - and I'm sure they would love the toiletries.  Their office is on Colfax Avenue.  Google for address and hone number.   the other possibility is Project Worthmore, a refugee resource center, in Aurora on 17th avenue.   Thanks for donating."
7203,126868441,Julie Spaeth,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,15 Oct 19,"The Samaritan House at 23rd and Lawrence ...  or we could take them down,,,,"
7204,126868441,Julie Spaeth,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,15 Oct 19,"Nextdoor is not for airing personal comments and slander.    Someone made an honest offer and  I work with the homeless and  appreciate all donations, toiletries included."
7205,126868441,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,16 Oct 19,"There must be some comments missing because I don‚Äôt see anything ‚Äúslanderous.‚Äù Btw, it would be libel not slander. Regardless, I have done work with the homeless (United Way) and I have heard something similar as Kathy‚Äôs sentiment. People have gotten so sensitive to hearing an opposing opinion they take it as a personal attack. It‚Äôs simply another perspective."

7207,126868441,Julia Gunter,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,16 Oct 19,"I, for one, approve of recycling in any form. There are many reasons someone might donate partially used items.... moving for example. If I couldn't afford to buy toiletries I would appreciate a nice bottle of shampoo even if it were not completely full. I think it's very nice of you, Ingrid, to think of others. I wish I knew of a place you could donate toiletries that someone might want... I also don't understand why Kathy would attack you and say your good intentions are ""degrading"", and that ""no one wants leftovers""."
7208,126868441,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,21 Oct 19,"Excuse me if you couldn‚Äôt accept an honest answer I was not the only one who felt the way I did, but was the only one who had nerve enough to express it. For those of you who were offended and called me rude and ignorant were not exactly on the right side to express their feelings to me in such a way were very rude too. So I have learned that some of my neighbors don‚Äôt receive my comments in as such in conversation and take things very personal.. if I wanted to do something I would not care what others say because I would feel good doing it"
7209,126868441,Anne Filler,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,16 Oct 19,I think it‚Äôs awesome that you want to donate items! I‚Äôm sorry that people have been so ignorant and rude to you! 
7210,126868441,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,16 Oct 19,A place I volunteered would not accept used products due to tampering issues.
7211,126868441,Anne Filler,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,16 Oct 19,I definitely understand the tampering issue. I wondered about that myself. I just can‚Äôt believe someone trying to do a nice thing would be spoken to the way Ingrid was.
7212,126868441,Aj Stack,‚Ä¢ Central Park,16 Oct 19,I love when people give me toiletries that they no longer use or like. And why be wasteful if someone else will use and enjoy?
7213,126868441,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,21 Oct 19,You are absolutely right.
7214,126868441,Lisa H.,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,22 Oct 19,"You guys are funny, anybody notice ingrid didnt even respond?kathy so aggressive!"
7215,126868441,Ingrid Z.,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,22 Oct 19,"I did respond but it was in response to Jane, whose comments were removed. I appreciate the suggestions."
7216,126868441,Dorothy Todd,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,22 Oct 19,"I often pick up the small bottles from my motel room when I travel.  I've dropped off small bottles of shampoo, conditioner (great for shaving legs!), lotion, and small soaps at The Gathering Place. I've done the same with extra travel size toothpaste and floss from my dentist.   They seem very appreciative."
7217,126868441,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,22 Oct 19,"Now that‚Äôs very thoughtful, and they aren‚Äôt used, when in Israel my girlfriend would take the shampoo and shower gel to give to homeless at home US."
7218,126868441,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,7 Nov 19,"Since you had several digested places to donate , which place did you donate to? Who was willing to take ur used toiletries?"
7219,126868441,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,9 Nov 19,"Why is it everyone brushes everything under the rug and all I ask was where w the items donated, and I‚Äôm aggressive, some of these remarks are pathetic and beyond my understanding of why people are so submissive to anything. I ask a simple question, I even made a suggestion for donation, just wanted to know where she took them, since she was so sincere about giving them away, such a big deal the whole thing. You should be curious about the outcome as well, where were they taken or where they even accepted?"
7220,126868441,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,9 Nov 19,"I have found out what petty neighbors I have website not what is intended or meant to be I‚Äôm sure, why can‚Äôt people just be positive when making a remark with the bullying and pointed finger, all so childish. I was told these very things yet they r being used by others. So hypocritical."

7236,140415181,Widicker Ava,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Mar 20,"I was feeling like a broken record saying ""this isn't the flu.""  This is a virus - wash your hands, sing Happy Birthday - under the rings scrub - social distancing - get your sleep - it will pass.  The Spanish Flu died out - this will too.  But the best way you can help the medical people is social distancing so you don't get sick & we don't have to take care of you.  It works.  It sucks to cancel vacations as I did - I was to be on a beach today.  Now I will probably work on my vacation."

7247,122730087,Nancy Bartlett,‚Ä¢ Country Club,3 Sep 19,"Waste Management will pick up mattresses on Extra Trash day.  Those go to the landfill.

7249,122730087,Carol Altvater,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,4 Sep 19,I‚Äôve seen trucks in the neighborhood from a mattress recycling company. I don‚Äôt know the name but I‚Äôd bet you can google it.  Way better then the landfill.

7257,122730087,Cat S.,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,1y,"If your building has a dumpster, you don't likely have city trash and may need to pick a neighbor's address on large item pick up day. Leaving it by a dumpster will likely incur additional fees from your trash pickup company, if they're equipped to pick it up same-day at all. Here's Denver's large item pickup schedule: https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/trash-and-recycling/trash-collection/ETC.html(edited)"

7259,122730087,Kama Newell,‚Ä¢ City Park,5 Sep 19,"You can schedule a pick up with Spring Back Colorado Mattress recycling. I think it's $20 per mattress. They will come to you to pick up the mattress. They actually break down the mattress into parts and repurpose them. https://www.springbackco.org/ Definitely the more environmentally friendly way to go. I have seen Denver's large pick up days and they literally throw the furniture into a trash truck and grind it up. The items end up in pieces in the landfill. Great way to get rid of them, but not very environmentally friendly."
