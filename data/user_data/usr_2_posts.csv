I was  literally floored and became sick to my stomach once I heard the news that 
Was just presented to me by a friend.  Honestly  I can’t see how this location would be considered an appropriate location for housing homeless population.  This was apparently approved “under the radar” and was in the works without many knowing about it!  Question:  Who is going to police this and keep our children’s safety top priority? Who is going to keep the area sanitized and clean of debris that we already see all over the city where these tent cities currently exist?  Not to mention our property values will likely diminish as a result of this horrible decision.. I am all for finding an appropriate location to house our homeless population, but as a tax payer it would have been nice to have had a say in the decision, but instead it was pushed through under the radar!  I mean really, smack dab in the middle of our established neighborhood that is literally a block from our public library and grade school? This is the “Wrong” location and the “Wrong” decision by our state and local authorities.  Ultimately This will present a major safety issue for our neighbors  and our children, and is a very very bad thing for North Parkhill overall..  Something needs to be done to stop this atrocity!

It’s overwhelming to consider the scope and scale of environmental degradation experienced even in our lifetime, but doing even the tiniest bit makes a difference. Sure, picking up a few pieces of litter might seem nearly inconsequential when you think about the big picture. But here’s the thing—it feels tangible. Immediate. And you know what else? It feels GOOD!  I hope seeing me out there can inspire others to perhaps give back as well. To care. And ultimately, to feel just a little less overwhelmed.

Sop if you need a laundromat to wash your own laundry, give them a try.  Yovonne was very helpful (besides being stylish) and courteous.  I swear the photo had her face in it.

Then I had 3 huge bags for St. Francis Center and 2 for Samaritan House which I delivered yesterday.  There were lots of jeans and blankets, real treasures to the shelters.

Many thanks to those who donated clothing and laundry supplies.  I have since received 2 more donations, so I may stop raiding the homeless camps and jeopardizing my health.

The city’s Emergency Operations Center was activated yesterday and continues to monitor the storm and its impacts. Make sure to stay home, stay safe, and stay prepared. 

➡️ In case of a power outage, make sure to charge your phone and have extra batteries on hand.
➡️ Don’t drive if you don’t have to.
➡️ Wet, heavy snow can weigh down tree branches and cause them to break. Check to make sure the tree is safe and clear of all utility lines before removing snow.
➡️ Stay clear of downed lines and report them immediately to Xcel Energy at 1-800-895-1999.
➡️ Make sure your sidewalks are free and clear of ice and snow and lend a helping hand to neighbors who need help shoveling! 
➡️ Many sheltering beds remain open & available to receive guests from the storm. First responders & street outreach teams continue to connect with people experiencing homelessness, providing referrals and transportation to emergency shelters. More details at denvergov.org/emergencyshelter
➡️ Don’t leave your pets outside. If the weather is too bad for you and your family, it’s also not safe for your pets.

20,183906949,Jim Hannifin,South Park Hill,6 days ago,"Regarding PHUMC Safe Outdoor Space. Some people might presume that many of the people who are out on the streets are there because they were criminals, pedophiles, addicts - or at least maybe anti-social, and based on that might oppose a fenced Safe Outdoor Space tent village in our neighborhood. Of course! Mostly they’re pretty regular folks, though, it turns out.

Our nation used to have a different economic and social framework than we have today. One of the social support structures that our forebears had were their Churches. God bless PHUMC for stepping up to re-take that role.  So far, churches have been the only landowners to offer usable land for Safe Outdoor Spaces to move people off the street curbs.

Regarding S.O.S.s: The difference between the improvement of moving from an apartment into your first house does not remotely compare to the improvement of moving from a tent on a city street-curb, into a tent within a fenced-in enclosure of a church parking lot with san-o-lets, trash service, social structure, electricity, and no fear of having your base “swept” away by city cleaning crews any random day. An S.O.S is still minimal, but is a haven of peace to people who need a haven of peace. 

A precedent: The S.O.S. in the church lot on 16th and Pearl was already built before they decided that they were going to invite everyone from what I saw as the wild filthy crazy “un-sanctioned” camp across the street, to move into the new S.O.S. It’s what I think a Jesus would have done, but still I expected disaster. (And I was one of the volunteers!) Yet when I visited it two weeks later, and multiple times since, it is a Haven of Peace. There are one or two bright bold larger than life characters, but there is peace and security, and there is healing and grace. It is managed by a firm and loving staff and appreciated by grateful campers.

I do not think the larger neighborhood will be impacted for the worse by this camp. (Note there are background checks because of the nearby day-care, too.) I hope they will be surprised to find that the lot has been transformed into something more humanely beautiful and somehow more tranquil than a barren asphalt lot. And it is only for six months.

Kids can still play. Children have agile perception. Teach kids to be wary, but not afraid. That’s how I grew up and I feel my life is richer, for it.

These people who will stay in an S.O.S. aren’t the dregs that a “worst-case” mindset imagines; and we need to do something better than what has been done until now for our fellow humans.  I am proud of this church, and of Park Hill, for stepping up, and I hope that we can crow to the rest of the city: This is what Park Hill does, and you can, too.

(And if it turns out it isn’t “all that”, we can adjust things!)"

22,180920051,Laura Avant,Northeast Park Hill,21 Mar,"Save me from myself! I am absolutely not proud about getting good warm clothing to the homeless.  I have been known to raid abandoned homeless camps for clothing to take home to wash and dry and donate to the shelters.  But these last two weeks really took the honors for OCD clothes gathering.  I was down at St. Francis Center giving out  handmade hats and scarves from Knitting for Peace when I noticed a lot of clothing on the ground, in the gutter, and under snow and trash.  I did as an OCD social worker would do and picked them up, put them in my car and took them home.  The items I got last week were washed and dried, folded and sorted and taken to the two shelters I donate to.  
Then Friday I did the same thing again but intended to get it all back to the people there before the snow started and give it directly to them.  I didn't make my own deadline so the two bags are still here while a sleeping bag hangs over the shower curtain.

I would so much rather deal with the nice, clean stylish and warm donations that this community has been offering me, but my donations have dried up lately.  If you can save me from this ridiculous practice of resurrecting dirty abandoned clothing by donating, please do.    I am attaching photos of the latest OCD bags ready to be washed.  

One of the reasons for the unending need for clothing is that COVID has halted the laundry trucks that used to make stops at various homeless areas for people to hand in dirty clothes to be washed and dried and returned to them.  Now when things get dirty or wet, they have no recourse for washing them.  I certainly can't afford the laundry products, hot water, and gas to go down town all the time on my social security, but I would gladly  take cash donations so I can continue to ""resurrect"" these things.  Then I could go to a big laundromat and wash a lot at once.  As with your donations, you may PM me, email me or call at 303-316-6748 to arrange for delivery or pick up.

On the other hand, take a look through your closet and drawers to find clothing or household items to donate (Samaritan House gives household items to families leaving the shelter.) and let me know.  I'll get my OCD self to your place or welcome you here."

Volunteers cleaned up the area in front and across the street from the liquor store, and we must have picked up 30 empty shot or 1/5 bottles.  This morning there was just as many empty bottles.  I noticed the store opens at 8:00 each day, and customers are pouring in there, and some are throwing out empty bottles almost immediately.

The question I have is should businesses that contributes to homeless, alcoholism, and an unsavory environment be allowed to stay open.  I'm going to lobby the city council to change the zoning rules for the Art's District.  

I may start a petition to garner support and show city council this is important.

Might you have any winter clothing items? Jackets, gloves, sweaters, etc.  that you could give to either in person to those out in the elements? IDEAS: Put together a small bag of items and hand them through your window or donate cash in an envelope (virus concerns). Dog/cat food for those with pets is wonderful too.  Small food bags of bottled water and granola bars are great as well.

The Denver City Council will hold a public hearing and vote next week on the final proposal to modernize rules that govern residential uses in the Denver Zoning Code. The proposed text amendment package would give residents more housing options and providers more flexibility to address the needs of vulnerable communities. It also fixes outdated and confusing language, and addresses long-standing equity gaps in the city's zoning code. The final proposal is the result of three years of work and reflects thoughtful compromise from all sides after months of thorough review by the public, the Denver Planning Board and council members.

57,182974733,Deb Miller,Hilltop,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"About the opening question..... I am struggling to clearly say Why I think of homelessness as an important issue. 
Maybe cuz I have always thought people without housing are just as good as anyone, as me or cuz I was homeless for a few months.  I am not sure. I just do. 

I have volunteered, mostly at the Network Coffeehouse when John Hicks was alive, a small program connected to the then Legal Center for People with Disabilities, but they changed their name to Disability Law Colorado. 

I hope you all are ok with my answer."

I have successfully completed a big and emotionally exhausting project. I was out all day last Friday and was able to distribute these items and lend a helping hand to a few cold folks. 
THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE DONATIONS FROM MY AMAZING NEIGHBORS!! With the money I purchased dozens of emergency blankets and received clothing donations like gloves, hats, blankets, as well as some hot tea containers which I filled up and gave out. 

 Jay blanket and gloves 

Mercedes blanket and tampons and a ride to a friends place

3 emergency blankets to 3 tentless friends sleeping on the sidewalk

A few dozen emergency blankets to tent camps

A donated coffee to a man who was sleeping on the corner 

Harrison - ride to the shelter, emergency blankets and a friend to talk to through the process of sobriety

Emergency sleeping bag for a man who didn’t want to go to the shelter and was on the sidewalk in -2 degree weather

Gloves and blanket to Priest (that’s his name) 

Thank you and I look forward to continuing this in my day to day life. Warmer weather to come. Thank you all for your kind spirits and genuine desire to help."

64,181569351,Laura Avant,Northeast Park Hill,27 Mar,"Laundry for the homeless Monday morning, 3/29. I just raided a homeless encampment again on Friday to gather clothing to sort and wash.  Almost no one was there, but there were piles of trash everywhere, so I sifted through (sanitized my hands afterward) and found a lot of useful clothing that was simply dirty or wet or both.   I took it home and have dried out all that is useful and bagged it to be washed and dried.

How would you like to help do the laundry? The laundromat at 20th and Clarkson  (Suds?) will let us do the laundry for free on Monday morning. Carolyn just brought two big containers of detergent, so your labor and maybe some Shout or dryer sheets would help a lot. I plan to be there at about 9:30 with four big bags (soon to be 5) to wash. One young lady who lives near and needs some clothes said she would come help in exchange for clothing and I have one more saint who may come help. 

If you can help, please call me at 303-316-6748 and let me know.  Here are some photos of step 1: drying everything out and step 2: sorting and bagging.  Now it is time for Step 3: Washing and drying.  How about a Step 4 where we meet for coffee before driving home?  It would be a real pleasure to meet any one with enough chutzpah to wash clothing for homeless people who are so often insulted and sold short.  They will be taken to Samaritan House and St. Francis Center within two days of getting them clean.  

For those of us who believe that even homeless people prefer to have clean clothing to wear when they can find it and who try to provide it for free, here is a last desperate step taken by an old social worker.  St. Francis Center gives out clothing on Wednesday and Friday afternoons.  Samaritan House likes to give it to their residents in 4 programs including a family section, but they will give anyone what you need if you go to the door and ask.  

Please put your commitment into real hard action and come help."

68,172797351,Lisa Cherry,South Park Hill,5 Jan,"Suspicious Vehicle - White Box Truck. parked between Magnolia and Niagara Street on 22nd. 

It was parked outside of our house on 12/21/20 for ~48 hours with a woman in the passenger seat. She did not leave the vehicle the entire time. I witnessed her smoking a pipe and dumping liquids outside the vehicle. When my husband approached the vehicle to check on her she shoed him away. Eventually, we called the non emergency police line to report a suspicious vehicle. When the police arrived we heard them state the woman had a warrant for her arrest, followed by them handcuffing her, and taking her away in their police vehicle. Shortly after (~30mins), the police returned with the woman and she remained in the vehicle until next morning when we woke and the vehicle was gone.

Then today when we woke, 1/5/20, the vehicle was parked on the side of our house with the same woman in the passenger seat.

It is a white chevy box truck. The license plate is AZL Q21. I just wanted to reach out to the ND community to see if there have been similar sightings or if anyone has more information.

132,171678069,Karen Kaiser,East Colfax,23 Dec,"Happy Holidays. T'was a month before Christmas,
And all through the town,
People wore masks,
That covered their frown.

The frown had begun
Way back in the Spring,
When a global pandemic
Changed everything.

They called it corona,
But unlike the beer,
It didn’t bring good times,
It didn’t bring cheer.

Airplanes were grounded,
Travel was banned.
Borders were closed
Across air, sea and land.

As the world entered lockdown
To flatten the curve,
The economy halted,
And folks lost their nerve.

From March to July
We rode the first wave,
People stayed home,
They tried to behave.

When summer emerged
The lockdown was lifted.
But away from caution,
Many folks drifted.

Now it’s December
And cases are spiking,
Wave two has arrived,
Much to our disliking.

It’s true that this year
Has had sadness a plenty,
We’ll never forget
The year 2020.

And just ‘round the corner -
The holiday season,
But why be merry?
Is there even one reason?

To decorate the house
And put up the tree,
Who will see it,
No one but me.

But outside my window
The snow gently falls,
And I think to myself,
Let’s deck the halls!

So, I gather the ribbon,
The garland and bows,
As I play those old carols,
My happiness grows."

Helms describes the meaning of the transgender pride flag as follows:

I’ve noticed since moving to Denver 3 years ago that many people and neighbors post about “found” cats, friendly cats in their yard, or cats that seem well kept without collars roaming around looking for attention. It truly has piqued my curiosity as this is a very common thing, having outdoor, free roaming pet cats, with or without collars where I’m from. 
I want to state that my own two cats are indoor only, but I never really have too much concern for the neighborhood friendly, well kept pet cats that roam around the houses, and seem to just seek some petting. We have several that stop by our home for attention and move on to the next house. Having one that is in actual distress is another matter of course.

I'm not going to shy away from the fact that I chose to pay some bills before I bought my drugs and if they don't want to do anything but  blow it all away that's fine but that's a very serious issue that needs to be made aware of and you know the problem will never go away if they are not going to be held accountable for their actions and decisions that they chose to make in the aspect of the homeless community that have had this opportunity for a chance at doing something different than continuing to be a part of the problem as a victim we understand is crap and the only reason we don't have the opportunity for the people to do what they are going around and raging out crying out and being the most important person who was their own individual self oppressed stuck in this situation and NOT you who help continually or anyone else but that individual.  I need you to understand that  only  maybe  half the community or something is being the way of the homeless community never getting the chance they are crying out for and persecuting people who have no role in the decision that person made when they got 7 to 12000 dollars back pay  and then chose to  blow it off with drugs and alcohol and their  whatever other choices. I'm open for you and I to get an interview with each other set and you and I have a lot of questions about time together to make an impact in our understanding of what is going to need to be implemented by us experienced in our own way and we have a very strong and positive attitude towards this standard strategy for the future innovation of all of us getting to the point of being the good and correct stew.

I was talking to a cashier at the new Sprouts because it is apparently deader than a door nail everyday in the evening. One of the craziest phenoms about living in this community is that restaurants and bars struggle because everything goes completely silent once the sun goes down.  

Why does this happen?  Is it because there are so many young families with small children?  Are people afraid to go out and about at night for safety reasons?

163,174505491,Kathleen Hatsell,Central Park,21 Jan,"Husky mix available to adopt. We are fostering this beautiful gem for Red Fern rescue.

Husky Mix, approximately 77 pounds. He really will be your best Buddy. Buddy ended up in rescue because his owner of 10 years developed health problems and could no longer care for him.

He is smart, a fast learner, easy to have in the house and a pleasure to take on walks. He loves nothing more than laying down and having his belly rubbed. He will visit to put his head on your lap for some pets but isn’t offended if you don’t have time just then. Stays off the furniture, alerts when he needs to go potty (stand by the door).  

He seems perhaps a bit fixated on cats and may do best in a house without them- but has been fantastic with other dogs.  Due to his size, it would be probably best not to be with young kids, but older is fine (our kids are teenagers). 

When he goes on walks, we use a gentle leader and he stays right by our side unless we extend the leash and let him roam. He doesn’t react to bikers, people, cars, or other dogs (even when they lunge at him) he turns his head curiously but keeps on walking. He is simply the best dog to walk, so easy.

Don’t miss out on this amazing dog. He is a love and is very fit and spry for his 10 years. He looks like a much younger dog. He loves a nice walk but is calm and mellow in the house. He clearly came from a good home  and deserves a new home that loves and appreciates this handsome gem. He deserves the best of homes!"

The question I have is should businesses that contributes to homeless, alcoholism, and an unsavory environment be allowed to stay open.  I'm going to lobby the city council to change the zoning rules for the Art's District.  

I may start a petition to garner support and show city council this is important.

Have a great day.  Chris"

Last night we had an intruder inside our house just before 1am. We are on Nome near Montview.

The dog started barking and it seems we didn’t properly latch the back door. My partner called out and she identified herself. She had a large bag with her and asked to stay for a bit because she was tired from traveling. She was agreeable to leaving, but asked several more times if she could stay. 

I don’t think she had any malicious intent (nothing was taken or damaged), just looking for a warm place to hang out. 

Nothing bad happened and she was agreeable to moving along, but just a reminder to double check that your doors are locked at night!"

181,169919213,Vanessa Marlyn V Watkins,Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Dec,"My thoughts exactly! If you don't agree keep scrolling 🤷‍♀️. In the next 4-8 weeks, you'll all be seeing the ""We need to re-home our pet..."" posts. These are the people who went ahead and purchased puppies, kittens, rabbits...etc. as Christmas gifts who are suddenly allergic, moving, having a baby, don't have time, their kids won't take care of it, didn't think they'd get so big, didn't think they shed, didn't think they needed food....

Problem is, 90% of unwanted pets end up in kill shelters. 

Allow me to break it down for you. 

You didn't know you had an allergy? Oops. Don't let the pet suffer, buy some allergy medicine. 

You're moving? What city are you moving to that doesn't allow dogs? Bullshitville? You have a responsibility to your living, breathing family member to plan ahead to find a house, apartment or condo that will ALLOW your family member. Period. I would be HOMELESS with my pet before giving them up.

Oh, you had no idea you were due to have a baby in 2 months? Didn't know that's how it worked.. Get a dog trainer and remember that the pet was your child first. 

Don't have time to let a dog out, or to have a dog just sit next to you while you're home? Really? So they're better off in a shelter than waiting in your house for you to get home? Ok, perhaps get another pet to keep them company or look for a local dog-sitter. 

Oh, you mean your five-year-old didn't step up to the plate to feed, walk and scoop poop like they promised? I guess it's time for YOU to step up and role model for your child.

Wrong size? Not cute as an adult? Sheds too much? Barks? Breathes? Not quite the personality you expected? Look in a mirror, how did you turn out? Should we send you back? 😡 

Guess what? If the roles were reversed, your dog would NEVER LET YOU GO.

185,162206217,Jude Wolf,South Park Hill,22 Sep,"Vote to end breed specific legislation. **update: remember to vote and do your own research rather than listening to biased comments in this discussion. We can not punish innocent dogs and responsible owners by keeping a ban that is proven to be ineffective! 🐶💕

Vote YES on 2J this November to end Denver’s ban on pit bulls and implement dog laws that focus on responsible dog ownership!

Why?
Breed specific legislation doesn’t make cities safer. Breed isn’t an indicator of whether or not a dog will bite- responsible ownership is. It is proven that pit bulls are not disproportionately dangerous compared to other dogs. Enforcing Denver’s ban on pit bulls has cost the city over $5.8 million. Denver already has rules in place about animal attacks, bites, and dangerous animals. Overall it is discriminatory against responsible owners and their dogs. Thousands of family dogs have been euthanized because of this ban.

If you are interested in learning more, watch Beyond the Myth on amazon prime or reach out for more resources!

New legislation:
1. All pit bulls will be required to be microchipped.

2. All pit bulls will be required to be spayed or neutered. 

3. Only two pit bulls will be allowed per home.

4. Owners will be required to notify animal control if their dog escapes.

5. If after three years there are no issues, the pup will qualify for a standard dog license."

203,169420824,Timothy Carter,Hale,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"Lawsuit Proceedings. On December 15th and 16th, 2020, Federal District 10 Judge Martinez will be hearing our case against the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for violating constitutional rights by sweeping people without homes and with nowhere to go - even in a global pandemic. This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housing - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, “The CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.” 

On top of this the suit addresses that, “Over the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (“to where?” is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).” The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can’t afford housing during this pandemic. 

Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that “when I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.” Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time. 

Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. There will be a call-in number where the public can listen to the hearing. Stay tuned for this number. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to the hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place.

I was walking my dog along Lowry Blvd heading south when a Red (presumably) Chrysler 300 or similar vehicle slowed down near where we were walking and then stopped against the curb next to where we were on the grass. I immediately moved away from the grass and sidewalk and walked a small path into my apartment complex/community area between buildings, to which then the car sped up and made the next right turn into the complex. I quickly entered my neighboring building and viewed the car slowly drive around the parking lot, make some stops within the lot, and then leave the complex.
They very well could’ve been lost or meeting up with someone, but the behavior and movement of the car gave me a bad feeling. As a young woman who is used to big city living, I’m always cautious and alert, especially when alone. My dog attracts a lot of attention as well, so my first thoughts were “this person may be trying to take me, or trying to take my dog”. 
Regardless of the situation and whether my fears were legitimate, I just wanted to share and remind everyone to be safe and alert when out in the evenings, especially when alone. Even if you’re walking along a relatively busy street, you never know who may have ill intentions.

218,180840446,Giving Back,,21 Mar,"Today, March 21, is National Single Parent Day, a holiday honoring single moms and dads. This year it's more well-deserved than ever, with many singlehandedly juggling the day-to-day needs of their children with the unique challenges of parenting during a pandemic. 

But even those who do it all sometimes need the support of others. When that's the case, it's neighbors who often step up to help, assisting with basic needs, connecting them to local resources, and offering words of encouragement — a trend that's repeated itself again and again on Nextdoor.

➤ Michelle was living in a Chicago shelter last fall with her young daughter when she first turned to her neighbors, who supplied her with diapers, clothing, and a gift card for food. By March, she had posted an update: ""We begin our next journey and finally found an apartment and out of shelter life. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.""

 ➤ In Nitro, West Virginia, a mother of two was embarrassed to ask for help but was facing financial hardship and in need of basic supplies to get through the week. Neighbors not only provided her with milk, eggs, toilet paper, and bread, but with kind words and resources.

➤ Tara in Littleton, Colorado, put out a request for a ""random act of kindness"" for a homeless single dad and his 13-year-old son, who were sleeping in a heated garage. Within days, the community had secured him a phone, job leads, a vehicle, and temporary housing. ""My faith in humanity has been completely restored,"" she said. ""Our community is incredible!"""

Eve is microchipped and we left voicemails for the owner.  I ended up taking her on an adventure to Lowe's with us and drove around town.  She enjoyed the afternoon and was a good girl, 10/10.  

Eve is now at the Denver Animal Shelter since that's most likely the first place her parent(s) will check.  They are open until 18:30 and you'll need to bring proof of vaccinations with you.  I'm sorry I couldn't hold her overnight (it's impossible to know if she could be dog aggressive or not kennel trained, and I would never want to risk it), but I wanted to make sure she was safe.  

If she isn't claimed in five days they will notify me and I will bail her out of dog jail, but she was clean and very well cared for so I doubt that will happen.  Thank you to everyone who helped today!

If you're going to claim these feral cats have paperwork. I will STILL continue to trap neuter and return them. If you dont like it call the cops and see how far it gets you.  My only intent is to help these kitties. They're there because of irresponsible people. Most of these kitties also have giardia. Shortening their lifespan even further. But a good pet owner would keep up on things like this. The trap was just under a set of 4 or 5 mailboxes next to A huge Bush. So yes ill have to eat that. But if its damaged ill send you the bill. Even if i have to eat a tresspass ticket thats not grounds to destroy it. Had you looked up the organization on the trap youd have been instantly educated on what it's goal is. But again I harbor no ill intent towards the cats. If i find kittens they will be taken and vetted, adopted into homes where they will be loved and not left outside to fend for themselves. Im trying to get around and help as there is a colony near me also with someone ive spoken to already awhile ago. Im not trapping and disposing of cats. Im conducting TNR. Please spread this to your neighbors or anyone who may have unpapered, unvetted cats in that area. No papers its not your cat. You want to fight me on this expect a visit from animal control."

I was hoping someone would be able to help me with cat food for my babies.  I was able to get some cat food from a Pet Pantry, but unfortunately, since beggars can't be  choosers, I had to take what they gave me. This isn't working out at all for my kitties and they keep vomiting up the different foods that they get :(
I normally feed them Friskies shreds canned cat food and they do well on it.  If anyone is able to trade with me for me to get more Friskies shreds/meaty bits (no beef flavor-beef makes them trow up, too), that would be wonderful!  I have one 13 lb bag of Purina Cat Chow Gentle dry, (can't give them dry, either, I have a male prone to urinary problems), and 20 cans Science Diet and Pure  Vita canned foods. It would be a shame to not find a use for this food and also a big help in providing my guys with their much needed food.

298,171207610,Timothy Carter,Hale,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"General Update & Introductions. Hello to all of our new members and thank you so much for joining us! It's been heart warming to see our group grow to 30 members in less than a month! It's so good to see that our concerns are shared by others in the community , and that their are so many hands willing to work for good!

We have seen over the past month alone over a dozen sweeps of our Unhoused neighbours numbering in the hundreds of people displaced again and again. Moved from block to block, having their belongings discarded, and thier rights violated. The winter is cold enough already , but the city has been colder still. City council refused last month to adjust spending for homelessness mitigation despite several diverse and well thought out community proposals, in favor of increases to funding for sweeps and police overtime. ( The public education budget for next year is slashed btw & the police department is getting an extra 45 million)

Community volunteers have witnessed much over the past few months alone, police brutality, sexual assault by an officer , Hancocks excuses, city councils failure , and the displacement of hundreds more of our neighbours and friends due to the Covid related unemployment crises. 

But we have also made great strides together. We have a network of volunteers securing, storing, and preparing donations of food for sidewalk soup kitchen service, and soon we will have volunteers on the street every day to help feed and warm not just the homeless , but anyone who cares to stop , with a cup of warm soup or a hot coffee, to lessen the burden of their day. ( Interested in getting directly involved with sidewalk service ? Either securing donations , storing and preparing food and other goods, or helping with sidewalk service , please contact Cats Not Cops on Facebook or DM me for more info )

I apologize for a lack of updates on the sweeps that happened this week. For more consistent updates on sweeps and Denver Homeless Out Loud actions you can sign up for the email updates by emailing info@denverhomlessoutloud.org
These emails are unformated, hand typed updates with no nonsense, advertising or repetitive calls for monitary donations. It's just raw , informative updates on the week to week of our action plan and their results. 

This week the sweep of 16th and Pearl was heartbreaking. We have fed this encampment each week for the past month. Over 150 people who could not be admitted to the new church sponsored safe outdoor space  at 15th and Pearl were shuffled off to nowhere, losing possessions and losing more hope each time. 

I will make a post with updates on the action plan for next week as soon as I am privy."
299,167049733,City of Denver,,6 Nov,"Denver Issues New COVID-19 Restrictions Effective 10 p.m. Sunday, November 8. Denver has issued a ‘Home by 10’ Public Health Order to combat the dramatic increase of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the city. Effective for 30 days starting Sunday, November 8, all people in Denver should be home by 10 p.m., with certain exceptions, including going to and from work, interstate travel, and getting medical care. During this time, all public and private gatherings of people who are not members of a single household are prohibited, except for limited purposes. 

This is not intended to be a traditional curfew, but rather a restriction on gatherings, business hours, and a guidepost for behavior that will help Denver get through the next 30 days. Any business not defined as critical must close to the public during Home by 10 hours. Critical businesses include, but are not limited to, hospitals, grocery stores, and pharmacies. 

No alcohol sales or consumption after 10 p.m. will be permitted at any facility that sells alcohol, including restaurants and grocery and liquor stores. Restaurants will still be able to offer food takeout and delivery after 10 p.m. Under the new order, groups at restaurants will now be limited to six people from no more than two households, down from 10 people, for the duration of the Home by 10 public health order.

Recreational athletic activities, including organized youth and adult league sports, practices, games, and tournaments, are prohibited. Spectators are prohibited at all post-secondary and Colorado High School Activities Association (CHSAA) sanctioned sporting events.  

The city is taking this action to help stem the increase in cases and hospitalizations and avoid another stay-at-home order being imposed on Denver by the State.

Learn more about the city’s latest restrictions at https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/covid-19/public-orders.html."

Im figuring reaching out to our area representative/council member is one approach, but wanted to ask if there are other ways to generate a productive conversation to hopefully lead towards some action? I am sure I am not alone in wanting to see some change. I am sure the best way to help our neighborhood is to join together as a community, but even if that happens, what steps can be taken to reduce the crime? I know it's a systemic issue with unequal opportunities that leads to crime.  I don't know what to do but hopefully your replies to this post will help enlighten me and make it seem possible to make a small impact."

As we are quickly approaching the holidays we know that this time of year can be especially challenging for many families and especially now in the current state of our country. When you sit back and think about how truly blessed you are, think about those who may not be as blessed due to life’s circumstances.

💎Starting today through November 20th, Dust 2 Diamonds Jewelry Boutique will be taking donations of new hats, scarves, gloves and toiletries for men, women and children. We will go take all donations and pass them out to our homeless men, women and children in the hardest hit homeless areas in the Denver metro area. Please bring your donations to 5116 E 29th Ave Denver Co 80207 Mon-Fri 20-7pm Sat 11-8 Sun CLOSED!

💎We will also be going to several transitional housing locations for women providing them with blessing bags thanks to the generosity of several of you who have asked that your blessing to D2D be used to bless deserving women, so we have chosen women and survivors of domestic violence who are reclaiming their lives and on the path of transitioning back into the world and workplace. You feel good, you feel confident, you feel vibrant and determined when you LOOK GOOD!!! Our mission is to help make the process just a little bit easier❤️

If you would be interested in helping with either of these endeavors and have further questions, please feel free to give us a call at 720-583-0082 or email us at Dust2diamondsjewelry@gmail.com"

Right now Colorado does not have an eviction moratorium and limited eviction protections are set to expire TODAY!

We’re once again asking for your help to call on Governor Polis to #KeepColoradansHoused and demand an eviction moratorium to protect Colorado renters. We urge you to contact the Governor’s office at 303-886-2471 or tweet @GovOfCo  on behalf of our neighbors at risk of losing their home as we work to recover from the pandemic.

Without urgent action from Governor Polis, tens of thousands of Coloradans face homelessness, 300K-400K could be at risk of eviction by the end of the year. We have to make it clear to Governor Polis that our neighbors need action NOW.

We have had numerous conversations with clients in the past few days explaining that evictions have not been stopped at the national or state level, and that the limited protections that do exist expire tonight at midnight. 

Our actions have been moving the needle. Will you join us again in calling on the Governor to #KeepColoradansHoused

Here are some sample Twitter/FaceBook posts:

Thousands of Coloradans are unemployed. Expanded unemployment benefits have expired and Colorado has no eviction moratorium. @GovofCo we need you to step up to protect Colorado families from homelessness in the middle of a pandemic. Follow the lead of AZ and OR and #StopEviction #KeepColoradansHoused. 
The last thing people should be worried about right now is losing their home because they can’t pay rent. Coloradans need homes to be #SaferAtHome. Students need homes to attend school. @GovofCo please follow the lead of @GovInslee, @DougDucey and @KateBrownOR. #StopEvictions #KeepColoradansHoused. 
Taking the pandemic seriously means keeping Coloradans housed. You cannot be #SaferAtHome without a home. @GovofCo, hundreds of thousands are at risk. Do the right thing, issue an eviction moratorium.  https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk/
Oregon population 4.2 million, Colorado population 5.7 million, OR COVID rent relief $55 million, CO COVID rent relief $20 million, OR; eviction ban till Oct. CO: no eviction ban. @GovofCo follow Oregon’s lead. https://katu.com/news/local/oregon-distributes-70-million-in-covid-19-rental-relief-energy-assistance
Public benefits are expiring, and many Coloradans are not back at work full time. Evictions leave people exposed and in danger. @GovofCo, we need you. #KeepColoradansHoused https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk/
Why does Colorado continue to lag behind states like, Arizona, Oregon, and Washington on eviction protection? @GovofCo, let’s change that. #KeepColoradansHoused
We might all wish to be back at work in a post-pandemic world but we’re not. @GovofCo let’s acknowledge reality and #KeepColoradansHoused https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk/
Evictions resulting from the pandemic are not and do not have to be a political issue. @GovofCo we can, should, and must solve this together with landlords and tenants alike. #KeepColoradansHoused
Housing is a human right. Making thousands of people homeless during a pandemic is unspeakably cruel. We deserve better. Contact @GovofCo’s office at: 303-886-2471 demand action. #KeepColoradansHoused https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk/

And, ..... if your dog is inclined to enjoy their droppings, you may have had a dog with sudden bilious vomiting, and diarrhea.  Then it is off to the vet for flagyl and amp.  What you may not know is that it can also cause your to have dog seizures.  My beagles ate the geese poop and during this time of the year it was always a challenge to figure where to walk them so we did not run into the geese droppings.  My Daisy died a few days after having three back to back seizures and the vet informed me she had giradia.  We tried to help her, but to no avail.  She had no symptoms of GI distress.  Just thought you would like to know.  Avoid the geese.  It was their home before we built up the neighborhood.  I enjoy seeing them, but have to sweep the sidewalk when they meander onto my area."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/h92ob3/loststolen_dog_in_cap_hill_an_updateplea/

Please read below:

TLDR: my dog was claimed by a person experiencing homelessness roughly 400 ft from my house hours after getting loose in Cap Hill. Need as many eyeballs as I can get to locate him.

If you read my previous posts, my dog was “claimed” by a person who sometimes stays in the encampment on 13th and Wash roughly two hours after he got loose from my house on 13th and Ogden.

Over the last seven days, I have been to every shelter, several tent cities, resource centers, food banks and most churches that do hot food distribution to try and locate this guy. I have every homeless outreach team in the city and the Salvation Army “walkers” notified and on the look out and have flyered to bouncers and security guards who patrol businesses in the area.

As of Friday morning, it was confirmed the man was seen with Huck, tearing down my flyers outside of the liquor store on Logan and Colfax. I’m working w an angel of an employee at Good Chem to try and get security footage so I could at least have a facial ID.

If you live in the area and can help me look, that’s all I need...EYES. He goes up and down colfax, stays at the Y, Civic Center, and occasionally designated apartments and halfway houses near the Washington and 13th area. He’s a loner though, so most people I speak to can ID the dog but not him or his whereabouts.

It’s also possible he has migrated to the Cherry Creek Trail or Platte River Valley Trail in advance of the impending city camp clean up so if you bike those, please be on the lookout.

The guy is about 6 ft tall, has reddish blonde hair, is a middle aged ex vet who drinks and goes by John. He is calling my dog Babe and using a leather belt as a leash. People in the community who know this gentleman have suggested you do not approach. If you sight, please just contact me on here. I can be there ASAP with resources but even past sightings help so I can better narrow down his routines.

My dog is a Black and Tan Aussie Shepherd/Aussie Kelpie mix w a black speckled tongue, brown eyes, erect ears, and a natural bob tail that is only four inches long. If you walk your dog on colfax or surrounding parks, please pay attention! He’s very social and would be likely to say “hi” to your puppy. There are pics in my previous posts.

I’m devastated and desperate and have seen a lot of scary shit over the past couple of days...it hurts my heart that any living creature is experiencing these conditions, but selfishly I hate that my dog is currently living in and out of tent cities too and being around a lot of instability, hard drug use and violence.

When I was flyering on Friday, I met a guy doing outreach who after a few minutes of conversation, determined that we think he owns Huck’s littermate. We got them from the same shelter at the same time from a big litter that came in and they look like twins. I feel trolled that I can find Huck’s literal brother in a five minute happenstance meeting but can’t locate the guy within a mile radius of my house who has him 😞. I promise Reddit cute play date videos of the two puppies reuniting if you help me find my dog.

I am DESPERATE for any help or advice!
I have moved my whole life and last year, unknowingly, moved into an apartment infested with roaches. From January until about March or April, I saw them regularly. Since then, hardly any, until recently. 

I had SEVERAL treatments and did my own. At that time, I tried talking to the Colorado Apartment Association, however, each person I spoke with gave me different responses and was basically told, “Unless, they’re falling in my food, it’s not a problem.”I tried getting in contact with the health department, but with restrictions in place, I never got anywhere.  

Our complex got new management a few months ago during the warm months and they sent out notices to inspect every apartment and every building. I was excited to hear this, and since I hadn’t seen any, I naively assumed that they were gone. 

I have not brought it up yet to management about recent sitings (I will), however, since they have not been able to get rid of them previously , I want to see what steps to take. 

I’m moving next month and don’t want to take them with me!!! I’ve read several different things online about people saying they’ve managed to move successfully and others that haven’t...I know they hide in appliances and other things, and am not able to replace all my belongings.

I’m not sure if I buy a moving pod and bomb that or the apartment several times before moving. I keep calling exterminators but get representatives who just give me pricing options, but don’t sounds confident it’ll work. Andddd, Unfortunately, my renters insurance does not cover pest (lesson learned). 

Does anyone have experience/advice or know an actual exterminator who has experience!!??

A Woman was in the drivers seat steering. It seemed they were hoping to get the broken down car into the neighborhood over by Brakes Plus. 

I live on Quebec street so it‘s not uncommon to see a fellow commuter dealing with a bad day and a broken car. Usually a Park Hill neighbor will come out and ask if everything is ok. This was different, this man was really struggling to push this car and as the car gained some momentum into the intersection he couldn’t keep up and promptly tripped and rolled on his back revealing a prosthetic leg. At this point the car was slowing in the middle of the intersection and the man was struggling to get up. Of course, our light had turned green. I jumped out of my car and ran to help push the car to the other side. The man stumbled over and said “thank you sir”. I looked back and all I saw was a bunch of mouth breathers in their cars at the intersection staring at me. 

W....T....F Denver? What happened? How am I the only one that helped these people. We’re a community! We can do better. Denver showed up in droves for the protests, put the BLM signs in the front yards but people can’t get out of your air conditioned car to help a fellow human!?  Sad. 

If you are reading this you most likely weren’t at that intersection but my intention is to remind us all that moments like that, when you are the one in need and vulnerable, are the moments that make a city feel like a very lonely place. Keep an eye out for moments were you can change that please. Our city needs this.

No comments necessary. Just something to meditate on."

I called Walgreens, Safeway, and they have none now in their system. 
Does anyone know if any other systems have the Fluzone- 65 and older flu shot??- Like CVS, Costco, King Soopers or others?

I'm here posting to all of you because 9News has a new partnership with Nextdoor. Let me get a few things out in the open first: I can't see anything you and your neighbors post privately. That's your business. I can only see and interact with what you post on my posts or messages you send directly to me. 

So why the heck am I here? I'm here because I love the local part of my job. I believe what's happening in your community is the most important news you can receive. I also believe that sometimes we miss the best stories that happen within small communities.  I want to change that. And I need your help.

What's good in your neighborhood? What are neighbors doing for each other? Who deserves a shout out?  What needs change? What are the challenges you face? Any story you feel like sharing. Feel free to comment. Or message me. If you want - we might share something inspiring on the news. I've got 4 hours of weekend newscasts begging for great stories.

I see so much bickering on this platform and I feel like it could be used for so much more. Here's my favorite Nextdoor story so far: I'm an amateur homebrewer. After each batch, I have 10-15 pounds of spent grain that typically goes to waste.  A few years ago, I posted on my Centennial neighborhood Nextdoor - asking if anyone wanted it for compost. I met Heidi. She not only offered to take it off my hands. She offered to trade delicious produce grown in her backyard.

We can use this platform for good. Let's do it. I look forward to talking with you all through this platform! Thanks! - Steve"

381,151220460,"Steve Staeger, 9NEWS",,10 Jun,"Neighborhood Trades. Hi everyone! It's been a little while. Our newsroom has been overwhelmed covering COVID and the protests of George Floyd's death. All of it has been a bit overwhelming, but I wanted to share a happy neighborhood moment from this week and see if you've ever experienced anything like it in your neighborhood.

As I've mentioned far too many times here, I love to homebrew beer. It's a hobby that I've really ramped up to get me through this time at home.  This week I had a bucket of spent grain from a New England IPA I brewed.  I posted on my local Nextdoor to see if anyone needed compost. Mel messaged me that she'd love to use the spent grain and hops to feed her backyard chickens. In exchange - she gave me some eggs (and I threw in a homebrewed wheat ale). I scrambled a few eggs yesterday - they're delicious and you can tell the difference from store bought! She texted me later that the chickens LOVED the grains.  This is the beginning of another great partnership.

What kind of neighborhood trades do you do? I'm in the mood to be inspired. I'm also considering launching a ""Good Neighbors"" segment on 9News weekends.

Stay safe and stay healthy! - Steve"

398,169539467,Timothy Carter,Hale,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"Arkins Sweep Update. For the past couple months police have been telling people who they sweep from other more visible downtown sites to go to Arkins. Now the City has  come in to sweep them. To where???

Why not provide dumpsters with regular trash pick up? Why not provide port-a-potties (at least 1 for every 10 people)? And if not that...why not provide housing that residents of this camp can afford according to their info? 

No, instead our City thinks sweeping 300 people to scatter to downtown blocks, down the river, or who knows where else is the answer.

Yesterday was the second day of sweeps at the Arkins encampment. The previous night residents of the camp were told they could not get back into their property - some slept right outside the fence with what they had. Others scattered to who knows where without their property. Others were told they could go in, but if they came back out they could not get back in to get the rest of their property. In the morning, starting around 6am, the City started trashing property - indiscriminately scooping property with bulldozers and bobcats and crains. Anyone who had their property there but was not allowed in lost all their property. One of the only people who got their property yesterday was a woman we helped get back in to get her stuff just before they were about to trash it. 

After the sweep yesterday, police went to numerous other camps around town - many where residents from Arkins moved to - telling them they could not be there under camping ban enforcement. People trying to move from the Arkins sweep were stopped from setting up at various camps - including cops threatening volunteers helping folks move with “illegal dumping” if they unloaded the person’s property.

I have a friend who works with the homeless in downtown Denver. While the Coronavirus may actually pose little real threat to most of us, it poses a huge threat to those whose immune systems are already compromised. Thanks to all the people who CAN use soap and water (i.e. have regular access to SINKS) there is no hand sanitizer to be found anywhere. Yes, soap and water work fine IF YOU HAVE REGULAR ACCESS TO RUNNING WATER, which the homeless do not. 

My friend has gotten his hands on hundreds of small bottles that we need to fill with hand sanitizer to pass out to the homeless. Yes, we can make our own hand sanitizer but we need roughtly SIXTEEN GALLONS of it to fill the need! Hand sanitizer is basically just three parts alcohol with an alcohol content of 90% of above to one part emollient such as aloe vera or vegetable glycerine.  Most stores are also sold out of even the supplies needed to make it. 

We can purchase four gallons of alcohol for $100 and one gallon of vegetable glycerine for $12. If you can order either one and/ or donate or contribute, we need about $340 to make the sixteen gallons of hand sanitizer we need. That will fill 500 two-ounce bottles and provide one refill for each of those bottles. If you can donate or contribute, here are the links:

The city, working with partners, provides emergency, one time per year grants to pay either water or sewer bills. All funds are targeted at keeping service on. There is also financial help from local charities. More details on City of Aurora water bill assistance programs.

Thornton Colorado is providing hundreds of thousands of dollars in “free money” to help people pay their water bills. The program goes by the name of Thornton Cares and it is a new program that was created to help Adams County and Thornton Colorado residents with their water bills.

People who are interested will have to qualify for assistance. You need to be a legal resident of Colorado, or a U.S. citizen and you also need to be a Thornton water customer in order to get water bill aid. There are some income criteria as well.

If you do qualify for the water bill assistance, you will receive free money in the form of a one-time $100 grant or credit to your water bill. Or if you decide to, you can receive the financial aid over a period of 12 months.

It is estimated that thousands of Thornton and Adams County residents would benefit from this financial aid program that will run for at least a period of one year. People are eligible to apply for one time financial assistance starting June 1. If you are interested, you first must contact Utility Billing (303-658-2392), which will then provide a referral to the Water Bill Assistance Program. Or find other ways to get help paying water bills.

476,139426729,Jan H.,Lowry,4 Mar 20,"Aggressive woman panhandler and her young son in Safeway parking lot. This is an alert to be aware of an escalating and potentially dangerous situation in the Safeway parking lot:
A neighborhood woman panhandler (often head/hoodie covered)- who is well known to Safeway and to police- has been regularly, aggressively panhandling in the Safeway parking lot. She usually has her young son (?age 7-9) (hoodie covered) with her. This week is the second time in the last couple of months that she appeared out of nowhere around dusk/dark and has rushed to approach me at my car asking for money. The first time she literally stood between my open car door and me, blocking me from entering my car. This week, I was maneuvering to get my elderly father in the car when I saw her rushing across the parking lot towards my car. My husband was the last to get into our car so she rushed him as he opened his door, calling him a ""white SOB"" when he declined to give her money. She is very intimidating, and it all happens so fast that you may not initially realize what is occurring until she is in your face or space. I have spoken with the Safeway store manager, and learned that the police are involved.  She is ""trespassing"" when she is in the Safeway parking lot or in the store (all store property). Police have advised that customers should avoid interacting with her, and should not give her money or gift cards on their property at this point, because this has only served to increase her aggressive/persistent behavior. The woman panhandler lives close to Safeway. Her name and address are known to police and others. 
Please, be on the lookout for your own safety and call 911 or go back into the store for help if the situation dangerously escalates. 
It is unclear why the police do not/cannot do more. I am unaware of any known mental health or substance issues. But she is not someone to mess with. Others have reported this information to the police."

Thanks to everyone who replied to my first post. I’m trying to keep up with the volume.

We heard from a few of you asking where I lived, and how I was posting to multiple Nextdoors. I’m a Denver metro area resident like you, and this is part of a partnership between Nextdoor and 9NEWS. Nextdoor is trying to make sure that trusted local journalists, in your area, are covering stories that are important to you, and they’re helping make that happen by helping us talk to everyone in the Denver area. 

Neither I nor 9NEWS has access to your neighborhood posts. The only interaction I have with you is through your comments on my posts or your private messages to me.  

This is why my first post wanted to know both what you’re doing…and how you’re doing...during our sudden “social distancing”.

The hope is that we can become better listeners to the neighborhoods in our area.  So what stories are important to you? What do you want to see your local reporters talking about today? You can let me know in a reply.

Thanks,
Tom"

I recently discovered (by smell) that he had pooped under my bed. He has been using the litter box so I am really confused as to why he would do this. Some of it was fresh too. I didn’t notice any pee under the bed. 

He’s been hiding under the bed a lot since I’ve brought him home but has been coming out more and more. He’s a little timid but purrs a lot and loves to be pet. I think he feels really safe under the bed. 

What is the best way to clean my carpet now? I removed the poo, which was all firm, but a slight smell still lingers.  

Also how can I deter this behavior and help him? Any help greatly appreciated!!"

Denver is gradually moving from an emergency response phase into a period of relief and recovery. This does not mean that COVID-19’s threat to your health has passed – it remains very real – but city and community leaders are planning and beginning to implement a path forward that preserves community health and safety, while balancing it with economic well-being. Here’s a glance at what May will look like in the city of Denver:

• Face coverings are now mandatory while inside of or waiting in line to enter any retail or commercial business, or any location or facility offering government or health care services, and waiting for or riding on public transportation. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2xLiqPV. 

• On Saturday, May 9, some businesses will gradually begin to re-open with strict social distancing and face covering guidelines in place, including precautions to limit both the number of employees onsite at a given time, as well as the number of customers. Public and private gatherings of more than 10 people will continue to be prohibited through May 26.

Lanky guy in muted colored clothes with big back pack actually tried taking our dog. He was bending over the fence and my 6yr old was right there, I was two feet from her and he was out of view. I just don’t like it when my dog barks for no reason and was able to confront him. He left going north on the bike, had a small to mid size gray plastic kennel on the back of his bike. There’s less people out now, maybe he thought it was a good time. But we were right there! Just be aware, and report if you see him. Police were great about it and more responsive than expected. Also he was riding his bike on the sidewalk and that’s weird on our block, so that’s something else to look for.

Top: Muted colored jacket also wearing a big full backpack

553,154297474,Tom Fesing,East Colfax,9 Jul,"Flag of the Day - Argentina 🇦🇷. Today marks 204 years of Argentine independence, thus marking 200 years of the Declaration of Independence of the United Provinces of the Rio de La Plata. Referred to as the Independence of Argentina, it was declared on July 9, 1816 by the Congress of Tucumán. 

The Argentine independence movement began in 1806, when British attacks on Buenos Aires were repelled by local militia with little help from Spain. Also important were the ramifications of Napoleon I’s intervention in Spain, beginning in 1808. Napoleon’s overthrow of Ferdinand VII plunged Spain into a civil war between two rival governments—one set up by Napoleon and the other created by patriotic juntas in the name of the exiled king and aided by the British. Under ancient principles of Spanish law, the king’s dominions in America had the right to govern themselves until the restoration of a lawful king, and on May 25, 1810 (now celebrated as the day of the revolution), Buenos Aires established an autonomous viceroyalty in the name of Ferdinand, pending his restoration. However, when it became apparent that Ferdinand was virtually powerless following his restoration in 1814, an assembly of the members of the viceroyalty met at a home in San Miguel de Tucumán to discuss the situation. On July 9, 1816, they declared the country independent under the name of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata.

The flag of Argentina was created by Manuel Belgrano, in line with the creation of the Cockade of Argentina, and was first raised at the city of Rosario on February 27, 1812, during the Argentine War of Independence. The National Flag Memorial was later built on the site. The First Triumvirate did not approve the use of the flag, but the Asamblea del Año XIII allowed the use of the flag as a war flag. It was the Congress of Tucumán which finally designated it as the national flag, in 1816. A yellow Sun of May was added to the center in 1818.

There is controversy of the true color of the first flag, between scientist and the descendants of Manuel Belgrano between blue and pale blue.

The sun image on the flag is called the Sun of May because it is a replica of an engraving on the first Argentine coin, approved in 1813, whose value was eight escudos(one Spanish dollar). It has 16 straight and 16 waved sunbeams.

We have an immediate need for housing, and Denver has made it a priority to address that need by working to make more options available for everybody. For the last two years, Denver city planners have been working with residents, policy experts, advocates and service providers, neighborhood groups and other community members to update the Denver Zoning Code’s regulations on residential uses.

The project's goal is to update zoning rules in support of the city’s strategy for more and better housing opportunities for all residents, to remove barriers for those who need supportive services and to provide greater clarity for providers and neighbors.

Starting next week, we'll host four open houses that will give residents an overview of the changes and an opportunity to share their thoughts.

We've been taking care of a stray cat for the last two and a half years. We feed him (I know...) and we've even made him a shelter on our porch during bad weather. However, he does leave for days at a time and I wonder if anyone else in the neighborhood (Newport and Colfax) is also taking care of him or sees him around. He never goes south to Colfax. He tends to wonder up towards 16th. He's super sweet but very shy. After all this time, he still won't let us get close.

Does anyone know a way to get something done about this as these same guys have been showing up here for a year and I've been polite to them only to be met with drunken or drugged up men 3 yards from my kids window.

Update : they've  moved a couch to the back yard up against the house and have been drinking there all day going from 1 guy to 5 guys building their camp with hammers and tools possibly taken from the staff zone they get beer money at, I've called everyone I can think to help, maybe if others in the neighborhood call the police might finally remove the camps they're building before they get too set in

Update 6am: 1456 and 1450 both now have camps, woke up for work and guy was making himself at home 2 yards away from my back door, called the cops don't know what to do from here, moving is expensive but it seems like that's what the city is trying to tell its citizens to do when things like this transpire, I'm just totally drained from the situation

629,154659538,Tina Hartley,North Park Hill,12 Jul,"Quebec Home Depot - Why are HD is not requiring customers to wear masks. Dear Neighbors. 
First, this is not a rant. Just want you all to know that today I was told by the stores' management that the reason they are not enforcing the requirement of customers to wear masks is for the safety and well being of their employees. Yes, you heard me correctly. 

This HD's employees are being threatening and verbally abused by these maskless people when they ask them to wear a mask. Local HD management believes it is the police departments responsibility to enforce the law. 

So these maskless people expect service from people that they are putting at risk. Is that the ultimate in disrespect? We customers can choose not to patronize this Home Depot, but these employees do not have that luxury.

So the next time you go to Home Depot and see customers without masks (or wearing their mask around their neck or just over their mouth) realize what the net-net is of this behavior. And, please thank the employees for what they are doing; risking their lives.

Tina"
