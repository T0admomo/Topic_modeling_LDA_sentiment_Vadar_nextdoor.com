8,JzbPGGZX3j6-,Michael King,South Park Hill,7 Apr,"Homeless Tent City in North Park Hill? When were we able to voice our say on this? To whom it may concern (and it should concern everyone) in our wonderful North Parkhill neighborhood: I was literally floored and became sick to my stomach once I heard the news that Was just presented to me by a friend. Honestly I can’t see how this location would be considered an appropriate location for housing homeless population. This was apparently approved “under the radar” and was in the works without many knowing about it! Question: Who is going to police this and keep our children’s safety top priority? Who is going to keep the area sanitized and clean of debris that we already see all over the city where these tent cities currently exist? Not to mention our property values will likely diminish as a result of this horrible decision.. I am all for finding an appropriate location to house our homeless population, but as a tax payer it would have been nice to have had a say in the decision, but instead it was pushed through under the radar! I mean really, smack dab in the middle of our established neighborhood that is literally a block from our public library and grade school? This is the “Wrong” location and the “Wrong” decision by our state and local authorities. Ultimately This will present a major safety issue for our neighbors and our children, and is a very very bad thing for North Parkhill overall.. Something needs to be done to stop this atrocity!

20,DYFp2DkQQ3ft,Jim Hannifin,South Park Hill,6 days ago,"Regarding PHUMC Safe Outdoor Space. Some people might presume that many of the people who are out on the streets are there because they were criminals, pedophiles, addicts - or at least maybe anti-social, and based on that might oppose a fenced Safe Outdoor Space tent village in our neighborhood. Of course! Mostly they’re pretty regular folks, though, it turns out. Our nation used to have a different economic and social framework than we have today. One of the social support structures that our forebears had were their Churches. God bless PHUMC for stepping up to re-take that role. So far, churches have been the only landowners to offer usable land for Safe Outdoor Spaces to move people off the street curbs. Regarding S.O.S.s: The difference between the improvement of moving from an apartment into your first house does not remotely compare to the improvement of moving from a tent on a city street-curb, into a tent within a fenced-in enclosure of a church parking lot with san-o-lets, trash service, social structure, electricity, and no fear of having your base “swept” away by city cleaning crews any random day. An S.O.S is still minimal, but is a haven of peace to people who need a haven of peace. A precedent: The S.O.S. in the church lot on 16th and Pearl was already built before they decided that they were going to invite everyone from what I saw as the wild filthy crazy “un-sanctioned” camp across the street, to move into the new S.O.S. It’s what I think a Jesus would have done, but still I expected disaster. (And I was one of the volunteers!) Yet when I visited it two weeks later, and multiple times since, it is a Haven of Peace. There are one or two bright bold larger than life characters, but there is peace and security, and there is healing and grace. It is managed by a firm and loving staff and appreciated by grateful campers. I do not think the larger neighborhood will be impacted for the worse by this camp. (Note there are background checks because of the nearby day-care, too.) I hope they will be surprised to find that the lot has been transformed into something more humanely beautiful and somehow more tranquil than a barren asphalt lot. And it is only for six months. Kids can still play. Children have agile perception. Teach kids to be wary, but not afraid. That’s how I grew up and I feel my life is richer, for it. These people who will stay in an S.O.S. aren’t the dregs that a “worst-case” mindset imagines; and we need to do something better than what has been done until now for our fellow humans. I am proud of this church, and of Park Hill, for stepping up, and I hope that we can crow to the rest of the city: This is what Park Hill does, and you can, too. (And if it turns out it isn’t “all that”, we can adjust things!)"

Property crime is up 55% year over year, violent crimes are up 8.2% year over year. The police budget for Denver county is down 11% from 2020. There’s more crime than ever, and law enforcement funding is at a 10 year low. I’m sure partly due to covid and partly to social initiatives. It’s not that the police don’t care to come check out your suspicious activity, or my car that was broken into, but they don’t have the bandwidth and must prioritize violent crimes. It’s sad that our neighborhoods are getting less safe by the week it seems. But expecting law enforcement to reduce its funding and manpower and deal with a 55% increase in property crimes is just not fair."

28,g6snPZkXt266,Mark Kaplan,Mayfair,17 Mar,"Colorado House Bill 21-1160 that would lead to unnecessary euthanasia of adoptable animals. Neighbors – I am posting this message to make you aware of Colorado House Bill 21-1160 that is currently in legislative committee. If the bill is enacted as currently worded it could lead to the closure of no kill shelters in Colorado and the unnecessary euthanasia of many animals that, with love and caring, are adoptable and go on to live happy and enriching lives with their families. Below is the text of a letter from Barbara Weller, the President of the Board of Directors of MaxFund Animal Adoption Center, a no kill shelter in Denver, addressing the impact of the bill. I will also provide my perspective here. I have been a volunteer for the past three years at MaxFund, whose mission is to care for and find homes for injured and abused animals. Many of the animals taken in by MaxFund are sick or injured and, unsurprisingly, exhibit behavioral issues. MaxFund treats and rehabilitates these animals and brings them back to health. When necessary, it even provides adaptive equipment to them so that they may lead quality lives. When I started volunteering at MaxFund I primarily expected to spend time walking dogs to provide them with exercise and some time out of the shelter. While that has certainly been the case, I have seen a much more important benefit that MaxFund and its amazing staff and volunteers provide to the animals. They devote incredible energy over days, weeks and often months spending time with the animals, showing them love and compassion, and teaching them to trust people and other animals. The animals’ lives are transformed and they are then able to be adopted into loving homes. I recently fostered a MaxFund dog for five months. She is an amazing dog but clearly had not been socialized with other animals and exhibited aggressive behavior when she saw them. Her behavior improved tremendously the more time we spent together. She ultimately was adopted by a loving family which hired a trainer to continue to work with her, and she now lives happily with them and their cat (which initially would have been impossible). In another example, one of MaxFund’s volunteers adopted a partially paralyzed dog and has spent more than a year providing physical therapy for him. A huge smile came over her face when she recently told me how her dog is now able to walk and is living a great life with her. I have experienced great joy seeing many dogs come out of their shells and go on to loving homes as a result of the mission and efforts of MaxFund and the people associated with it. More than a few adopters create Instagram accounts for their pets and we are able to continue to follow their lives. It is truly inspirational. However, if House Bill 21-1160 becomes law, MaxFund could be required to euthanize many of these animals. Not all animal rescues have the same mission as no kill shelters like MaxFund. In Colorado, our leaders and citizens should be encouraging organizations like MaxFund and the people who support them to save helpless animals. Instead, House Bill 21-1160 would have the opposite effect. If this is an issue that you care about, then please send an email to the bill’s sponsors and committee members expressing your view. Below is a list of their emails, as well as a link to the bill if you would like to read it. I understand that there is a committee hearing on the bill on March 22, although I do not know the time and location. I have also included a link to a petition created by one of MaxFund’s volunteers that you can sign. Thank you. Sincerely, Mark Kaplan Link to House Bill 21-1160: Link to Petition: Barbara Weller Letter: Dear MaxFund Volunteers, Staff and Supporters, There is a Colorado legislative bill known as House Bill 21-1160 that is currently being considered in committee for enactment. This Bill pertains to all animals that enter into a Colorado shelter. The major portion of the Bill addresses shelters adopting out ""healthy, safe and social"" animals. This scenario is already being followed by most shelters and is regulated by PACFA. . The disturbing portion of this Bill addresses those marginal, homeless pets that arrive in shelters in less than perfect condition. These are the animals needing medical intervention, behavior modification or are simply elderly. They are our blind, deaf, paralyzed, feral, diabetic, abused and broken cats and dogs. These are the animals that we champion. MaxFund was founded to care for these animals and is the reason why we continue to exist to this very day. Passage of House Bill 21-1160 would put less than perfect animals in harm's way. No standard criteria is found in the Bill which defines ""quality of life."" Instead of allowing shelters to provide refuge and care for these animals, it allows arbitrary decisions to be made based upon someone's subjective interpretation of an animal's quality of life. Those animals deemed lacking life's quality could be sent away or euthanized. We at MaxFund know better. We see these less than perfect animals enter our shelter. We provide them with whatever services are needed. We watch them thrive under the care and love from our staff and foster families. We see them blossom and, most importantly, we see them go to loving forever homes. MaxFund and No-Kill Colorado need your action to prevent this Bill from being enacted. Right now it is in legislative committee. We want to stop it while it is in committee so that it is never even presented for vote. Representatives from MaxFund and David Smyth from No-Kill Colorado will be attending a hearing of this Bill on March 22, 2021. Please contact Selina [Davison] if you are interested in attending. Between now and then we hope to inundate the Bill's sponsors and committee members with our opposition to it. I urge everyone to call or write to the sponsors of this Bill and to copy your objections to all its committee members. Please also send a copy to Davyd Smith of No-Kill Colorado at and to Selina at so that we can track the strength of opposition for the March 22nd committee meeting. If you prefer calling instead, the Capitol phone number is 303 866-2583. Let Selina know that you have left a message of opposition. Please write letter to these Sponsors: Sponsors: Joann Ginal Matt Soper Monica Duran Committee Members: Jeni James Arndt Marc Catlin Richard Holtorf Barbara McLachlan Dylan Roberts Perry Will Karen McCormick Lisa Cutter Susan Lontine Rod Pelton Donald Valdez Thank you for your support of MaxFund and for all shelter animals.

Many of you who walk these streets probably know the home. You would recognize it by the double-lot it sits on, the huge shady trees, the pergola in the yard that has been there for over 100 years and the gorgeous turn-of the century architecture. Neighbors are horrified and shocked to see the demolition suddenly begin. Surprisingly, this destruction and permanent damage to the neighborhood can happen without any notice. Not knowing the “plan”, we can surmise that this decision was made from a perspective of short-sighted values and self-serving interests.

He just released his ""Perfect 10"" newsletter explaining why he decided to ignore the overwhelming (80%) opposition from us pesky citizens who voted for him. His reasoning (which you can read for yourself) boiled down to his belief that all of us who opposed the measure were driven by fear, not logic. Throw in a little racism, ageism, socio economicism, fear of criminals, fear of REALLY nice developers, etc and it was his duty to overrule our will (the pesky people who voted for him). Thus, being the superior human being that he surely is, he boldly followed nine of his colleagues forcing changes down our throats that we just don't understand we need bringing real life right to the doorsteps of our homes, schools, businesses, etc. Don't worry, pesky citizens, if things get out of hand as a result of the new Amendment, we the City Council, will immediately fix all of the problems we created just like we fix all of the other problems we've created year after year.

Now, as Chris and his colleagues sit back patting themselves on their backs for their bold social justice votes, they leave us to deal with the everyday ramifications of the reality of their plan. Fingers crossed it's not on your street that group homes form, halfway houses pop up, etc. It certainly won't be on the street of the mayor or multiple city council members who exempted their own neighborhoods from the amendment. Representive government is supposed to actually represent its citizens. Hinds and nine others went rogue and he and the others should be removed from office."

It was parked outside of our house on 12/21/20 for ~48 hours with a woman in the passenger seat. She did not leave the vehicle the entire time. I witnessed her smoking a pipe and dumping liquids outside the vehicle. When my husband approached the vehicle to check on her she shoed him away. Eventually, we called the non emergency police line to report a suspicious vehicle. When the police arrived we heard them state the woman had a warrant for her arrest, followed by them handcuffing her, and taking her away in their police vehicle. Shortly after (~30mins), the police returned with the woman and she remained in the vehicle until next morning when we woke and the vehicle was gone. Then today when we woke, 1/5/20, the vehicle was parked on the side of our house with the same woman in the passenger seat. It is a white chevy box truck. The license plate is AZL Q21.

62,Hcj2L2zGPFbq,Mark Kaplan,Mayfair,18 Mar,"Colorado House Bill 21-1160 that would lead to unnecessary euthanasia of adoptable animals. I posted this message yesterday in the General section of NextDoor but it has been suggested to me that I also post it here since some people do not read that section. I apologize for the duplication and there are numerous comments to the initial post that I will not copy here. There are also links in those comments for those who want to view or testify at the hearing on Monday (either remotely or in person). Neighbors – I am posting this message to make you aware of Colorado House Bill 21-1160 that is currently in legislative committee. If the bill is enacted as currently worded it could lead to the closure of no kill shelters in Colorado and the unnecessary euthanasia of many animals that, with love and caring, are adoptable and go on to live happy and enriching lives with their families. Below is the text of a letter from Barbara Weller, the President of the Board of Directors of MaxFund Animal Adoption Center, a no kill shelter in Denver, addressing the impact of the bill. I will also provide my perspective here. I have been a volunteer for the past three years at MaxFund, whose mission is to care for and find homes for injured and abused animals. Many of the animals taken in by MaxFund are sick or injured and, unsurprisingly, exhibit behavioral issues. MaxFund treats and rehabilitates these animals and brings them back to health. When necessary, it even provides adaptive equipment to them so that they may lead quality lives. When I started volunteering at MaxFund I primarily expected to spend time walking dogs to provide them with exercise and some time out of the shelter. While that has certainly been the case, I have seen a much more important benefit that MaxFund and its amazing staff and volunteers provide to the animals. They devote incredible energy over days, weeks and often months spending time with the animals, showing them love and compassion, and teaching them to trust people and other animals. The animals’ lives are transformed and they are then able to be adopted into loving homes. I recently fostered a MaxFund dog for five months. She is an amazing dog but clearly had not been socialized with other animals and exhibited aggressive behavior when she saw them. Her behavior improved tremendously the more time we spent together. She ultimately was adopted by a loving family which hired a trainer to continue to work with her, and she now lives happily with them and their cat (which initially would have been impossible). In another example, one of MaxFund’s volunteers adopted a partially paralyzed dog and has spent more than a year providing physical therapy for him. A huge smile came over her face when she recently told me how her dog is now able to walk and is living a great life with her. I have experienced great joy seeing many dogs come out of their shells and go on to loving homes as a result of the mission and efforts of MaxFund and the people associated with it. More than a few adopters create Instagram accounts for their pets and we are able to continue to follow their lives. It is truly inspirational. However, if House Bill 21-1160 becomes law, MaxFund could be required to euthanize many of these animals. Not all animal rescues have the same mission as no kill shelters like MaxFund. In Colorado, our leaders and citizens should be encouraging organizations like MaxFund and the people who support them to save helpless animals. Instead, House Bill 21-1160 would have the opposite effect. If this is an issue that you care about, then please send an email to the bill’s sponsors and committee members expressing your view. Below is a list of their emails, as well as a link to the bill if you would like to read it. There is a committee hearing on the bill on Monday March 22 at 1:30 pm in Room 0107 at the state Capitol, 200 E. Colfax Ave., Denver. I have also included a link to a petition created by one of MaxFund’s volunteers that you can sign. Thank you. Sincerely, Mark Kaplan Link to House Bill 21-1160: Link to Petition: Barbara Weller Letter: Dear MaxFund Volunteers, Staff and Supporters, There is a Colorado legislative bill known as House Bill 21-1160 that is currently being considered in committee for enactment. This Bill pertains to all animals that enter into a Colorado shelter. The major portion of the Bill addresses shelters adopting out ""healthy, safe and social"" animals. This scenario is already being followed by most shelters and is regulated by PACFA. . The disturbing portion of this Bill addresses those marginal, homeless pets that arrive in shelters in less than perfect condition. These are the animals needing medical intervention, behavior modification or are simply elderly. They are our blind, deaf, paralyzed, feral, diabetic, abused and broken cats and dogs. These are the animals that we champion. MaxFund was founded to care for these animals and is the reason why we continue to exist to this very day. Passage of House Bill 21-1160 would put less than perfect animals in harm's way. No standard criteria is found in the Bill which defines ""quality of life."" Instead of allowing shelters to provide refuge and care for these animals, it allows arbitrary decisions to be made based upon someone's subjective interpretation of an animal's quality of life. Those animals deemed lacking life's quality could be sent away or euthanized. We at MaxFund know better. We see these less than perfect animals enter our shelter. We provide them with whatever services are needed. We watch them thrive under the care and love from our staff and foster families. We see them blossom and, most importantly, we see them go to loving forever homes. MaxFund and No-Kill Colorado need your action to prevent this Bill from being enacted. Right now it is in legislative committee. We want to stop it while it is in committee so that it is never even presented for vote. Representatives from MaxFund and David Smyth from No-Kill Colorado will be attending a hearing of this Bill on March 22, 2021. Please contact Selina [Davison] if you are interested in attending. Between now and then we hope to inundate the Bill's sponsors and committee members with our opposition to it. I urge everyone to call or write to the sponsors of this Bill and to copy your objections to all its committee members. Please also send a copy to Davyd Smith of No-Kill Colorado at and to Selina at so that we can track the strength of opposition for the March 22nd committee meeting. If you prefer calling instead, the Capitol phone number is 303 866-2583. Let Selina know that you have left a message of opposition. Please write letter to these Sponsors: Sponsors: Joann Ginal Matt Soper Monica Duran Committee Members: Jeni James Arndt Marc Catlin Richard Holtorf Barbara McLachlan Dylan Roberts Perry Will Karen McCormick Lisa Cutter Susan Lontine Rod Pelton Donald Valdez Thank you for your support of MaxFund and for all shelter animals.

73,ZT_thHJj59Ff,Timothy Carter,Hale,1 Dec,"Denver Homeless Out Loud. On December 15th and 16th, 2020, Federal District 10 Judge Martinez will be hearing our case against the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for violating constitutional rights by sweeping people without homes and with nowhere to go - even in a global pandemic. This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housing - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, “The CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.”  On top of this the suit addresses that, “Over the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (“to where?” is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).” The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can’t afford housing during this pandemic.  Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that “when I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.” Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time.  Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. There will be a call-in number where the public can listen to the hearing. Stay tuned for this number. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to the hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place.  Documentation of full lawsuit is publicly available. Contact: 720-940-5291"
74,JMctg8F35xSz,Jerson Alvarenga,Hilltop,26 Jan,"Burglary. Early this morning a crime was, again, committed at my property with a beak in and theft. Welcome to the Hunger Games of Denver and Hilltop where burglary is allowed (not to mention gun shots) and where it is treated like an expected, common occurance that is treated more like your problem rather than a crime with a criminal perpetrating violence and flauting safety not to mention the law. Your property is not respected as your property anymore and the police department will respond to the event whenever they want, even after you have called them the 5 times for 5 separate criminal events in our neighborhood on and near my property. I reported a break  and burglery on my property where over $20,000 of theft and damage was done at 3:16am this morning. The police showed up at 4:51am, 1 hour and 35 minutes later.  I thought I lived in a safe and desirable and prominent neighborhood in Denver, but it seems like it is worse than the suburbs of Newark, New Jersey, where I lived for 7 years and I never had to report any crime on or near my property. I have been in this neighborhood less than 6 months and I have had 5 official reports and nothing has happened - not one investigation has been completed on any of the incidents and I have never once recieved any progress report on any of them. I guess I will have to stop reporting these crimes and just watch it on my video cameras and let it happen. Don't waste your time on calling for the authorities for help because they won't help you, and I am speaking from my experience. And there is no mechanism for supplying feedback to the police department - just bureauracy that is designed to shield the department from complaints. Good luck, by the way I have to keep turning these thefts and crimes into my insurance company so the insurance prices are going up in the neighborhood as are our crime statistics which is not good for our property values.

We passed by him this morning on our walk, he was sleeping on the ground without any blanket or anything. He lost his job in March because of COVID 19 and lost his housing . Thank you Update: I just spoke to David , he said the only thing he would be grateful for is food and water and if anybody would like to bring him a warm meal occasionally he would love that he said, apparently a neighbor brought him some rice and beans one night and his face lid up talking about it and how delicious that was . He said he wants to keep his belonging simple because the less he has the less vulnerable he feels , he’s had other homeless steal some shoes of his feet in the night and someone actually stole his sleeping bag while sleeping in it . He says he’s adjusted to the cold and feels content with what he has for the time being. He’s grateful he’s been allowed to hang out at congress park , feels pretty safe there , and would rather not bring to much attention to himself so he’s not asked to leave right now . Apparently he has a job interview on Friday - fingers crossed 🤞"

On Monday, February 8th at around 11:10 PM my husbands tool box ON THE BACK of his work truck was broken into and all of his tools were stolen out of it. His company work truck is always parked directly in front of our house as it is too large to fit in our driveway. We live on 13th and Eudora. My Husband left for work around 6:30am Tuesday morning and noticed the lid to his toolbox was hitting the back of his Windshield so he pulled over to see why it was opened. The padlock he uses to lock it was gone so a hammer or another tool was used to pry open the lock. Every night when he comes home from work he double checks to make sure his tools are secured. Everything that was inside his toolbox was wiped out which valued around $2000. My husband knew that it had to have been at least two people, due to how quick they broke into the toolbox, how quiet they were and how fast they emptied it. We later learned from our neighbor across the street of the time frame. She seen 2 Caucasian Males, One of the males was balding. They were in a silver older model sedan with UN-tinted windows and were parked outside in front of her house smoking a cigarette which was directly across the street from my husbands work truck. At the time our neighbor didn’t know who they were as they just moved into the neighborhood a month ago. It was only about 5 minutes when she initially heard her dog barking that initially got her attention and upon opening her door to see who the 2 guys were and why they were standing outside at their vehicle, they took off. This is our only information we have so far as I’ve asked several neighbors if they have any surveillance on ring cameras/home surveillance but unfortunately nothing has came up. Please be on the lookout for any suspicious cars in the neighborhood. Always lock your doors even during the day as 8 months prior to this two cars on our block were rummaged through when doors were unlocked as these incidents both took place during the day. As soon as we have more information or if they apprehend any suspects I will give an update. At this time unfortunately the tools that were in my husband‘s work truck were his personal tools so the company he works for will not cover it as it’s his loss. We did make a police report of this incident. I have reported this information to the police. Description of person involved – Hair: Balding, Top: Unknown of clothing, Race: Caucasian, Sex: Male Description of person involved – Hair: Hair, Top: Unknown clothing, Race: Caucasian, Sex: Male Description of vehicle involved – Color: Silver, Make: Sedan, Year: Older, Other details: No tinted windows"

It truly has piqued my curiosity as this is a very common thing, having outdoor, free roaming pet cats, with or without collars where I’m from. I want to state that my own two cats are indoor only, but I never really have too much concern for the neighborhood friendly, well kept pet cats that roam around the houses, and seem to just seek some petting.

I need you to understand that this opportunity is for the rest of the homeless community and I have to say that possibly half the community has received the same amount of money and the same exact choice as I have had. I'm not going to shy away from the fact that I chose to pay some bills before I bought my drugs and if they don't want to do anything but blow it all away that's fine but that's a very serious issue that needs to be made aware of and you know the problem will never go away if they are not going to be held accountable for their actions and decisions that they chose to make in the aspect of the homeless community that have had this opportunity for a chance at doing something different than continuing to be a part of the problem as a victim we understand is crap and the only reason we don't have the opportunity for the people to do what they are going around and raging out crying out and being the most important person who was their own individual self oppressed stuck in this situation and NOT you who help continually or anyone else but that individual. I need you to understand that only maybe half the community or something is being the way of the homeless community never getting the chance they are crying out for and persecuting people who have no role in the decision that person made when they got 7 to 12000 dollars back pay and then chose to blow it off with drugs and alcohol and their whatever other choices. I'm open for you and I to get an interview with each other set and you and I have a lot of questions about time together to make an impact in our understanding of what is going to need to be implemented by us experienced in our own way and we have a very strong and positive attitude towards this standard strategy for the future innovation of all of us getting to the point of being the good and correct stew.

130,EuuzFKD7aJUS,Jude Wolf,South Park Hill,22 Sep,"Vote to end breed specific legislation. **update: remember to vote and do your own research rather than listening to biased comments in this discussion. We can not punish innocent dogs and responsible owners by keeping a ban that is proven to be ineffective! 🐶💕 Vote YES on 2J this November to end Denver’s ban on pit bulls and implement dog laws that focus on responsible dog ownership! Why? Breed specific legislation doesn’t make cities safer. Breed isn’t an indicator of whether or not a dog will bite- responsible ownership is. It is proven that pit bulls are not disproportionately dangerous compared to other dogs. Enforcing Denver’s ban on pit bulls has cost the city over $5.8 million. Denver already has rules in place about animal attacks, bites, and dangerous animals. Overall it is discriminatory against responsible owners and their dogs. Thousands of family dogs have been euthanized because of this ban. If you are interested in learning more, watch Beyond the Myth on amazon prime or reach out for more resources! New legislation: 1. All pit bulls will be required to be microchipped. 2. All pit bulls will be required to be spayed or neutered. 3. Only two pit bulls will be allowed per home. 4. Owners will be required to notify animal control if their dog escapes. 5. If after three years there are no issues, the pup will qualify for a standard dog license."

144,D9M_x-Nhj7Bh,Timothy Carter,Hale,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"Lawsuit Proceedings. On December 15th and 16th, 2020, Federal District 10 Judge Martinez will be hearing our case against the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for violating constitutional rights by sweeping people without homes and with nowhere to go - even in a global pandemic. This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housing - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, “The CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.”  On top of this the suit addresses that, “Over the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (“to where?” is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).” The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can’t afford housing during this pandemic.  Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that “when I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.” Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time.  Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. There will be a call-in number where the public can listen to the hearing. Stay tuned for this number. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to the hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place.  Contact: 720-940-5291"

After discussion and various requests for the man to leave, we called the police. Apparently two other neighbors also called the police because he was yelling so loud. He was likely mentally ill or on some sort of drug because he made little sense and spoke a lot about the presidential election as well as how much he liked our vehicle. He was carrying a sleeping bag and could have been homeless. The police came and put him in their car and later EMS showed up.

152,8ZnByc4ZH3N_,Giving Back,,21 Mar,"Today, March 21, is National Single Parent Day, a holiday honoring single moms and dads. This year it's more well-deserved than ever, with many singlehandedly juggling the day-to-day needs of their children with the unique challenges of parenting during a pandemic. 

But even those who do it all sometimes need the support of others. When that's the case, it's neighbors who often step up to help, assisting with basic needs, connecting them to local resources, and offering words of encouragement — a trend that's repeated itself again and again on Nextdoor.

➤ Michelle was living in a Chicago shelter last fall with her young daughter when she first turned to her neighbors, who supplied her with diapers, clothing, and a gift card for food. By March, she had posted an update: ""We begin our next journey and finally found an apartment and out of shelter life. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.""

 ➤ In Nitro, West Virginia, a mother of two was embarrassed to ask for help but was facing financial hardship and in need of basic supplies to get through the week. Neighbors not only provided her with milk, eggs, toilet paper, and bread, but with kind words and resources.

➤ Tara in Littleton, Colorado, put out a request for a ""random act of kindness"" for a homeless single dad and his 13-year-old son, who were sleeping in a heated garage. Within days, the community had secured him a phone, job leads, a vehicle, and temporary housing. ""My faith in humanity has been completely restored,"" she said. ""Our community is incredible!"""

156,sDuaShBZ9Hm7,Sara Henry,Cherry Creek North,23 Sep,"Email to Chris Hinds re: Group Living Zoning Amendment. Hello Teresa: As Chris and your office is well aware, the talk of the town and certainly the district that Chris represents is consumed with the proposed changes to the zoning laws that will effect almost all (not the lucky/privileged 20% that will be excluded) of our neighborhoods. The overwhelming majority of the people with whom I’ve spoken and as evidenced by the vast majority of opinions of the public, object to every aspect of the proposed changes as written as being beyond grossly excessive, prejudicial and dangerous to our communities. Many of the voters/citizens are absolutely willing to accept and support some of the changes that are reasonable, but the proposal as written is simply obscene. I was unable to attend the recent Zoom meeting hosted by Chris so I reached out via Nextdoor to ask which council members have publicly stated their positions in regards to the zoning changes. The response I received is that Chris is in favor of the entirety of the zoning changes as presented. Will you please tell us in writing where Chris stands on the most important issue that will affect our neighborhoods for years to come? Is he: 1) in favor of all of the proposed changes in their entirety; 2) in favor of some of the changes, and if so, which portion of the changes does he support/oppose and why; 3) in favor of delaying all of the proposed changes so further community input/evaluations can be made; or 4) in favor of allowing the citizens of Denver to vote on such a life-altering critical issue? Please provide us with a written response so that I can post Chris’s position on Nextdoor. The fact that this late in the game we are unsure of where our Denver City Council members presently stand on this issue is grossly unfair to the public that elected them. Sara A. Henry"

Thanks for everyone’s help and prayers in regards to my cousin Kathleen Lamb (Kat); who went missing around noon on Thursday. This is a message from Kat’s mom, Jennifer, this morning: I feel like I need to address a few things: Kathleen Lamb is not an ordinary homeless person. She has a home and a bed, and she has two beautiful girls that she loves. For the last ten years Kat has struggled with mental health issues. She had a severe breakdown this summer, and she has been in and out of psychosis. She was on a 72 hour hold and then was released to the Springs Rescue Mission, without the hospital ever speaking to me or to her case manager or to her therapist or doctor!!!. She did not want to come home. She said she had access to care. She had access to programs and she actually seemed to be thriving. We went down on Sunday to see her and to meet her boyfriend who is working and trying to get them into a better situation. In the last week and a half she began to decompensate. She still seemed okay the last time I spoke to her on duo. She can decompensate within hours, which we believe is what happened. We don’t know if she wandered off and was picked up or if she left with someone but she left her bag, her purse and her phone behind. She never leaves her phone. Not even in her worst condition. She also often carries her purse, even in this condition. The only thing missing is her wallet. And she has not used her cash card that I monitor since Monday. Our mental health system is so broken I have no words. They have made privacy laws so stringent that they put the responsibility of care with the person least capable of even caring for themselves. She does not have a street name. She is NOT your ordinary homeless person. She has friends and she has family who love her more than words can show."

They really are in a dire situation. I typically don’t like to just give cash out, but if we can get their car repaired and help them into some stable housing, this will be a game changer for them.

Effective for 30 days starting Sunday, November 8, all people in Denver should be home by 10 p.m., with certain exceptions, including going to and from work, interstate travel, and getting medical care. During this time, all public and private gatherings of people who are not members of a single household are prohibited, except for limited purposes. This is not intended to be a traditional curfew, but rather a restriction on gatherings, business hours, and a guidepost for behavior that will help Denver get through the next 30 days. Any business not defined as critical must close to the public during Home by 10 hours. Critical businesses include, but are not limited to, hospitals, grocery stores, and pharmacies. No alcohol sales or consumption after 10 p.m. will be permitted at any facility that sells alcohol, including restaurants and grocery and liquor stores. Restaurants will still be able to offer food takeout and delivery after 10 p.m. Under the new order, groups at restaurants will now be limited to six people from no more than two households, down from 10 people, for the duration of the Home by 10 public health order. Recreational athletic activities, including organized youth and adult league sports, practices, games, and tournaments, are prohibited. Spectators are prohibited at all post-secondary and Colorado High School Activities Association (CHSAA) sanctioned sporting events.

It's been heart warming to see our group grow to 30 members in less than a month! It's so good to see that our concerns are shared by others in the community , and that their are so many hands willing to work for good! We have seen over the past month alone over a dozen sweeps of our Unhoused neighbours numbering in the hundreds of people displaced again and again. Moved from block to block, having their belongings discarded, and thier rights violated. The winter is cold enough already , but the city has been colder still. City council refused last month to adjust spending for homelessness mitigation despite several diverse and well thought out community proposals, in favor of increases to funding for sweeps and police overtime. ( The public education budget for next year is slashed btw & the police department is getting an extra 45 million) Community volunteers have witnessed much over the past few months alone, police brutality, sexual assault by an officer , Hancocks excuses, city councils failure , and the displacement of hundreds more of our neighbours and friends due to the Covid related unemployment crises. But we have also made great strides together. We have a network of volunteers securing, storing, and preparing donations of food for sidewalk soup kitchen service, and soon we will have volunteers on the street every day to help feed and warm not just the homeless , but anyone who cares to stop , with a cup of warm soup or a hot coffee, to lessen the burden of their day. ( Interested in getting directly involved with sidewalk service ? Either securing donations , storing and preparing food and other goods, or helping with sidewalk service , please contact Cats Not Cops on Facebook or DM me for more info ) I apologize for a lack of updates on the sweeps that happened this week. For more consistent updates on sweeps and Denver Homeless Out Loud actions you can sign up for the email updates by emailing These emails are unformated, hand typed updates with no nonsense, advertising or repetitive calls for monitary donations. It's just raw , informative updates on the week to week of our action plan and their results. This week the sweep of 16th and Pearl was heartbreaking. We have fed this encampment each week for the past month. Over 150 people who could not be admitted to the new church sponsored safe outdoor space at 15th and Pearl were shuffled off to nowhere, losing possessions and losing more hope each time. I will make a post with updates on the action plan for next week as soon as I am privy."

Big dude ran up as he pulled in, ripped open the car door and starting punching him in the face and continued as he pulled him out. Took off w/ the car w/ super $$$$ bike and lots of accessories (helmet, wetsuit etc). WTF!! He is physically OK, a bit shell shocked. He is a very strong guy, but he was unable to overcome the 300 lb guy w/ the element of surprise (and his 2 hands on the outside door handle). Thank God there was no gun pulled!. The whole thing was caught on video and the 7-11 clerk saw the whole thing. Guy came out of nowhere, broad daylight. Cops came and report was filed, but unlikely to catch the guy or recover the car (and definitely not the bike). I’ve lived in this neighborhood 14 yrs and never heard of this happening, and never felt unsafe (and I am a woman, taking reasonable precautions I would take anywhere).

239,75XScXv8aaht,Sara Henry,Cherry Creek North,6 Sep,"Denver Group Living Change.org Petition. I received an email tonight setting forth details of various city council members' concerns about the rapid push to implement changes to the zoning code allowing up to 10 unrelated individuals and an unlimited number of their relatives to live in the same home. I was heartened to see numerous council members push back and ask numerous pointed questions of the planning department. Their concerns included: not enough time/input from the community especially during Covid, not enough analysis on whether this would actually hurt neighborhoods of color/low income, outside commercial interests pushing this to make more money, acknowledgment that literally there would be no cap on the number of people in one residence, 90% of public input thus far opposes the zoning change, exemptions will granted to about 25% of Denver areas forcing other areas to absorb more of the impact, etc. Bravo to the council members asking these critical questions before this kind of massive change is shoved down almost all of our throats without giving the voters/citizens of Denver the right to vote on such a life-impacting issue!! The notifications I'm receiving with these updates from keeps asking for donations to further the fight against this zoning change. Does anyone know where the money goes that's donated? I never donate to a cause unless I know who's getting that money and how it'll be spent. If anyone can answer this question I'd appreciate hearing from you."

I am starting this thread for a woman named Jan that responded to NEXTDOOR a couple of weeks ago expressing need for help but little detail. After pursuing that sub-posting and meeting her, I feel she merits some short term help. Although I encouraged her to write her own thread, she felt the potential of extensive response would be overwhelming. I have her consent to inform you about her needs. In short, she is middle aged and single with no family, disabled with a service dog, recovering from surgery, resumed work after 5 months unemployed due to pandemic, resourceful and humble. Her disability involves degenerative disk disease so lifting of weight is difficult. Her immediate needs are basic including replenishment of food supply, sundries, auto gas, utilities, and a few new clothing items due to long unemployment which precipitated substantial weight loss. Most of this she would prefer to obtain at Walmart due to modest prices. Walmart gift cards or cash would see these needs. In addition to her paid work, she sells some items on line such as clothing, purses, unopened facial creams, small household and garage items with limited weight. She is open to these donations. Unsold items are subsequently donated. Her other needs include a referral for a Therapist that takes MEDICAID as she is sometimes able to pay the difference in rates. She would need talk therapy for depression. Her face also lit up with the mention of the last item which would be a message with a professional able to accommodate her spinal condition. This might need to wait for the pandemic to subside around summertime as she is being quite careful. Any help as described, that you may provide would be greatly appreciated. You may also text message me at 612 666 5972 as that would be easier than following the thread on this site. I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to read and consider helping this person in need in our community. Sincerely, kris"

I am not the person who lost this dog, but I'm trying to help her spread the word to as many people as possible who may be able to help. Here is a link to her reddit post where she can be contacted. Update: She asks that anyone who wants to help or has information, please text her: 719-649-7239: Please read below: TLDR: my dog was claimed by a person experiencing homelessness roughly 400 ft from my house hours after getting loose in Cap Hill. Need as many eyeballs as I can get to locate him. If you read my previous posts, my dog was “claimed” by a person who sometimes stays in the encampment on 13th and Wash roughly two hours after he got loose from my house on 13th and Ogden. Over the last seven days, I have been to every shelter, several tent cities, resource centers, food banks and most churches that do hot food distribution to try and locate this guy. I have every homeless outreach team in the city and the Salvation Army “walkers” notified and on the look out and have flyered to bouncers and security guards who patrol businesses in the area. As of Friday morning, it was confirmed the man was seen with Huck, tearing down my flyers outside of the liquor store on Logan and Colfax. I’m working w an angel of an employee at Good Chem to try and get security footage so I could at least have a facial ID. If you live in the area and can help me look, that’s all I need...EYES. He goes up and down colfax, stays at the Y, Civic Center, and occasionally designated apartments and halfway houses near the Washington and 13th area. He’s a loner though, so most people I speak to can ID the dog but not him or his whereabouts. It’s also possible he has migrated to the Cherry Creek Trail or Platte River Valley Trail in advance of the impending city camp clean up so if you bike those, please be on the lookout. The guy is about 6 ft tall, has reddish blonde hair, is a middle aged ex vet who drinks and goes by John. He is calling my dog Babe and using a leather belt as a leash. People in the community who know this gentleman have suggested you do not approach. If you sight, please just contact me on here. I can be there ASAP with resources but even past sightings help so I can better narrow down his routines. My dog is a Black and Tan Aussie Shepherd/Aussie Kelpie mix w a black speckled tongue, brown eyes, erect ears, and a natural bob tail that is only four inches long. If you walk your dog on colfax or surrounding parks, please pay attention! He’s very social and would be likely to say “hi” to your puppy. There are pics in my previous posts. I’m devastated and desperate and have seen a lot of scary shit over the past couple of days...it hurts my heart that any living creature is experiencing these conditions, but selfishly I hate that my dog is currently living in and out of tent cities too and being around a lot of instability, hard drug use and violence. When I was flyering on Friday, I met a guy doing outreach who after a few minutes of conversation, determined that we think he owns Huck’s littermate. We got them from the same shelter at the same time from a big litter that came in and they look like twins. I feel trolled that I can find Huck’s literal brother in a five minute happenstance meeting but can’t locate the guy within a mile radius of my house who has him 😞.

257,ftmu53sr7Jpq,Larry Bell,Hilltop,15 Aug,"I want to share this letter. I wanted to share this letter. Councilman Kashmann: For forty-seven years I have made my home in Denver after returning from service in Vietnam. I was attracted to living in Denver because it had a renowned reputation for excellent neighborhood communities and spirit. I chose Congress Park as the neighborhood in which to live and raise my family, opting to send all three of our children to Denver Public Schools. I volunteered for years on the soccer fields, in the schools, in neighborhood organizations and in my downtown place of worship. While we as a family, and I as a practicing lawyer for over forty-four years, assisted those who struggled in our community to meet basic human needs, we felt safe and took pride in neighborhood activities. I moved to University Park fifteen years ago, when I needed to find a wheelchair accessible home for my daughter (a housing need not addressed or met by Denver's leadership) ; I have continued neighborhood participation and have run for office twice for the University Park area. I am therefore appalled and outraged by Denver City Council's apparent effort to disregard the efforts of homeowners and citizens to improve their neighborhoods and develop neighborhood spirit and cohesiveness - open to persons of all racial, ethnic, sexual preferences and social backgrounds, etc - by undermining the desire of all homeowners to live and raise families in safe, open and livable space, by destroying reasonable density and property use zoning with Group Living mandates. I was raised in the city of Philadelphia, have lived in a number of high density cities on the East and West Coast, and chose to move to Denver to put those less than desirable experiences behind me. There is no reason or justification to implant Group Homes with more than three unrelated persons - and their relatives - or Community Corrections half way housing or drug rehab facilities in neighborhoods where young children, play, ride their bikes and walk to school. As a defense attorney, I have first hand knowledge of the unsafe conditions that attend half way houses and drug rehab centers. No Denver resident should be unaware of the issues posed by current un-monitored ""camp sites"" in family centered neighborhoods, with attendant drug use, crime and health issues. At the same time, certain City Council politicians seek to defund the police and offer us the chaos and vandalism of downtown Denver; shame on them ! The Group Home approach reflects a lazy, non creative, and foolish approach to issues that demand intellect and commonsense - spread the problem and pander to certain ideologues and constituents, while doing nothing to address the mental illness, drug abuse, and hopelessness of those on the streets, or cramming more people into homes and neighborhoods where the infrastructure is lacking and the likelihood of those people becoming part of the community is next to nil. Denver is large enough to implement creative housing options and ""campsites"" that offer basic services and security, without trashing existing neighborhoods. Do citizens really want the unsafe and unhealthy circumstances of Civic Center Park and the downtown Denver Library to be superimposed on our safe neighborhoods? A resounding NO is the answer. Councilman Kashmann - represent your constituents and stop cowering to the radicals on City Council that are spearheading this destructive effort, that will lead to families leaving the City for safer neighborhoods. I will look for your leadership in the days ahead. Paul Linton, Esq. University Park."

263,z8kMxT33S8bP,Phillip Astein,South Park Hill,10 Jul,"A Sad Day In Denver. Dear Neighbors, Yesterday was a sad day in our beautiful city. An event occurred that I found to be quite egregious. At approximately 7PM I was at a red light at the intersection of Quebec and 35th. Coming across our path was a GMC Jimmy being pushed backwards into the intersection by a middle aged man. A Woman was in the drivers seat steering. It seemed they were hoping to get the broken down car into the neighborhood over by Brakes Plus. I live on Quebec street so it‘s not uncommon to see a fellow commuter dealing with a bad day and a broken car. Usually a Park Hill neighbor will come out and ask if everything is ok. This was different, this man was really struggling to push this car and as the car gained some momentum into the intersection he couldn’t keep up and promptly tripped and rolled on his back revealing a prosthetic leg. At this point the car was slowing in the middle of the intersection and the man was struggling to get up. Of course, our light had turned green. I jumped out of my car and ran to help push the car to the other side. The man stumbled over and said “thank you sir”. I looked back and all I saw was a bunch of mouth breathers in their cars at the intersection staring at me. W....T....F Denver? What happened? How am I the only one that helped these people. We’re a community! We can do better. Denver showed up in droves for the protests, put the BLM signs in the front yards but people can’t get out of your air conditioned car to help a fellow human!? Sad. If you are reading this you most likely weren’t at that intersection but my intention is to remind us all that moments like that, when you are the one in need and vulnerable, are the moments that make a city feel like a very lonely place. Keep an eye out for moments were you can change that please. Our city needs this. No comments necessary. Just something to meditate on."

As I've mentioned far too many times here, I love to homebrew beer. It's a hobby that I've really ramped up to get me through this time at home. This week I had a bucket of spent grain from a New England IPA I brewed. I posted on my local Nextdoor to see if anyone needed compost. Mel messaged me that she'd love to use the spent grain and hops to feed her backyard chickens. In exchange - she gave me some eggs (and I threw in a homebrewed wheat ale). I scrambled a few eggs yesterday - they're delicious and you can tell the difference from store bought! She texted me later that the chickens LOVED the grains. This is the beginning of another great partnership. What kind of neighborhood trades do you do? I'm in the mood to be inspired. I'm also considering launching a ""Good Neighbors"" segment on 9News weekends. Stay safe and stay healthy! - Steve"

279,q373NHwFSrYm,Timothy Carter,Hale,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"Arkins Sweep Update. For the past couple months police have been telling people who they sweep from other more visible downtown sites to go to Arkins. Now the City has come in to sweep them. To where??? Why not provide dumpsters with regular trash pick up? Why not provide port-a-potties (at least 1 for every 10 people)? And if not that...why not provide housing that residents of this camp can afford according to their info?  No, instead our City thinks sweeping 300 people to scatter to downtown blocks, down the river, or who knows where else is the answer. Yesterday was the second day of sweeps at the Arkins encampment. The previous night residents of the camp were told they could not get back into their property - some slept right outside the fence with what they had. Others scattered to who knows where without their property. Others were told they could go in, but if they came back out they could not get back in to get the rest of their property. In the morning, starting around 6am, the City started trashing property - indiscriminately scooping property with bulldozers and bobcats and crains. Anyone who had their property there but was not allowed in lost all their property. One of the only people who got their property yesterday was a woman we helped get back in to get her stuff just before they were about to trash it.  After the sweep yesterday, police went to numerous other camps around town - many where residents from Arkins moved to - telling them they could not be there under camping ban enforcement. People trying to move from the Arkins sweep were stopped from setting up at various camps - including cops threatening volunteers helping folks move with “illegal dumping” if they unloaded the person’s property.

280,uhArWPDN8evT,Nancy Bell,Hilltop,14 Aug,"I wanted to share this letter. Councilman Kashmann: For forty-seven years I have made my home in Denver after returning from service in Vietnam. I was attracted to living in Denver because it had a renowned reputation for excellent neighborhood communities and spirit. I chose Congress Park as the neighborhood in which to live and raise my family, opting to send all three of our children to Denver Public Schools. I volunteered for years on the soccer fields, in the schools, in neighborhood organizations and in my downtown place of worship. While we as a family, and I as a practicing lawyer for over forty-four years, assisted those who struggled in our community to meet basic human needs, we felt safe and took pride in neighborhood activities. I moved to University Park fifteen years ago, when I needed to find a wheelchair accessible home for my daughter (a housing need not addressed or met by Denver's leadership) ; I have continued neighborhood participation and have run for office twice for the University Park area. I am therefore appalled and outraged by Denver City Council's apparent effort to disregard the efforts of homeowners and citizens to improve their neighborhoods and develop neighborhood spirit and cohesiveness - open to persons of all racial, ethnic, sexual preferences and social backgrounds, etc - by undermining the desire of all homeowners to live and raise families in safe, open and livable space, by destroying reasonable density and property use zoning with Group Living mandates. I was raised in the city of Philadelphia, have lived in a number of high density cities on the East and West Coast, and chose to move to Denver to put those less than desirable experiences behind me. There is no reason or justification to implant Group Homes with more than three unrelated persons - and their relatives - or Community Corrections half way housing or drug rehab facilities in neighborhoods where young children, play, ride their bikes and walk to school. As a defense attorney, I have first hand knowledge of the unsafe conditions that attend half way houses and drug rehab centers. No Denver resident should be unaware of the issues posed by current un-monitored ""camp sites"" in family centered neighborhoods, with attendant drug use, crime and health issues. At the same time, certain City Council politicians seek to defund the police and offer us the chaos and vandalism of downtown Denver; shame on them ! The Group Home approach reflects a lazy, non creative, and foolish approach to issues that demand intellect and commonsense - spread the problem and pander to certain ideologues and constituents, while doing nothing to address the mental illness, drug abuse, and hopelessness of those on the streets, or cramming more people into homes and neighborhoods where the infrastructure is lacking and the likelihood of those people becoming part of the community is next to nil. Denver is large enough to implement creative housing options and ""campsites"" that offer basic services and security, without trashing existing neighborhoods. Do citizens really want the unsafe and unhealthy circumstances of Civic Center Park and the downtown Denver Library to be superimposed on our safe neighborhoods? A resounding NO is the answer. Councilman Kashmann - represent your constituents and stop cowering to the radicals on City Council that are spearheading this destructive effort, that will lead to families leaving the City for safer neighborhoods. I will look for your leadership in the days ahead. Paul Linton, Esq. University Park."

The new place won't be ready until 6/15, so I am trying to find temporary housing for about 2 weeks for us 3 humans and 2 big dogs. Hotels that allow dogs are plentiful, but too expensive right after putting down everything I have to get into our new place. If anyone has an idea on a solution, please contact me via this thread or PM. Also, looking for MOVING HELP for this Saturday, 5/30... Thanks to All! - Allison Hello my fellow Denver neighbors. I am posting as a final effort to reach out before my family faces homelessness on June 1st. If you or someone you know has a 3 bedroom house/condo/duplex for rent, or any resources for a family in need of permanent shelter, that I have monthly income to pay for, please, please contact me through Nextdoor or email . I am a single mom of two boys and we have two trained and friendly adult female Great Danes, one is eldery. We have been living in rental homes for years, but due to the pandemic, we are struggling to find a home that fits us all within my $2K-$2,500/mo budget for rent. Our lease is up in our current home near Lindsley Park, and we have had several applications I've put in this month denied. Some of you may recognize me from Nextdoor as your neighbor, or your Nanny, or your trusted dogsitter and housesitter. I have been active in our community in all these roles, and have strong neighborhood references to back me up. I have congestive heart failure from the open heart surgery I received in 2015 to replace the aortic valve in my heart and save my life. I am disabled, however, thanks to the support of my boys Evan-15 and Noah-11, I lead a modified yet active and fulfilling life with them and our girls (the Danes). My oldest son is a bike mechanic that has been active in our community as well, having fixed up donated bikes to resell, or provide tune ups and repairs to our neighborhood. My youngest son is an avid and talented artist and performs the brunt of our household chores, from dishes to picking up poop on a daily basis, he keeps our household neat and tidy. I am in digital marketing sales and work remotely from home as a self contracted employee for 6 months until I am hired on permanently. The three of us function like a well oiled machine, we are a tight and unified family unit. Here's why we have been denied applications for rental homes this month. My credit is shot due to recent divorce, from an abusive and alcoholic ex husband who wouldn't work, my boys' father. We left him and his dysfunctional family in Dallas and moved to Denver, where I grew up, to start a fresh life for ourselves. Also, even though we have strong rental, personal and pet references, landlords are concerned that we are not a two adult income household and/or they do not allow large dogs. I have also been denied because of my health issues and recent job changes, due to the pandemic, these past few months. Even though I don't look as good on paper as other applicants, I was hoping to find a decent human who would extend some faith and trust in my little family, I have income, and I have first month's rent and security deposit ready to go, if someone would just give us a chance. Thanks for reading, and I hope someone can provide some information or assistance to us before it is too late."

He busted my window in, and I yelled at him to get away from my car through my apartment window and he took off running and luckily with no items. The strange part? I had absolutely nothing valuable in my car, nor did I have anything in my car out in plain sight besides my fold up massage table (I'm an esthetician) The motive was strange; as he made a lot of noise and drew attention to himself. This is just a warning, it happened to another neighbor in the same building. Make sure you don't leave valuables inside your car- break ins are happening left and right. I spent my entire Saturday getting the window fixed. I have reported this information to the police. Description of person involved – Hair: short dark hair, Top: red windbreaker, Bottom: jeans, Age: mid 30s? Early 40s?, Sex: Male"

320,qNuGmMyUgG3h,Betsy Rumely,Congress Park,19 Aug,"Halfway houses in neighborhoods—not equity, despite Webb’s claim. What I strongly suspect has happened is that the land zoned for halfway houses was taken over by developers in areas, such as LoHi. So now rather than plan for the displacement of halfway houses and save some land for the halfway houses in land zoned for that, the developers took all sites away. So the City’s great solution? Rezone residential areas and fill neighborhoods with people on probation, create safety risks, and degrade home values. People in halfway houses are on probation; they have not, as Webb claims, paid their debt to society. Rather they have been released early, so that they can attempt to prove that they can function safely in society. They have not proved that they deserve to live wherever they want, despite Andrew Webb’s claim that this is equity. And notice how the recidivism rate is never discussed. As with most things currently underway in our city with this administration, follow the money. The money was in pushing halfway houses out of LOHI to allow large scale redevelopment. I have a close family member who has been in halfway houses—in LOHI; these places no longer exist, and believe me, you don’t want those folks as neighbors. Not yet."

336,Hky5Lt9nLwjC,Jean Greenwood,Hilltop,17 Aug,"Oppose Amending Group Living Code. I am opposed to the zoning change to increase density in Denver neighborhoods. Instead of working with developers, city planners and lenders to build more affordable housing, some members of the City council have expressed support for the lazy option of just cramming more people into existing homes. This zoning change has the potential to ruin existing single-family neighborhoods. The amendment would increase the number of unrelated adults who can live together to eight or more. Individual family homes could be turned into boarding houses for week-to week and month-to-month renters. Properties could be turned into group living facilities for the homeless, community corrections (halfway houses) and special care. As the number of residents’ increase, so does the number of cars, noise, overcrowding and safety problems. What is behind this zoning change? In a word, money. It has been reported that many of the Group Living Advisory Committee (GLAC) members have ties to for-profit group living businesses and organizations. These for-profit groups are not concerned about Denver neighborhoods. Instead their motivation is increasing the number of people landlords can legally charge rent to. Measures comparable to what GLAC is proposing has been passed in other cities. In those cities, single-family homes were purchased by investors who turned them into dormitory-like dwellings and group living facilities. And what was the result in these cities? Neighborhoods were ruined as renters moved in and homeowners moved out. Members of the Denver council have a choice to make. Are you going to protect single-family neighborhoods or ruin them? Are you going to stand with Denver homeowners or investors? Do the right thing and vote to not amend the Group Living Code. Ned Greenwood Hilltop"

I'm 76 so I pretty much need to observe. I just dropped off a UPS return at the store on 700 Colo. Blvd. I saw that an extreme minimum of the distancing guidelines are being observed there. The lobby is very small so there's an absolute minimum of space for 6' distancing, clerks are not wearing masks and there are no other forms of barriers, and, a steady stream of observing and non-observing customers are coming in one after the other. This caught my attention because I've been to many other local businesses that are doing a good job of keeping their customers safe and it's much appreciated. In those stores, you can at least assume that they try to clean and disinfect regularly. However, in this UPS store, I got no such feeling and they deal with a lot of customers each day. My recommendation is that if you need to ship, that you shop around for other UPS stores locally that observe a higher level of citizenship toward their customers"

With the year end approaching, I want to make everyone aware of Energy Outreach Colorado, where I am a member of the board. EOC is a nonprofit organization with the mission of making sure that all Coloradans can afford their energy needs. We work extensively with the State of Colorado and all major utilities around the state. In this pandemic year, more Coloradans are struggling financially and help with their energy costs can make a big difference in their lives and, in many cases, keep a family from homelessness. If you are struggling with your energy bills this winter, please visit the EOC website () to see if you might qualify for assistance. If you are fortunate enough to be in a position to help your neighbors with their energy costs, I would ask you to consider EOC in your year-end giving. Colorado Gives Day is coming on December 8th, and that’s a great way to donate, or you can donate directly on the EOC website. We’re also listed on Amazon Smile, and if you can select us there, Amazon will make a small donation with each of your purchases. Winter is coming fast and the pandemic is already here. It’s a scary thing to be on the edge of energy poverty and have to make decisions about whether to pay for food, medicine, or electricity. If you can help, please do. Thank you."

If you are facing any of the following barriers to vaccine access, we have services and resources to help. ... I can’t get an appointment. Vaccine supply doesn’t currently meet the demand in our community, and appointments can be hard to come by.

There are also many resources available online and by phone to help you find an appointment or get on a waitlist for providers in your area.

The COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in preventing infection. All vaccines available in the U.S. are nearly 100% effective in preventing serious illness and death related to the virus.

I know that everyone has their favorite automotive repair place but I want to give a shout out to Paris Automotive and Tire at Leetsdale and Oneida. Jim Paris, at one time, had several stores but after he passed away most closed, but the family sold this one to Jeff Stone, the manager at the time. I have known Jeff from taking my cars into him when he worked at a Michelin place on Bannock St. in the late 70's. Jeff then worked for Jim Paris at the current location and bought it many years ago. He has stayed open and applied for a small business loan as soon as they were available but still was too late as the money ran out. There is not a more honest, personable, capable, person out there, no matter what you think of your person. One time I had an issue with some part and it was out of warranty. Jeff sent me a check to reimburse me notwithstanding that he owed me nothing. He knows all his customers by first name and always has a smile. He needs your work now. Few people are driving so when the stay at home order expires, no one will need oil changes, new tires and other automotive repairs (he does almost everything not just tires) for some time. Please think of Jeff and his loyal employees-- he is paying them, and somehow keeping them working, albeit little business and he doesn't expect business to pick up for some time. Please support your local independent business person and not the chains. If you tell Jeff I referred you, I will get nothing, you will get great service with no discount and maybe even a higher bill because you know me. There is no other business I have ever given as much money to over the years and felt good about it. Please don't tell him that or he will end up owning my first born son."

Dear Friend of Goodwill, Like many Coloradans, Goodwill has demonstrated its ability to adapt to a fast-changing landscape. The COVID-19 pandemic facing the country has had a profound impact on charitable organizations like Goodwill to provide services in an unprecedented manner. We cannot do this without you! Please donate today! Goodwill is more than a retail store; it is a crucial resource that provides workforce development programs to our community, and our services are needed now more than ever as many of our neighbors face significant financial hardships. The closing of our retail locations has led to a perilous loss in revenue. Your support is needed now more than ever. Goodwill continues to donate clothing to shelters for homeless individuals, and is laundering and donating medical scrubs. In addition, we are continuing many of our mission programs to help individuals achieve greater independence—especially important during these uncertain times. Most recently, Goodwill has begun to collect PPE and canned goods at our store donation centers for Colorado's Office of Emergency Management. Your financial contribution will aid in our ability to continue to meet the needs of our community. Please show your support and give now to help Goodwill extend our mission to more Coloradans. Your generosity will help individuals stay healthy and safe, and experience greater independence. We deeply appreciate your support, thank you! ﻿Sincerely, Karla Grazier, President and CEO"

Like many people in healthcare, I scoffed at those taking this now pandemic so seriously when it seemed like the flu is serious every year and we can't even get people to get their flu shot or wash their hands. We were given tables of data showing how the flu has a higher mortality rate and initially looked at this like it was just another thing. But now it is very clear that this is not going away. And it has the potential to completely overwhelm our healthcare system. I don't say any of this to encourage or condone panic. Panic and hoarding is the last thing that anyone should do. Let's all come together and help the most vulnerable among us. Starting tomorrow 3/16 we will deliver any prescriptions for free. We will work with your insurance company to get longer day supplies if needed. We will be posting on social media whenever we get vital supplies in like hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies. And we would like to coordinate volunteers for grocery shopping for folks that need it. We will regularly wipe down all surfaces at the pharmacy and do our best to keep it as safe as possible. What else can we do for you Congress Park??? Tell us the need and let's all solve it together. I'm already aware of one need. For doctors, pharmacists, nurses, etc....anyone on the front lines....we need help with our kids. And we can't have a ton of kids at one place because that defeats the purpose of social distancing to flatten the curve. So if you have a neighbor that's a first responder that has to go to work, and you yourself are not a vulnerable population, offer to help that family. This is a vital contribution you could be making if you are not able to work and are healthy. How else can we all think to help?? I'm so interested to hear your responses. And please, feel free to call and ask for help. I have so many wonderful patients that want to help others. We can connect people with the resources they need.

The Denver Police Department (DPD) is requesting the community’s assistance in identifying and locating a suspect in a pattern of sexual assaults. Since 2013, there have been several incidents where a man, possibly posing as a driver in the lower downtown area, sexually assaults males in his vehicle. Through the investigative process, Denver Police believes these sex assaults are related. It appears that the male suspect targets men who are walking alone in the lower downtown area, around the time that the bars are closing (1:30-3:00 a.m.). In cases being investigated, it does not appear that the suspect is targeting the men based on their sexual preference. The suspect is described as a Hispanic male with dark or salt and pepper colored hair, a high-pitch voice, who speaks both English and Spanish with an accent. While the vehicle description has changed during the years, the most recent description is a tan minivan. Due to the lengthy timeframe of the reported incidents, the Denver Police Department is concerned that there may be additional victims who have not reported the assault. Therefore, victims are strongly encouraged to contact DPD by calling the Denver Police Department’s Sex Crime Unit at 720-913-6040, or by visiting , where they can report the sexual assault online, including anonymously, and find out about other resources. Additionally, anyone with information about the suspect, is asked to call 720-913-7867, where they can remain anonymous. *DISCLAIMER: If this is an emergency, please call or text 911.

As I told you before Clara got a night job for a subcontractor that cleans the RTD trains. Thanks to you all We have been able to keep her in the Shepard’s Motel for the time being! The bad news is that the 1st night of the snowstorm last week, someone hit Clara on her way to work while she was driving on I70 around Colorado Blvd. Clara went into a ditch and long story short it totaled her car! We are devasted by that setback. Clara spent the night in the hospital while they checked her out. Luckily, she is fine. Clara gets her first paycheck next week which I think will be less than $500. She is putting the check down on another car from a dealer on Colfax. They are also taking her old car I guess to sell the parts as part of the deal. Right now, I desperately need $335.00 to pay for another week at the motel which will be due Saturday. Prior -Update 10/19/19 Need some immediate help for Clara. Looks like she has a job but yesterday her car got a flat tire at some Safeway on Havana. I need somebody to help her get a good used tire, pick her up and take her over and get her on the road. I can reimburse you for the tire. I know Discount Tires sells good used tires for approx $25. Is anyone available that would like to help? Hi all! I wanted to post an update regarding Clara and Coco's situation. I personally want to thank all that have given and ask that those considering to please help us. We have enough funds to keep Clara & Coco in the motel for 1 more week. The jobs that told Clara they would hire her once she was mobile did not come through. She has applied to all the agencies in Denver that offer help to the homeless including Tanif the federal Sec 8 program. She has also applied to 26 companies and possibly will have a job on Monday. It is critical that we keep her in the motel until the Job comes through and we have a chance to save up the security deposit and 1st months rent. She is looking for an apartment that is low cost $800/mo or less in the case that Tanif or Sec 8 (which is a lottery) doesn't come through. Please help me help Clara.. She is a wonderful, positive, drug free, die hard German. Her parents were immigrants. She is not a taker. I make her call me once a day to give me an update because I found after a stretch of not hearing from her she went 3 days without food because she ""didn't want to bother me.""

Grabbing a free gun lock and securing a weapon is one action we can all take right now to keep young people safe.” To get a lock, check with these Safe Haven locations: New Hope Ministries of Central Denver, 90 Knox Ct. 720-276-4972 New Beginnings Ministries, 5200 Tejon St. 720-323-4334 His Love Fellowship, 910 Kalamath St. 720-422-0557 Anchor of Hope, 2101 N.

You can give through this link if you prefer. Bless you all for what you have done so far. https://www.gofundme.com/help-clara-and-coco-get-a-permanent-home Update 9/20/19 - Hi everyone. I wanted to let you know what is new in the last couple days. Thanks to Tim Townsend's advice, Clara was able to enter her application for Section 8 housing.. Clara also starts her new job on Monday full-time. I will finally get the GoFundMe page up this weekend because many would prefer to give that way :) Also canted to thank and let whoever dropped the Target card and 2 bags of dog food and treats on my front porch, that I received it and Clara is dropping by my office to pick it up today. She was so appreciative. That is it for now. Update 9/17/19 - I hope you check the New photo of Clara and Coco!!!! Clara has on a new outfit that she bought with fund from your generosity so she could make a great impression for her interview yesterday for the new better paying job at the warehouse that had been holding a job for her. Clara and I are going to talk tomorrow about plans for a transition into affordable housing. We are still receiving your generous donations as the goal is to get her in an affordable apartment.. This little lady is a fighter.. I knew when I met her there was something special about Clara.. I found out that she is also a cancer survivor. Also having 4 brothers made her tough! I will give you another update in a couple days. Thank you All so much! Update 9/12/19 9:48pm - I have an amazing update! Clara went into the employer that has been holding her job to let them know she is available to work again. So Sit Down - the woman she meets with tells her she has another job that has opened up that she wants Clara to interview for. It is a higher paying job handling employee health insurance issues! This all seems so surreal and we are all part of it.... Update 9/12/19 - CLARA IS MOBILE!!!! Thanks to one of you Good Samaritan's that came and made sure her car was to go. As Monday is the deadline for the work I am doing I have limited time to post til Tuesday although I will respond in the evening or when I take a break. For those that want to help with her stay I will PM you the information. For the other offers, You can mail or drop off gift cards, checks etc to me and I will see she gets them. I did notice that her tires are bald so that is another fund you can give too. :) Update When I drove to work yesterday, I brought a coffee to my friend that is homeless and living with her dog. Her name is Clara and she lives in her car. Her car was not running and I have been trying to help her as I can. So have several of you wonderful neighbors. She told me that a veterinary office brought her food for Coco not sure if it was a result of my prior post or not but Thank you if you see this. She is living behind King Soopers at Tennessee and Niagra if you want to help. I think that she still may need some help with the air compressor installation. Clara is very smart, has all her teeth (no drugs) and talked to me about reconciling accounts last week (smart cookie). She also scrimped and saved and bought the part she needed for the car, the air conditioning compressor. She got on You Tube and learned how to replace her bad one! I was amazed. As I drove up today, she was sitting in her car (up on blocks that other homeless men help place because she had to take her tire off to get to the compressor) hood up and crying, big tears rolling down her face. I asked her what was wrong and some homeless jerk had come by 10 min before and stole her wrench when she was almost done! How hopeless she must have felt... We were right next to my office so I told her to come over and I had a tool box and we would see if I had one. Sure enough I had the one she needed. I found out that she has a job in a warehouse once she gets the car running. Through Clara's example I thought about the year I have gone through and realized it was nothing compared to the test Clara is living through. She is happy and grateful and a trooper and told me that she wakes up everyday thinking about how she can meet the needs of CoCo her dog. I collected money for her and have it in savings. She knows I am holding it for her.. If anyone wants to help, let me know. Also I work 7 days a week right now so if someone want to help me set up a GoFundMe page I would welcome the help.."

469,JXzTPQEkvWQr,Olga Guerra,Hale,10 Apr 19,"Initiative 300, the “Right to Survive”. I want to encourage folks to read the important book, “Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City”. The book is a close-up look at several families caught in the revolving door of evictions and downward mobility into worse housing and neighborhoods, all while their landlords do quite well. It is a thoroughly researched examination of the issues leading up to homelessness and it’s psychological and behavioral impacts as well as its impact on our neighborhoods and the costs to the court system. It’s a web of systemic problems that desperately needs to be addressed. We need to demand that our civic leaders tackle this head-on, neither sweeping it under the rug by arresting folks sleeping on the streets, nor entrenching it by allowing the broken system to keep chewing up and spitting out human beings, while permitting them freeze to death without being hassled. So, the question to our mayoral and city council candidates should be not, “Do you support Initiative 300?”, but rather, “How much have you studied the systemic causes of homelessness and what will you do to address them?” We should not settle for the simplistic, “I’ll add 200 more beds” etc. No number of “beds” will begin to touch the problem."

Building on previous actions to ensure Denver city employees and many city service contract employees are paid a minimum wage of $15 per hour by 2021, Mayor Michael B. Hancock and Robin Kniech, Denver City Council At-Large intend to introduce legislation this fall to set a citywide minimum wage for all workers employed in Denver beginning Jan. 1, 2020. This year, Denver set a higher minimum wage for city employees and contractors. During this year’s legislative session, through HB19-1210, the Colorado General Assembly authorized local governments to set a citywide minimum wage greater than the state constitutional wage, currently $11.10 an hour and scheduled to go to $12 on Jan. 1. Utilizing this new authority, Mayor Hancock and Councilwoman Kniech’s proposal would elevate Denver’s minimum wage to $13.80 on Jan. 1, $15.87 on Jan. 1, 2021, and then rise according to the Consumer Price Index each year after that. The city is hosting several community meetings throughout October to gather input and feedback from Denver residents on the proposal. City Council is expected to consider the proposal in November.

Este año, Denver estableció un salario mínimo más alto para los empleados y contratistas de la ciudad. Durante la sesión legislativa de este año, a través de HB19-1210, la Asamblea General de Colorado autorizó a los gobiernos locales a establecer un salario mínimo en toda la ciudad mayor que el salario constitucional estatal, actualmente $ 11.10 por hora y programado para llegar a $ 12 el 1 de enero.

Our family cat, Apple, is 12 years old and has spent the last 6 months inappropriately urinating on clothing, rugs, she took out the guest bed, and last night she urinated on our bed. We have had her since she was a kitten. She’s originally from Buffalo, NY; then lived with us in NYC, then we moved to Avon, CO, then a condo in Denver, and we’ve been in our family home for 7 years. I give the background as she has had change in her life before and tolerated it well. Apple tends to enjoy affection only from my husband. For the past 10 years, if I attempt to pet her longer for two minutes, she claws me. We have a six year old whom Apple has never been fond of no matter how hard that child tries. When our baby was 5 months old, Apple seriously scratched her face, at that point we should have removed her from the home. I have visited the vet with her numerous times last November to figure out the urination issue, medically she’s great! She calms down with a healthy dose of Xanax, she refuses any other medication. Her diet has been consistent for 12 years. She has a cat castle and free range of the home. Her liter box is scooped out twice daily and in a relatively low traffic area, our bathroom. She’s an indoor cat with the exception on nice weather, then she ventures into the yard. We have a 3 year old Border Collie and the interactions between cat and dog are hostile at best, and now they avoid each other. Lastly, we have another baby due in August and we feel Apple will completely loose her mind. Any suggestions would be great, we are open to all options: surrendering her, finding her a new home, ideas to confine her at home, anything at all! Thanks for reading..."

If you are seeking a way to give locally this holiday season, I'd like to encourage you to consider the amazing high school for which I sit on the Board, the Academy of Urban Learning (AUL Denver). AUL’s Principal, Jennifer Jackson, lives in Park Hill and leads a remarkable staff in offering trauma-informed instruction to students who have experienced many barriers to academic success. You can read more about the school at . Many of AUL’s students are currently homeless and/or attempting to support themselves independently (working full-time in addition to attending school everyday). We are always on the lookout for gently used coats that can be provided to our students, as well as new socks to keep them warm during this cold season. We are also hoping to alleviate financial burdens of our AUL community with gift cards to local grocers and other retailers to meet the basic needs of our students and their families. To support this effort, I am collecting gift cards for the following: King Soopers, Safeway, Walmart, Target, Auto Zone, and gas stations. All donations are tax deductible, and the school can provide a form with its tax ID number if needed. No gift amount is too small! If you would like to deliver donations directly to the school, you can drop them off or address them to the following: Erin Pier c/o AUL Denver 2417 W. 29th Ave Denver, CO 80211 For convenience, you can also drop donations off on my front porch/mailbox at 1129 Jasmine St. I will make a delivery to the school at the end of next week (12/13) with any items I receive. If you would like additional information about the school or this fundraising initiative before contributing, please contact me personally and I will happily answer your questions."

I heard that we are all in the same boat, but it's not like that. We are in the same storm, but not in the same boat. Your ship could be shipwrecked and mine might not be. Or vice versa. For some, quarantine is optimal. A moment of reflection, of re-connection, easy in flip flops, with a cocktail or coffee. For others, this is a desperate financial & family crisis. For some that live alone they're facing endless loneliness. While for others it is peace, rest & time with their mother, father, sons & daughters. With the $600 weekly increase in unemployment some are bringing in more money to their households than they were working. Others are working more hours for less money due to pay cuts or loss in sales. Some families of 4 just received $3400 from the stimulus while other families of 4 saw $0. Some were concerned about getting a certain candy for Easter while others were concerned if there would be enough bread, milk and eggs for the weekend. Some want to go back to work because they don't qualify for unemployment and are running out of money. Others want to kill those who break the quarantine. Some are home spending 2-3 hours/day helping their child with online schooling while others are spending 2-3 hours/day to educate their children on top of a 10-12 hour workday. Some have experienced the near death of the virus, some have already lost someone from it and some are not sure if their loved ones are going to make it. Others don't believe this is a big deal. Some have faith in God and expect miracles during this 2020. Others say the worst is yet to come. So, friends, we are not in the same boat. We are going through a time when our perceptions and needs are completely different. Each of us will emerge, in our own way, from this storm. It is very important to see beyond what is seen at first glance. Not just looking, actually seeing. We are all on different ships during this storm experiencing a very different journey.

What a great concept! You can check Mike's website at to be sure of the locations and times of his truck;usually he's at Colfax and Macon three days a week but he'll be in Civic Center Park on Monday, November 11th to celebrate Veteran's Day. If you have a chance, check him out ....his sandwiches are totally delicious. My favorite is the Reuben (East Coast corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese,1000 Island dressing and rye bread)...yum. Michael does catering so think about Full Battle Rattle Deli for your next party or football gathering.He's a great guy and working for a very worthy cause, don't you think?"
497,6t3LXzmnfcBC,Bradly Anderson,South Park Hill,10 Apr 20,"Park Hill (N and S) listed among neighborhoods with highest infection rates. Interesting! Park Hill just got listed as one of the Denver neighborhoods with the highest infection rates. Yet, I still see groups of kids walking by my house daily. I still see groups of neighbors congregating on yards, as if it’s the perfect time for a block party. My girlfriend and I both have small businesses that are closed due to this. They say May 1st, but that still seems unrealistic. I know several of you are in the same position. We do our absolute best to practice social distancing. Haven’t seen our families or friends since this started, haven’t been able to work. None of this “let’s hang out but stay 6 feet away lol.” Which, I think is a pretty poor excuse for a work-around. Every day I see my neighbors doing this is another day that my shop has to stay closed. It is another day that we, as a collective, cannot work towards a functional life again. Yes, “the curve is flattening.” No, this isn’t over. When all of your favorite businesses start to close, and everyone around you starts getting sick, just remember—all you had to do was put selfishness aside and deal with a sucky few weeks. I know so many of my neighbors have been doing their part, and I commend you for that. But, for those who aren’t (and believe me, we all see you): Stop. If ignorance is bliss, then some of you must really be the happiest people on the planet."

499,by5TBPtwGSYp,Bernie Decker,Mayfair,8 Jun,"2020 NAS-Lowry Mask Project. New America School-Lowry 2020 Mask Project The week of finals may not be the best time to initiate a student-based program requiring effort and action, but that is precisely what graduating seniors and underclassmen at New America School (NAS-Lowry) have done. Students and staff of the high school at Lowry Campus, have put together and implemented a plan to provide reusable masks for the Aurora Emergency Respite Center, a hotel/hospice supported by Aurora government and managed by Director of Homelessness, Shelley McKittrick. “I make these masks because I found it useful right now,” explains graduating senior Guomalo Diallo, born in the town of Guediawaye, Senegal, West Africa. The soft-spoken, thoughtful young man continues, “sewing is something I like, it's like a culture for me, it's something I like and I did it, I hope it will be useful.” Diallo came to the United States and New America School in 2018. He excels in mathematics and the sciences and sees himself, “becoming an entrepreneur and running my own business in five years.” No doubt! The cohort at the high school were quick to respond the project: “Our students didn’t even wait for materials,” informs NAS-Lowry’s principal, Dr. Cynthia Trinidad-Sheahan, “they made the masks right away. The students know how urgent it is for our community.” The 2020 NAS-Lowry Mask Project will make its first donation of more than 100 masks to Aurora Emergency Respite Center this week and as the students are well-into the action, the project anticipates further contributions to the cause."

502,fQjmf2a8TxEs,Polly Reetz,Cherry Creek North,2 Apr 19,"CHL position on 300. Statement From Providers On Initiative 300 By newspaper537 / April 01, 2019 / News ‘Divisive Policies And Campaigns Do Not Make Our Community Stronger’ Editor’s Note: On March 6, the Colorado Homeless Leadership Council released a statement regarding Initiative 300, the Right to Survive. The groups noted they were not taking a formal position, and explained why. Here is their statement: As service providers and advocates for those people who are experiencing homelessness, our perspective on the issue at hand is unique. Therefore, we feel compelled to weigh in and express our concerns because the impact of the initiative and the “no” campaign is doing a disservice to the dignity each and every member of our community, including those who are experiencing homelessness, deserve. It is our opinion that the impact of the campaign, and then the implementation of the initiative, if approved by the voters, are both detrimental to our clients and our community. According to the most recent campaign finance disclosures, Together Denver has already raised $588,784 to promote their position and campaigns are likely to raise significantly more. Campaign contributions have come from local businesses, business advocacy groups, professional associations and individuals. As a group we are disappointed that this costly campaign means that financial resources are being diverted from services, and further stigmatizing people experiencing homelessness, instead of investing in the multitude of real solutions that our organizations are providing daily. Collectively, we see increased need for shelter, housing and support services, including unique subpopulations such as women, individuals with cross-disabilities, youth, seniors and LGBTQ populations. The truth is that we are under-resourced and underfunded to scale appropriately to meet demand. While Initiative 300, The Right to Survive, would decriminalize certain essential behaviors of people experiencing homelessness, the possible unintended consequences are far reaching. We are concerned that if the initiative becomes law, it will lower the prevailing standard of human welfare in our community potentially reducing the expectation of ‘need’ met by our human service organizations, community members and government. Instead the focus will be sheer physical survival in outdoor spaces that are not suitable for human habitation. This minimal concept of ‘survival’ provided by the initiative offers little to improve the welfare or security of the unsheltered homeless community in Denver. Individuals experiencing homelessness will remain susceptible to volatility of life on the streets—exposed to extreme climate, violence, injury, exploitation, and even death. The HLC believes there are more narrowly tailored policy alternatives that would protect individuals experiencing homelessness from discrimination, enhance their trust of law enforcement and service providers, and reduce interactions with the criminal justice system. As our community responds to the current crisis we witness on the streets and throughout our agencies, the HLC and our respective organizations are committed to a coordinated approach, and to expanding a full continuum of services that are proven to address the complex, but solvable challenge of members of homelessness. Such services include: • Appropriate shelter • Affordable housing • Permanent supportive housing • Support services including behavioral health, workforce development, and increasing employment and income opportunities The HLC asks that the business community, the city and county of Denver, the voters and our community members further invest in housing, shelter and supportive services. Then join us in enhancing the solutions that are working to end homelessness in Denver. Additionally, we respectfully request that the opponents of Initiative 300 commit to halting the divisive, traumatizing, and stigmatizing activities and campaigns that demonize and disrespect the inherent dignity of all people in our community. An increased commitment to provide financial resources, community will, collaboration, and policy reform by the city and county of Denver, homeless service providers, housing developers, the business community, neighborhood groups, the faith community, and others seeking long-term solutions will provide a true alternative to the need for a Right to Survive. We recognize that many Denver citizens are eager to contribute personally to solutions, beyond the proposed ballot measure. It takes our entire community to improve the lives of those at risk who depend on our support so they can thrive. To that end, we encourage individuals to connect with local service providers in their neighborhoods and across the metro area. We ask that our community takes immediate action and join us as donors, volunteers and advocates in support of one of our communities’ most vulnerable populations. Divisive policies and campaigns do not make our community stronger, more welcoming, nor do they improve the welfare for all of us. Respectfully, The Denver Homeless Leadership Council The HLC is comprised of the following organizations: Catholic Charities of Denver, Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, The Delores Project, Denver Rescue Mission, The Gathering Place, St. Francis Center, The Salvation Army, Urban Peak and Volunteers of America.

503,CuSUjrRts8y3,Tim Rathmann,Congress Park,17 Dec 19,"Harrison Street Alley between 7th & 8th Avenue. Hello neighbors, I recently experienced suspicious activities in our alley at early hours in the morning and wanted to share it with you. I left for work at 3am on Friday morning and at 2am on Sunday morning. At both times, I heard someone running away when they heard the sound of my garage door or back gate opening. We have stories of homeless people defecting in the alley behind our house also. It’s dark in the alley and they obviously felt that no-one could see them. Disgusting! I also park my vehicle behind our house in the alley because the wheels and tires were stolen recently in front the my house. See attached photo! I feel that parking it in the back would be safer. I installed a security camera and Xcel Energy recently mounted a street lamp which we really liked. It illuminated the dark alley and made us feel safer. My wife felt a lot safer when she had to walk the dog independently when I was not at home. Well, Xcel Energy recently removed the street lamp in the alley and we feel unsafe again. I contacted them and they said that the City requested that Xcel to remove the street lamp. Does anybody know how to go about getting our alley illuminated and the street lamp re-installed so it’s safer? I have already contacted Xcel Energy and have reached out to Chris Hinds, the Council 10 representative, with this and would love to get anyone else’s input. We need our alleys illuminated! Thank you for reading this message. Feel free to contact me via a private message or through text, phone call or email. 562-519-0659 or Tim Vehicle 1 Color: Black Make: Chevy Model: Tahoe Year: 2015 Type: SUV I have reported this information to the police."

506,wN6ECCjVPRCg,Karen Hjerleid,South Park Hill,21 Mar 20,"Let’s let the seniors and immuno compromised get their groceries delivered. I think we have things backwards folks - instead of giving senior citizens an hour in the morning to shop in the grocery stores, let’s truly protect their safety to the best of our ability and ask that people don’t use grocery delivery unless they themselves are sick or are a senior. There are currently no delivery times open due to high demand - I believe it would be a much more compassionate and appropriate way to organize ourselves as a community to reserve this precious service for the folks who need it the most."

Yes, people will be able to camp on any public space including parks, sidewalks, alleys, along rivers and creeks. Anything that is owned by the City and County of Denver is available for someone to live on (Red Rocks, the Highline Canal, some of Denver's mountain parks). Yes they have the right to provide themselves shelter, it does not define specifically the kinds of structures. They have the right to live in a car, anywhere, without time limited parking. This will absolutely override our parks curfews and regulations.

515,EWpx9qru6cHM,Chelsea H.,City Park,9 Sep 19,"DPD is the WORST! Children not protected. Hi all, Here is my fair warning to you - Denver Police is leaving threatening people on the street and then blaming the victims. See below story and watch out for this guy (picture attached). The worst part is this story involves my son's Montessori school. When I got to the school The shirtless tattooed man was standing in the gravel driveway just staring at the school, not sure how long he had been there but his stare did not waver as I walked across the street into the school. Once inside the school, all the kids came out onto the playground and he still did not waver in his stare. I was inside talking to Nancy when another teacher came in and said there is a creepy guy across the street just staring at the yard, kids and school. At this point, I went out and stood on the stoop right by the door with a direct view into the yard across the street. The guy turned around, went into the yard and started looking for full gas containers. He picked one up and smelled it and then dumped a little out and continued searching. This is when I quickly went across the street to put my son in his car seat but all the kids and teachers were outside still. I then saw the man find a full gas container and start walking back toward the street and school, that is when I told Nancy to take the kids inside and call 911. At this moment a dad and his baby were leaving the yard and walking towards their car on the school's side of the street, the guy started shouting things at them and so I caught his eye and signed no. He kept walking towards them threateningly and so I jumped forward with my car a couple of feet to let him know I was not going to let him near them. That is when he put his hands with the gas can up in the air even more threateningly and started coming towards my car. I reversed and then saw the other dad was safely in the car with his baby. The guy then stormed into the gravel driveway, got in his White 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee, reversed out of the gravel drive and drove right at me (the dad in the other car saw the whole thing) he swerved at the last minute and drove away. The police did not respond for hours. Everyone was gone by the time they did. When the police officer assigned to the case finally called me back today to follow up he told me they would not be charging the man with anything and would be passing the case on to mental services. The police officer said that he could not tell me whether or not the man would be taken off the streets and that there were several other calls filing complaints saying he had been harassing them and they were scared. When I asked if I could press charges and what my rights were he said he would not press charges and would not answer what my rights were. I then read him directly from colorado law what constitutes harassment and that I wanted to press harassment charges. He refused. I asked him again to please arrest the man and file charges. He said that he would have to arrest me too as I drove my car at the guy. I said fine - arrest me too, if it gets him off the streets I am all for it. The officer was condescending and rude and I feel even less safe on the streets of Denver. The worst part, my baby (18 months) is not a priority for DPD. If you know any news outlets that would be interested in this story please let me know, I would love to shine a light on the backward law enforcement. They protect the harasser and blame the victim."
