If you thought the crime was getting bad around here lately Park Hill, just wait until a sanctioned homeless encampment arrives in a parking lot near YOU!

3,183906949,Jim Hannifin,South Park Hill,18 Apr,"Regarding PHUMC Safe Outdoor Space. Some people might presume that many of the people who are out on the streets are there because they were criminals, pedophiles, addicts - or at least maybe anti-social, and based on that might oppose a fenced Safe Outdoor Space tent village in our neighborhood. Of course! Mostly they’re pretty regular folks, though, it turns out.

Our nation used to have a different economic and social framework than we have today. One of the social support structures that our forebears had were their Churches. God bless PHUMC for stepping up to re-take that role.  So far, churches have been the only landowners to offer usable land for Safe Outdoor Spaces to move people off the street curbs.

Regarding S.O.S.s: The difference between the improvement of moving from an apartment into your first house does not remotely compare to the improvement of moving from a tent on a city street-curb, into a tent within a fenced-in enclosure of a church parking lot with san-o-lets, trash service, social structure, electricity, and no fear of having your base “swept” away by city cleaning crews any random day. An S.O.S is still minimal, but is a haven of peace to people who need a haven of peace. 

A precedent: The S.O.S. in the church lot on 16th and Pearl was already built before they decided that they were going to invite everyone from what I saw as the wild filthy crazy “un-sanctioned” camp across the street, to move into the new S.O.S. It’s what I think a Jesus would have done, but still I expected disaster. (And I was one of the volunteers!) Yet when I visited it two weeks later, and multiple times since, it is a Haven of Peace. There are one or two bright bold larger than life characters, but there is peace and security, and there is healing and grace. It is managed by a firm and loving staff and appreciated by grateful campers.

I do not think the larger neighborhood will be impacted for the worse by this camp. (Note there are background checks because of the nearby day-care, too.) I hope they will be surprised to find that the lot has been transformed into something more humanely beautiful and somehow more tranquil than a barren asphalt lot. And it is only for six months.

Kids can still play. Children have agile perception. Teach kids to be wary, but not afraid. That’s how I grew up and I feel my life is richer, for it.

These people who will stay in an S.O.S. aren’t the dregs that a “worst-case” mindset imagines; and we need to do something better than what has been done until now for our fellow humans.  I am proud of this church, and of Park Hill, for stepping up, and I hope that we can crow to the rest of the city: This is what Park Hill does, and you can, too.

(And if it turns out it isn’t “all that”, we can adjust things!)"

5,184828873,Darja Pisorn,Mayfair,26 Apr,"Strange squirrel activity. Hey neighbors! Hoping someone can help me figure out what is going on with the squirrels that live in our tree. 
About 2 weeks ago, I was getting home from an errand and as I was standing on the porch, a squirrel fell from either the gutter or the tree onto our porch. It laid there for a second startled, then got up and walked away. 
The next morning there was a dead squirrel in the grass below the tree. A few hours later, I went out and covered it with a shovel so the mailman wouldn't step on it (I was too big of a wimp to pick it up and throw it out), and my boyfriend said he'd take care of it when he got home. About 30 min after that, I went out to walk the dog and the squirrel was gone from under the shovel. 
Either something came and took it (but I don't know what, because it would've had to be an animal small enough to get under the shovel), or maybe it was in a coma and got up and ran away??? 

Today we woke up to another dead squirrel (maybe the same one?) under the tree. This time Alex is home and was able to scoop it up and put it in the trash bin, but I would love to figure out what is going on. 

Any squirrel experts out there have any insight??"

The fire spread to an adjacent car and the shrubbery next to the neighboring multi-family unit. Flames were reportedly 40 ft in the air. 
Neighbors are claiming that they have photos and video of a neighbor stabbing the tent in the last couple weeks and he has had an altercation with the homeless person.
Police arrived and neighbors began giving them info that they refused to act on, offering the video and photo evidence. 
When the fire department arrived, they let the tent burn out until it caused some large bushes next to cars on private property to catch fire. 
They said they weren’t sure if the tent dweller was still inside. A weird justification not to contain a fire that has now spread to private property. Both the car and the bushes. 
The homeless man emerged a couple blocks away and was not there at the time of the fire. 
This arson is deliberate regardless of the justification. 
The reason I bring this up is because allegedly the perpetrator in this situation may be disturbed and potentially violent. 
Single females have been harassed and verbally threatened by this individual. In most cases they have been bullied into not filing a restraining order out of fear of retaliation.  
This neighbor has had several altercations with other tenants in his own building as well as the neighbors are all gathering reports, photos, videos and information of incidents dating back over the last several years.
If anyone has anything to add regarding the fire or this individual, please reach out publicly here or privately via messaging and I will get this information to the city.

I was  literally floored and became sick to my stomach once I heard the news that 
Was just presented to me by a friend.  Honestly  I can’t see how this location would be considered an appropriate location for housing homeless population.

Who is going to keep the area sanitized and clean of debris that we already see all over the city where these tent cities currently exist?  Not to mention our property values will likely diminish as a result of this horrible decision.. I am all for finding an appropriate location to house our homeless population, but as a tax payer it would have been nice to have had a say in the decision, but instead it was pushed through under the radar!  I mean really, smack dab in the middle of our established neighborhood that is literally a block from our public library and grade school?

41,180511781,Mark Kaplan,Mayfair,17 Mar,"Colorado House Bill 21-1160 that would lead to unnecessary euthanasia of adoptable animals. Neighbors – I am posting this message to make you aware of Colorado House Bill 21-1160 that is currently in legislative committee. If the bill is enacted as currently worded it could lead to the closure of no kill shelters in Colorado and the unnecessary euthanasia of many animals that, with love and caring, are adoptable and go on to live happy and enriching lives with their families. Below is the text of a letter from Barbara Weller, the President of the Board of Directors of MaxFund Animal Adoption Center, a no kill shelter in Denver, addressing the impact of the bill. I will also provide my perspective here.

I have been a volunteer for the past three years at MaxFund, whose mission is to care for and find homes for injured and abused animals. Many of the animals taken in by MaxFund are sick or injured and, unsurprisingly, exhibit behavioral issues. MaxFund treats and rehabilitates these animals and brings them back to health. When necessary, it even provides adaptive equipment to them so that they may lead quality lives. When I started volunteering at MaxFund I primarily expected to spend time walking dogs to provide them with exercise and some time out of the shelter. While that has certainly been the case, I have seen a much more important benefit that MaxFund and its amazing staff and volunteers provide to the animals. They devote incredible energy over days, weeks and often months spending time with the animals, showing them love and compassion, and teaching them to trust people and other animals. The animals’ lives are transformed and they are then able to be adopted into loving homes. 

I recently fostered a MaxFund dog for five months. She is an amazing dog but clearly had not been socialized with other animals and exhibited aggressive behavior when she saw them. Her behavior improved tremendously the more time we spent together. She ultimately was adopted by a loving family which hired a trainer to continue to work with her, and she now lives happily with them and their cat (which initially would have been impossible). In another example, one of MaxFund’s volunteers adopted a partially paralyzed dog and has spent more than a year providing physical therapy for him. A huge smile came over her face when she recently told me how her dog is now able to walk and is living a great life with her. I have experienced great joy seeing many dogs come out of their shells and go on to loving homes as a result of the mission and efforts of MaxFund and the people associated with it. More than a few adopters create Instagram accounts for their pets and we are able to continue to follow their lives. It is truly inspirational. However, if House Bill 21-1160 becomes law, MaxFund could be required to euthanize many of these animals.

Not all animal rescues have the same mission as no kill shelters like MaxFund. In Colorado, our leaders and citizens should be encouraging organizations like MaxFund and the people who support them to save helpless animals. Instead, House Bill 21-1160 would have the opposite effect.

If this is an issue that you care about, then please send an email to the bill’s sponsors and committee members expressing your view. Below is a list of their emails, as well as a link to the bill if you would like to read it. I understand that there is a committee hearing on the bill on March 22, although I do not know the time and location. I have also included a link to a petition created by one of MaxFund’s volunteers that you can sign. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Mark Kaplan

Barbara Weller Letter:
Dear MaxFund Volunteers, Staff and Supporters,

There is a Colorado legislative bill known as House Bill 21-1160 that is currently being considered in committee for enactment. This Bill pertains to all animals that enter into a Colorado shelter.

The major portion of the Bill addresses shelters adopting out ""healthy, safe and social"" animals.  This scenario is already being followed by most shelters and is regulated by PACFA.
.  
The disturbing portion of this Bill addresses those marginal, homeless pets that arrive in shelters in less than perfect condition.  These are the animals needing medical intervention, behavior modification or are simply elderly. They are our blind, deaf, paralyzed, feral, diabetic, abused
and broken cats and dogs.  These are the animals that we champion. MaxFund was founded to care for these animals and is the reason why we continue to exist to this very day.  

Passage of House Bill 21-1160 would put less than perfect animals in harm's way.  No standard criteria is found in the Bill which defines ""quality of life."" Instead of allowing shelters to provide refuge and care for these animals, it allows arbitrary decisions to be made based upon someone's subjective interpretation of an animal's quality of life. Those animals deemed lacking life's quality could be sent away or euthanized.   

We at MaxFund know better.  We see these less than perfect animals enter our shelter.  We provide them with whatever services are needed.   We watch them thrive under the care and love from our staff and foster families.  We see them blossom and, most importantly, we see them go to loving forever homes.

MaxFund and No-Kill Colorado need your action to prevent this Bill from being enacted.  Right now it is in legislative committee.  We want to stop it while it is in committee so that it is never even presented for vote.

Representatives from MaxFund and David Smyth from No-Kill Colorado will be attending a hearing of this Bill on March 22, 2021. Please contact Selina [Davison] if you are interested in attending. Between now and then we hope to inundate the Bill's sponsors and committee members with our opposition to it.

(We all take turns doing this.) I became inspired to make a request for donations of Teflon free pots and pans, after seeing all the folks here who were wanting to help out with heaters for their cold neighbors. The shelter I work for has mostly Teflon coated pots and pans. After watching the movie Dark Waters last winter, I can’t help but worry about the toxic chemicals that might be leaching into the food I make there. If you have any pots and pans you aren’t using or would like to get rid and of, (the bigger, the better,) I’d gladly get you an in-kind donation form, for tax deduction purposes. If you’d like to donate, please let me know. I’ve included the link to the Dark Waters trailer below. The movie is about the poisons in Teflon and how they can affect the human body.

We just recently found out that a long-treasured, historical home is being torn-down. Often referred to as a “jewel of the neighborhood,” this house represents the character, uniqueness and charm that Congress Park is known for, and the reason we all have chosen to live here. Many of you who walk these streets probably know the home. You would recognize it by the double-lot it sits on, the huge shady trees, the pergola in the yard that has been there for over 100 years and the gorgeous turn-of the century architecture. Neighbors are horrified and shocked to see the demolition suddenly begin. Surprisingly, this destruction and permanent damage to the neighborhood can happen without any notice. Not knowing the “plan”, we can surmise that this decision was made from a perspective of short-sighted values and self-serving interests. We stand with the neighbors in saying this is wrong, this is tragic and nothing about it seems just for the people who have lived in this community for many years, and want only to preserve what makes this community special.

The Denver City Council will hold a public hearing and vote next week on the final proposal to modernize rules that govern residential uses in the Denver Zoning Code. The proposed text amendment package would give residents more housing options and providers more flexibility to address the needs of vulnerable communities. It also fixes outdated and confusing language, and addresses long-standing equity gaps in the city's zoning code. The final proposal is the result of three years of work and reflects thoughtful compromise from all sides after months of thorough review by the public, the Denver Planning Board and council members.

50,182974733,Deb Miller,Hilltop,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"About the opening question..... I am struggling to clearly say Why I think of homelessness as an important issue. 
Maybe cuz I have always thought people without housing are just as good as anyone, as me or cuz I was homeless for a few months.  I am not sure. I just do. 

I have volunteered, mostly at the Network Coffeehouse when John Hicks was alive, a small program connected to the then Legal Center for People with Disabilities, but they changed their name to Disability Law Colorado.

51,176589826,Sara Henry,Cherry Creek North,11 Feb,"Chris Hinds Betrays Constituents. Hinds voted in favor of Group Living Zoning Amendment. He just released his ""Perfect 10"" newsletter explaining why he decided to ignore the overwhelming (80%) opposition from us pesky citizens who voted for him. His reasoning (which you can read for yourself) boiled down to his belief that all of us who opposed the measure were driven by fear, not logic. Throw in a little racism, ageism, socio economicism, fear of criminals, fear of REALLY nice developers, etc and it was his duty to overrule our will (the pesky people who voted for him).

Thus, being the superior human being that he surely is, he boldly followed nine of his colleagues forcing changes down our throats that we just don't understand we need bringing real life right to the doorsteps of our homes, schools, businesses, etc. Don't worry, pesky citizens, if things get out of hand as a result of the new Amendment, we the City Council, will immediately fix all of the problems we created just like we fix all of the other problems we've created year after year. Just look at how great we're handling the homeless crisis (cough)!! 

Now, as Chris and his colleagues sit back patting themselves on their backs for their bold social justice votes, they leave us to deal with the everyday ramifications of the reality of their plan. Fingers crossed it's not on your street that group homes form, halfway houses pop up, etc. It certainly won't be on the street of the mayor or multiple city council members who exempted their own neighborhoods from the amendment. Representive government is supposed to actually represent its citizens. Hinds and nine others went rogue and he and the others should be removed from office."

It was parked outside of our house on 12/21/20 for ~48 hours with a woman in the passenger seat. She did not leave the vehicle the entire time. I witnessed her smoking a pipe and dumping liquids outside the vehicle. When my husband approached the vehicle to check on her she shoed him away. Eventually, we called the non emergency police line to report a suspicious vehicle. When the police arrived we heard them state the woman had a warrant for her arrest, followed by them handcuffing her, and taking her away in their police vehicle. Shortly after (~30mins), the police returned with the woman and she remained in the vehicle until next morning when we woke and the vehicle was gone.

76,180617856,Mark Kaplan,Mayfair,18 Mar,"Colorado House Bill 21-1160 that would lead to unnecessary euthanasia of adoptable animals. I posted this message yesterday in the General section of NextDoor but it has been suggested to me that I also post it here since some people do not read that section. I apologize for the duplication and there are numerous comments to the initial post that I will not copy here. There are also links in those comments for those who want to view or testify at the hearing on Monday (either remotely or in person).

Neighbors – I am posting this message to make you aware of Colorado House Bill 21-1160 that is currently in legislative committee. If the bill is enacted as currently worded it could lead to the closure of no kill shelters in Colorado and the unnecessary euthanasia of many animals that, with love and caring, are adoptable and go on to live happy and enriching lives with their families. Below is the text of a letter from Barbara Weller, the President of the Board of Directors of MaxFund Animal Adoption Center, a no kill shelter in Denver, addressing the impact of the bill. I will also provide my perspective here.

I have been a volunteer for the past three years at MaxFund, whose mission is to care for and find homes for injured and abused animals. Many of the animals taken in by MaxFund are sick or injured and, unsurprisingly, exhibit behavioral issues. MaxFund treats and rehabilitates these animals and brings them back to health. When necessary, it even provides adaptive equipment to them so that they may lead quality lives. When I started volunteering at MaxFund I primarily expected to spend time walking dogs to provide them with exercise and some time out of the shelter. While that has certainly been the case, I have seen a much more important benefit that MaxFund and its amazing staff and volunteers provide to the animals. They devote incredible energy over days, weeks and often months spending time with the animals, showing them love and compassion, and teaching them to trust people and other animals. The animals’ lives are transformed and they are then able to be adopted into loving homes. 

I recently fostered a MaxFund dog for five months. She is an amazing dog but clearly had not been socialized with other animals and exhibited aggressive behavior when she saw them. Her behavior improved tremendously the more time we spent together. She ultimately was adopted by a loving family which hired a trainer to continue to work with her, and she now lives happily with them and their cat (which initially would have been impossible). In another example, one of MaxFund’s volunteers adopted a partially paralyzed dog and has spent more than a year providing physical therapy for him. A huge smile came over her face when she recently told me how her dog is now able to walk and is living a great life with her. I have experienced great joy seeing many dogs come out of their shells and go on to loving homes as a result of the mission and efforts of MaxFund and the people associated with it. More than a few adopters create Instagram accounts for their pets and we are able to continue to follow their lives. It is truly inspirational. However, if House Bill 21-1160 becomes law, MaxFund could be required to euthanize many of these animals.

Not all animal rescues have the same mission as no kill shelters like MaxFund. In Colorado, our leaders and citizens should be encouraging organizations like MaxFund and the people who support them to save helpless animals. Instead, House Bill 21-1160 would have the opposite effect.

If this is an issue that you care about, then please send an email to the bill’s sponsors and committee members expressing your view. Below is a list of their emails, as well as a link to the bill if you would like to read it. There is a committee hearing on the bill on Monday March 22 at 1:30 pm in Room 0107 at the state Capitol, 200 E. Colfax Ave., Denver. I have also included a link to a petition created by one of MaxFund’s volunteers that you can sign. Thank you.

Barbara Weller Letter:
Dear MaxFund Volunteers, Staff and Supporters,

There is a Colorado legislative bill known as House Bill 21-1160 that is currently being considered in committee for enactment. This Bill pertains to all animals that enter into a Colorado shelter.

The major portion of the Bill addresses shelters adopting out ""healthy, safe and social"" animals.  This scenario is already being followed by most shelters and is regulated by PACFA.
.  
The disturbing portion of this Bill addresses those marginal, homeless pets that arrive in shelters in less than perfect condition.  These are the animals needing medical intervention, behavior modification or are simply elderly. They are our blind, deaf, paralyzed, feral, diabetic, abused
and broken cats and dogs.  These are the animals that we champion. MaxFund was founded to care for these animals and is the reason why we continue to exist to this very day.  

Passage of House Bill 21-1160 would put less than perfect animals in harm's way.  No standard criteria is found in the Bill which defines ""quality of life."" Instead of allowing shelters to provide refuge and care for these animals, it allows arbitrary decisions to be made based upon someone's subjective interpretation of an animal's quality of life. Those animals deemed lacking life's quality could be sent away or euthanized.   

We at MaxFund know better.  We see these less than perfect animals enter our shelter.  We provide them with whatever services are needed.   We watch them thrive under the care and love from our staff and foster families.  We see them blossom and, most importantly, we see them go to loving forever homes.

MaxFund and No-Kill Colorado need your action to prevent this Bill from being enacted.  Right now it is in legislative committee.  We want to stop it while it is in committee so that it is never even presented for vote.

Representatives from MaxFund and David Smyth from No-Kill Colorado will be attending a hearing of this Bill on March 22, 2021. Please contact Selina [Davison] if you are interested in attending. Between now and then we hope to inundate the Bill's sponsors and committee members with our opposition to it. 

I urge everyone to call or write to the sponsors of this Bill and to copy your objections to all its committee members.  Please also send a copy to Davyd Smith of No-Kill Colorado at info@nokillcolorado.org and to Selina at sheltermanager@maxfund.org so that we can track the strength of opposition for the March 22nd committee meeting. If you prefer calling instead, the Capitol phone number is 303 866-2583. Let Selina know that you have left a message of opposition.

Hi all! We just dropped off the coats (for him and Lilith) a tent, sleeping bag, and a few extra cold weather items for him. He was surrounded by bags!!! Our neighbors are truly wonderful. Chris shared that he could really use a very heavy duty backpack (think army style), boots size 11.5, and possibly a wagon to carry his things. He is so touched by all of the help from the community. I know I have passed by so many times and I’m glad I finally stopped to help. A little kindness goes a long way. 

I will be bringing him some Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow, and will hopefully talk some more about longer term needs. He would like to find some consistent housing so if anyone knows of someone renting out a room/basement, that would be a huge step!

Thank you everyone!!! I think we are all set with the items below. I think that must have been record time!! I will be out looking for Chris tomorrow and will update the post with any additional needs.

88,169410487,Timothy Carter,Hale,1 Dec,"Denver Homeless Out Loud. On December 15th and 16th, 2020, Federal District 10 Judge Martinez will be hearing our case against the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for violating constitutional rights by sweeping people without homes and with nowhere to go - even in a global pandemic. This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housing - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, “The CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.” 

On top of this the suit addresses that, “Over the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (“to where?” is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).” The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can’t afford housing during this pandemic. 

Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that “when I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.” Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time. 

Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. There will be a call-in number where the public can listen to the hearing. Stay tuned for this number. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to the hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place.

89,175020187,Jerson Alvarenga,Hilltop,26 Jan,"Burglary. Early this morning a crime was, again, committed at my property with a beak in and theft. Welcome to the Hunger Games of Denver and Hilltop where burglary is allowed (not to mention gun shots) and where it is treated like an expected, common occurance that is treated more like your problem rather than a crime with a criminal perpetrating violence and flauting safety not to mention the law. Your property is not respected as your property anymore and the police department will respond to the event whenever they want, even after you have called them the 5 times for 5 separate criminal events in our neighborhood on and near my property. I reported a break  and burglery on my property where over $20,000 of theft and damage was done at 3:16am this morning. The police showed up at 4:51am, 1 hour and 35 minutes later.  I thought I lived in a safe and desirable and prominent neighborhood in Denver, but it seems like it is worse than the suburbs of Newark, New Jersey, where I lived for 7 years and I never had to report any crime on or near my property. I have been in this neighborhood less than 6 months and I have had 5 official reports and nothing has happened - not one investigation has been completed on any of the incidents and I have never once recieved any progress report on any of them. I guess I will have to stop reporting these crimes and just watch it on my video cameras and let it happen. Don't waste your time on calling for the authorities for help because they won't help you, and I am speaking from my experience. And there is no mechanism for supplying feedback to the police department - just bureauracy that is designed to shield the department from complaints. Good luck, by the way I have to keep turning these thefts and crimes into my insurance company so the insurance prices are going up in the neighborhood as are our crime statistics which is not good for our property values.

On Monday, February 8th at around 11:10 PM my husbands tool box ON THE BACK of his work truck was broken into and all of his tools were stolen out of it. His company work truck is always parked directly in front of our house as it is too large to fit in our driveway. We live on 13th and Eudora. My Husband left for work around 6:30am Tuesday morning and noticed the lid to his toolbox was hitting the back of his Windshield so he pulled over to see why it was opened. The padlock he uses to lock it was gone so a hammer or another tool was used to pry open the lock. Every night when he comes home from work he double checks to make sure his tools are secured. Everything that was inside his toolbox was wiped out which valued around $2000. My husband knew that it had to have been at least two people, due to how quick they broke into the toolbox, how quiet they were and how fast they emptied it. We later learned from our neighbor across the street of the time frame. She seen 2 Caucasian Males, One of the males was balding. They were in a silver older model sedan with UN-tinted windows and were parked outside in front of her house smoking a cigarette which was directly across the street from my husbands work truck. At the time our neighbor didn’t know who they were as they just moved into the neighborhood a month ago. It was only about 5 minutes when she initially heard her dog barking that initially got her attention and upon opening her door to see who the 2 guys were and why they were standing outside at their vehicle, they took off. This is our only information we have so far as I’ve asked several neighbors if they have any surveillance on ring cameras/home surveillance but unfortunately nothing has came up. Please be on the lookout for any suspicious cars in the neighborhood. Always lock your doors even during the day as 8 months prior to this two cars on our block were rummaged through when doors were unlocked as these incidents both took place during the day. As soon as we have more information or if they apprehend any suspects I will give an update. At this time unfortunately the tools that were in my husband‘s work truck were his personal tools so the company he works for will not cover it as it’s his loss. We did make a police report of this incident. I have reported this information to the police.

He lost his job in March because of COVID 19 and lost his housing . 
Thank you

Update: I just spoke to David , he said the only thing he would be grateful for is food and water and if anybody would like to bring him a warm meal occasionally he would love that he said, apparently a neighbor brought him some rice and beans one night and his face lid up talking about it and how delicious that was .  He said he wants to keep his belonging simple because the less he has the less vulnerable he feels , he’s had other homeless steal some shoes of his feet in the night and someone actually stole his sleeping bag while sleeping in it . 
He says he’s adjusted to the cold and feels content with what he has for the time being. He’s grateful he’s been allowed to hang out at congress park , feels pretty safe there , and would rather not bring to much attention to himself so he’s not asked to leave right now .

I'm not going to shy away from the fact that I chose to pay some bills before I bought my drugs and if they don't want to do anything but  blow it all away that's fine but that's a very serious issue that needs to be made aware of and you know the problem will never go away if they are not going to be held accountable for their actions and decisions that they chose to make in the aspect of the homeless community that have had this opportunity for a chance at doing something different than continuing to be a part of the problem as a victim we understand is crap and the only reason we don't have the opportunity for the people to do what they are going around and raging out crying out and being the most important person who was their own individual self oppressed stuck in this situation and NOT you who help continually or anyone else but that individual.  I need you to understand that  only  maybe  half the community or something is being the way of the homeless community never getting the chance they are crying out for and persecuting people who have no role in the decision that person made when they got 7 to 12000 dollars back pay  and then chose to  blow it off with drugs and alcohol and their  whatever other choices. I'm open for you and I to get an interview with each other set and you and I have a lot of questions about time together to make an impact in our understanding of what is going to need to be implemented by us experienced in our own way and we have a very strong and positive attitude towards this standard strategy for the future innovation of all of us getting to the point of being the good and correct stew.
122,169990571,Timothy Carter,Hale,6 Dec,"Update: Feeding The Unhoused. Tonight's dinner at 15th and Pearl went well. The camp has almost doubled in size since the last dinner we served here 3 weeks ago. No doubt a result of the Arkins Sweep from last week. It looks like main camp houses around 50 people if not more. Their are about 26 tents and most of those have 2- 4 people living in them. The surrounding area houses more making the total number hard to count 

We had about 20 volunteers show up to serve food, distribute clothing , feminine products socks and other donations. 

Had enough chicken , mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes , lasagna , and alfredo to feed around 60 people. What didn't get served at the camp ( most was served tonight ) is being taken to there camps to distribute right now! 

Hope to see some new faces next Sunday and hopefully we can turn up enough food to feed 100 next week! We pick a different camp every week since the sweeps are constantly displacing  people. 

Can't serve food ? You can still help! You can go to food banks for donations to our cooks, prepare a dish to drop off, send volunteers cash to help with expenses , or start a blanket/tent drive in your community!"

Just wanted to share that this note was left on my RV. I usually park along Hale, but sometimes park on Bellaire St when street sweep days pop up.

I work at the hospital (for safety and privacy don’t want to share which one) and utilize my RV for sleep between shifts.

I have parked my RV here since 2018. I pick up trash in the area and try to be respectful of people and the neighborhood space. 

I have never encountered a problem before until yesterday. I was out of town for work/holiday and did not see the original note (see below) left around Thanksgiving time. Luckily I returned before my vehicle was towed for being reported as an “abandoned vehicle.”

If you were this person or know who left this note, or in general see my RV around, I just want you to know why I park my RV here and that I hope to stay in the good graces of the neighborhood community. 

And if you see me out wiping away chalk marks off my tires, feel free to say hello!😉"

We can not punish innocent dogs and responsible owners by keeping a ban that is proven to be ineffective! 🐶💕

Vote YES on 2J this November to end Denver’s ban on pit bulls and implement dog laws that focus on responsible dog ownership!

Why?
Breed specific legislation doesn’t make cities safer. Breed isn’t an indicator of whether or not a dog will bite- responsible ownership is. It is proven that pit bulls are not disproportionately dangerous compared to other dogs. Enforcing Denver’s ban on pit bulls has cost the city over $5.8 million. Denver already has rules in place about animal attacks, bites, and dangerous animals. Overall it is discriminatory against responsible owners and their dogs. Thousands of family dogs have been euthanized because of this ban.

If you are interested in learning more, watch Beyond the Myth on amazon prime or reach out for more resources!

New legislation:
1. All pit bulls will be required to be microchipped.

2. All pit bulls will be required to be spayed or neutered. 

3. Only two pit bulls will be allowed per home.

4. Owners will be required to notify animal control if their dog escapes.

5. If after three years there are no issues, the pup will qualify for a standard dog license."

154,169420824,Timothy Carter,Hale,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"Lawsuit Proceedings. On December 15th and 16th, 2020, Federal District 10 Judge Martinez will be hearing our case against the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for violating constitutional rights by sweeping people without homes and with nowhere to go - even in a global pandemic. This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housing - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, “The CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.” 

On top of this the suit addresses that, “Over the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (“to where?” is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).” The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can’t afford housing during this pandemic. 

Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that “when I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.” Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time. 

Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. There will be a call-in number where the public can listen to the hearing. Stay tuned for this number. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to the hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place.

161,184960211,Dana Arvin,South Park Hill,27 Apr,"Petition to Get New Group Living Zoning on November Ballot. The Denver Gazette
Apr 27, 2021

The Denver City Council turned a deaf ear to the public before foisting the bitterly opposed “group-living” zoning scheme — a recipe for neighborhood deterioration — on most of the city in February. The council had its fingers in its ears once again this month, when it extended some of that policy’s profoundly problematic provisions to the rest of Denver.

Had council members been listening, they would have heard deep concern and intense opposition from every quarter. From racially and ethnically diverse homeowners of every social and economic status, representing every point on the compass on the city map.

From supporters for this reckless new policy, however, the council would have heard little more than crickets. And that should come as no surprise given the impact it will have — and how few people would want any part of it.

The council’s February vote sextupled the area of the city where homeless shelters and halfway houses may open, scrapped a buffer between Denver’s schools and halfway houses and permitted up to five unrelated residents/ tenants — and all their family members — in any single-family home. The council’s follow-up action this month extended one of those provisions — allowing five unrelated adults to a house — to the remaining minority of Denver neighborhoods that were still under the old, so-called “Chapter 59” zoning.

All of the city now can look forward to more cars and trash cans lining the curbs of once-quiet residential streets. More overall noise and congestion, as well. What was once a next-door neighbor’s single-family home on a quiet cul de sac could become a de facto apartment complex — without any of the infrastructure to support it.

Meanwhile, in the majority of the city that will bear the full brunt of the zoning changes, it will mean a homeless shelter or even a halfway house could open in a strip mall near your house. It could be next to day cares, schools, rec centers.

Obviously, there’s no core constituency for any of that. This sweeping rewrite of the city’s zoning code wasn’t a call for action by some broad-based citizens group. Nor was it the recommendation of some blue-ribbon panel of presumed experts. It was in fact little more than the daydream of a roomful of urban visionaries in the planning department at City Hall. It was handed off to the council and then imposed upon the public. Fait accompli; done deal.

Of course, the council insists it really was listening all along; that the planning department hosted numerous forums and engaged with Denver residents in other ways; that the policy was revised to accommodate some objections. Then, absent any grassroots support for the basic plan that remained in tact, the council bulldozed ahead anyway.

So, if City Hall was listening to residents, it also was ignoring them. Which is all the more galling.

Hence, a petition drive now underway to place the policy on this November’s ballot in hopes of prompting voters to overturn it. Spearheaded by the upstart citizens group Safe and Sound Denver, the petition drive represents a groundswell of opposition by everyday Denverites who are telling City Hall, “No way. You can’t do this to our families; our neighborhoods; our lifetime investment — our homes.”

Organizers need around 9,000 signatures by May 13; they are aiming for 15,000 signatures to ensure a place on the ballot. They have been hosting gatherings throughout Denver at which residents can sign a petition, and they have been announcing their efforts via an e-newsletter and a helpful and informative website. Visit the website — safeandsounddenver.com — for extensive background on the group-living policy itself and for information on how to get involved in the repeal campaign. One of the site’s pages also offers a lengthy list of neighborhood groups allied with the effort.

As daunting as it can be to fight city hall on any issue, there’s something uplifting and even heartwarming about this earnest, unflinching and spirited movement to roll back a bad policy. It arguably represents Denverites at their best — volunteering their time, talents and energy to band together to push back at a wild overreach by local government.

Here is your chance to stand up for your families, your homes, your neighbors and your neighborhood; for your quality of life. Sign up, and get on board!

164,180840446,Giving Back,,21 Mar,"Today, March 21, is National Single Parent Day, a holiday honoring single moms and dads. This year it's more well-deserved than ever, with many singlehandedly juggling the day-to-day needs of their children with the unique challenges of parenting during a pandemic. 

But even those who do it all sometimes need the support of others. When that's the case, it's neighbors who often step up to help, assisting with basic needs, connecting them to local resources, and offering words of encouragement — a trend that's repeated itself again and again on Nextdoor.

➤ Michelle was living in a Chicago shelter last fall with her young daughter when she first turned to her neighbors, who supplied her with diapers, clothing, and a gift card for food. By March, she had posted an update: ""We begin our next journey and finally found an apartment and out of shelter life. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.""

 ➤ In Nitro, West Virginia, a mother of two was embarrassed to ask for help but was facing financial hardship and in need of basic supplies to get through the week. Neighbors not only provided her with milk, eggs, toilet paper, and bread, but with kind words and resources.

➤ Tara in Littleton, Colorado, put out a request for a ""random act of kindness"" for a homeless single dad and his 13-year-old son, who were sleeping in a heated garage. Within days, the community had secured him a phone, job leads, a vehicle, and temporary housing. ""My faith in humanity has been completely restored,"" she said. ""Our community is incredible!"""

167,154753901,Candace Sake,Mayfair,13 Jul,"Verizon 5G buried in our yard without notice. Hi neighbors!

We returned from our wedding weekend to find an unknown entity has buried a coffin-sized concrete container in our front lawn without our consent.

We’ve received zero communication. No brochures, emails, calls, or even a knock on the door about it—and my emails to the Denver permitting folks have gone unanswered for two weeks now.

We thought it was an eyesore as is, but according to the construction folks that stopped by this morning, it turns out they may add some type of 5G pole as well.

It’s been a bit of a nightmare and we feel violated as homeowners.

Is anyone experiencing something similar in their yard or near them?

170,162282386,Sara Henry,Cherry Creek North,23 Sep,"Email to Chris Hinds re: Group Living Zoning Amendment. Hello Teresa:

As Chris and your office is well aware, the talk of the town and certainly the district that Chris represents is consumed with the proposed changes to the zoning laws that will effect almost all (not the lucky/privileged 20% that will be excluded) of our neighborhoods.  The overwhelming majority of the people with whom I’ve spoken and as evidenced by the vast majority of opinions of the public, object to every aspect of the proposed changes as written as being beyond grossly excessive, prejudicial and dangerous to our communities.  Many of the voters/citizens are absolutely willing to accept and support some of the changes that are reasonable, but the proposal as written is simply obscene.

I was unable to attend the recent Zoom meeting hosted by Chris so I reached out via Nextdoor to ask which council members have publicly stated their positions in regards to the zoning changes.  The response I received is that Chris is in favor of the entirety of the zoning changes as presented.

Will you please tell us in writing where Chris stands on the most important issue that will affect our neighborhoods for years to come?  Is he: 1) in favor of all of the proposed changes in their entirety; 2) in favor of some of the changes, and if so, which portion of the changes does he support/oppose and why; 3) in favor of delaying all of the proposed changes so further community input/evaluations can be made; or 4) in favor of allowing the citizens of Denver to vote on such a life-altering critical issue?

Please provide us with a written response so that I can post Chris’s position on Nextdoor.  The fact that this late in the game we are unsure of where our Denver City Council members presently stand on this issue is grossly unfair to the public that elected them.

I’ve noticed since moving to Denver 3 years ago that many people and neighbors post about “found” cats, friendly cats in their yard, or cats that seem well kept without collars roaming around looking for attention. It truly has piqued my curiosity as this is a very common thing, having outdoor, free roaming pet cats, with or without collars where I’m from. 
I want to state that my own two cats are indoor only, but I never really have too much concern for the neighborhood friendly, well kept pet cats that roam around the houses, and seem to just seek some petting. We have several that stop by our home for attention and move on to the next house. Having one that is in actual distress is another matter of course.

I feel like I need to address a few things: Kathleen Lamb is not an ordinary homeless person. She has a home and a bed, and she has two beautiful girls that she loves. For the last ten years Kat has struggled with mental health issues. She had a severe breakdown this summer, and she has been in and out of psychosis. She was on a 72 hour hold and then was released to the Springs Rescue Mission, without the hospital ever speaking to me or to her case manager or to her therapist or doctor!!!. She did not want to come home. She said she had access to care. She had access to programs and she actually seemed to be thriving. We went down on Sunday to see her and to meet her boyfriend who is working and trying to get them into a better situation. In the last week and a half she began to decompensate. She still seemed okay the last time I spoke to her on duo. She can decompensate within hours, which we believe is what happened. We don’t know if she wandered off and was picked up or if she left with someone but she left her bag, her purse and her phone behind. She never leaves her phone. Not even in her worst condition. She also often carries her purse, even in this condition. The only thing missing is her wallet. And she has not used her cash card that I monitor since Monday. Our mental health system is so broken I have no words. They have made privacy laws so stringent that they put the responsibility of care with the person least capable of even caring for themselves. She does not have a street name. She is NOT your ordinary homeless person. She has friends and she has family who love her more than words can show."

We suspect that the person was on foot since nothing else appears to be taken. Probably wasn’t the easiest to ride away on, so if you see or did see someone walking a blue road bike or awkwardly trying to ride it, please let us know. 

Reported to police. No video or witnesses that we know of. Any information is helpful! 
Thanks,
Caroline

240,171207610,Timothy Carter,Hale,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"General Update & Introductions. Hello to all of our new members and thank you so much for joining us! It's been heart warming to see our group grow to 30 members in less than a month! It's so good to see that our concerns are shared by others in the community , and that their are so many hands willing to work for good!

We have seen over the past month alone over a dozen sweeps of our Unhoused neighbours numbering in the hundreds of people displaced again and again. Moved from block to block, having their belongings discarded, and thier rights violated. The winter is cold enough already , but the city has been colder still. City council refused last month to adjust spending for homelessness mitigation despite several diverse and well thought out community proposals, in favor of increases to funding for sweeps and police overtime. ( The public education budget for next year is slashed btw & the police department is getting an extra 45 million)

Community volunteers have witnessed much over the past few months alone, police brutality, sexual assault by an officer , Hancocks excuses, city councils failure , and the displacement of hundreds more of our neighbours and friends due to the Covid related unemployment crises. 

But we have also made great strides together. We have a network of volunteers securing, storing, and preparing donations of food for sidewalk soup kitchen service, and soon we will have volunteers on the street every day to help feed and warm not just the homeless , but anyone who cares to stop , with a cup of warm soup or a hot coffee, to lessen the burden of their day. ( Interested in getting directly involved with sidewalk service ? Either securing donations , storing and preparing food and other goods, or helping with sidewalk service , please contact Cats Not Cops on Facebook or DM me for more info )

I apologize for a lack of updates on the sweeps that happened this week. For more consistent updates on sweeps and Denver Homeless Out Loud actions you can sign up for the email updates by emailing info@denverhomlessoutloud.org
These emails are unformated, hand typed updates with no nonsense, advertising or repetitive calls for monitary donations. It's just raw , informative updates on the week to week of our action plan and their results. 

This week the sweep of 16th and Pearl was heartbreaking. We have fed this encampment each week for the past month. Over 150 people who could not be admitted to the new church sponsored safe outdoor space  at 15th and Pearl were shuffled off to nowhere, losing possessions and losing more hope each time. 

I will make a post with updates on the action plan for next week as soon as I am privy."
241,158387521,Jean Greenwood,Hilltop,17 Aug,"Oppose Amending Group Living Code. I am opposed to the zoning change to increase density in Denver neighborhoods. Instead of working with developers, city planners and lenders to build more affordable housing, some members of the City council have expressed support for the lazy option of just cramming more people into existing homes. This zoning change has the potential to ruin existing single-family neighborhoods. The amendment would increase the number of unrelated adults who can live together to eight or more. Individual family homes could be turned into boarding houses for week-to week and month-to-month renters. Properties could be turned into group living facilities for the homeless, community corrections (halfway houses) and special care. As the number of residents’ increase, so does the number of cars, noise, overcrowding and safety problems.   
What is behind this zoning change? In a word, money. It has been reported that many of the Group Living Advisory Committee (GLAC) members have ties to for-profit group living businesses and organizations. These for-profit groups are not concerned about Denver neighborhoods. Instead their motivation is increasing the number of people landlords can legally charge rent to. Measures comparable to what GLAC is proposing has been passed in other cities. In those cities, single-family homes were purchased by investors who turned them into dormitory-like dwellings and group living facilities. And what was the result in these cities? Neighborhoods were ruined as renters moved in and homeowners moved out.
Members of the Denver council have a choice to make. Are you going to protect single-family neighborhoods or ruin them? Are you going to stand with Denver homeowners or investors? Do the right thing and vote to not amend the Group Living Code.

(Prior Post) Denver weighs code changes allowing up to 5 unrelated people to live together, expanding halfway house sites
The Denver City Council is considering several code changes to help those in need of affordable housing and different types of residential care, though some feel strongly the issues should wait or be shot down entirely.

The first change would allow up to five unrelated people to live together in the same home, said Andrew Webb, senior city planner. And the second would expand the number of places where residential care facilities — like nursing homes and community corrections facilities — can be located.

Big dude ran up as he pulled in, ripped open the car door and starting punching him in the face and continued as he pulled him out. Took off w/ the car w/ super $$$$ bike and lots of accessories (helmet, wetsuit etc). WTF!!

He is physically OK, a bit shell shocked. He is a very strong guy, but he was unable to overcome the 300 lb guy w/ the element of surprise (and his 2 hands on the outside door handle). Thank God there was no gun pulled!. The whole thing was caught on video and the 7-11 clerk saw the whole thing. Guy came out of nowhere, broad daylight. 

Cops came and report was filed, but unlikely to catch the guy or recover the car (and definitely not the bike). 

I’ve lived in this neighborhood 14 yrs and never heard of this happening, and never felt unsafe (and I am a woman, taking reasonable precautions I would take anywhere).

263,160572160,Sara Henry,Cherry Creek North,6 Sep,"Denver Group Living Change.org Petition. I received an email tonight setting forth details of various city council members' concerns about the rapid push to implement changes to the zoning code allowing up to 10 unrelated individuals and  an unlimited number of their relatives to live in the same home. I was heartened to see numerous council members push back and ask numerous pointed questions of the planning department.  Their concerns included: not enough time/input from the community especially during Covid, not enough analysis on whether this would actually hurt neighborhoods of color/low income, outside commercial interests pushing this to make more money, acknowledgment that literally there would be no cap on the number of people in one residence, 90% of public input thus far opposes the zoning change, exemptions will granted to about 25% of Denver areas forcing other areas to absorb more of the impact, etc. Bravo to the council members asking these critical questions before this kind of massive change is shoved down almost all of our throats without giving the voters/citizens of Denver the right to vote on such a life-impacting issue!!

The notifications I'm receiving with these updates from Change.org keeps asking for donations to further the fight against this zoning change. Does anyone know where the money goes that's donated? I never donate to a cause unless I know who's getting that money and how it'll be spent. If anyone can answer this question I'd appreciate hearing from you."

268,158127610,Nancy Bell,Hilltop,14 Aug,"I wanted to share this letter. Councilman Kashmann: 

For forty-seven years I have made my home in Denver after returning from service in Vietnam. I was attracted to living in Denver because it had a renowned reputation for excellent neighborhood communities and spirit.  I chose Congress Park as the neighborhood in which to live and raise my family, opting to send all three of our children to Denver Public Schools. I volunteered for years on the soccer fields, in the schools, in neighborhood organizations  and in my downtown place of worship.  While we as a family, and I as a practicing lawyer for over forty-four years, assisted those who struggled in our community to meet basic human needs, we felt safe and took pride in neighborhood activities.  I moved to University Park fifteen years ago, when I needed to find a wheelchair accessible home for my daughter (a housing need not addressed or met by Denver's leadership) ; I have continued neighborhood participation and have run for office twice for the University Park area.  

I am therefore appalled and outraged by Denver City Council's apparent effort to disregard the efforts of homeowners and citizens to improve their neighborhoods and develop neighborhood spirit and cohesiveness - open to persons of all racial, ethnic, sexual preferences and social backgrounds, etc  - by undermining the desire of all homeowners to live and raise families in safe, open and livable space, by destroying reasonable density and property use zoning with Group Living mandates.  I was raised in the city of Philadelphia, have lived in a number of high density cities on the East and West Coast, and chose to move to Denver to put those less than desirable experiences behind me.  There is no reason or justification to implant Group Homes with more than three unrelated persons - and their relatives - or Community Corrections half way housing or drug rehab facilities in neighborhoods where young children, play, ride their bikes and walk to school.  As a defense attorney, I have first hand knowledge of the unsafe conditions that attend half way houses and drug rehab centers. No Denver resident should be unaware of the issues posed by current un-monitored ""camp sites"" in family centered neighborhoods, with attendant drug use, crime and health issues.  At the same time, certain City Council politicians seek to defund the police and offer us the chaos and vandalism of downtown Denver; shame on them !   

The Group Home approach reflects a lazy, non creative, and foolish approach to issues that demand intellect and commonsense - spread the problem and pander to certain ideologues and constituents, while doing nothing to address the mental illness, drug abuse, and hopelessness of those on the streets, or cramming more people into homes and neighborhoods where the infrastructure is lacking and the likelihood of those people becoming part of the community is next to nil.  Denver is large enough to implement creative housing options and ""campsites"" that offer basic services and security, without trashing existing neighborhoods. Do citizens really want the unsafe and unhealthy circumstances of Civic Center Park and the downtown Denver Library to be superimposed on our safe neighborhoods? A resounding NO is the answer. 

Councilman Kashmann - represent your constituents and stop cowering to the radicals on City Council that are spearheading this destructive effort, that will lead to families leaving the City for safer neighborhoods. I will look for your leadership in the days ahead.

I am starting this thread for a woman named Jan that responded to NEXTDOOR a couple of weeks ago expressing need for help but little detail. After pursuing that sub-posting and meeting her, I feel she merits some short term help. Although I encouraged her to write her own thread, she felt the potential of extensive response would be overwhelming. I have her consent to inform you about her needs. In short, she is middle aged and single with no family, disabled with a service dog, recovering from surgery, resumed work after 5 months unemployed due to pandemic, resourceful and humble. Her disability involves degenerative disk disease so lifting of weight is difficult.

Her immediate needs are basic including replenishment of food supply, sundries, auto gas, utilities, and a few new clothing items due to long unemployment which precipitated substantial weight loss. Most of this she would prefer to obtain at Walmart due to modest prices. Walmart gift cards or cash would see these needs.

In addition to her paid work, she sells some items on line such as clothing, purses, unopened facial creams, small household and garage items with limited weight. She is open to these donations. Unsold items are subsequently donated.

Her other needs include a referral for a Therapist that takes MEDICAID as she is sometimes able to pay the difference in rates. She would need talk therapy for depression. Her face also lit up with the mention of the last item which would be a message with a professional able to accommodate her spinal condition. This might need to wait for the pandemic to subside around summertime as she is being quite careful.

Any help as described, that you may provide would be greatly appreciated. You may also text message me at 612 666 5972 as that would be easier than following the thread on this site.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/h92ob3/loststolen_dog_in_cap_hill_an_updateplea/

Please read below:

TLDR: my dog was claimed by a person experiencing homelessness roughly 400 ft from my house hours after getting loose in Cap Hill. Need as many eyeballs as I can get to locate him.

If you read my previous posts, my dog was “claimed” by a person who sometimes stays in the encampment on 13th and Wash roughly two hours after he got loose from my house on 13th and Ogden.

Over the last seven days, I have been to every shelter, several tent cities, resource centers, food banks and most churches that do hot food distribution to try and locate this guy. I have every homeless outreach team in the city and the Salvation Army “walkers” notified and on the look out and have flyered to bouncers and security guards who patrol businesses in the area.

As of Friday morning, it was confirmed the man was seen with Huck, tearing down my flyers outside of the liquor store on Logan and Colfax. I’m working w an angel of an employee at Good Chem to try and get security footage so I could at least have a facial ID.

If you live in the area and can help me look, that’s all I need...EYES. He goes up and down colfax, stays at the Y, Civic Center, and occasionally designated apartments and halfway houses near the Washington and 13th area. He’s a loner though, so most people I speak to can ID the dog but not him or his whereabouts.

It’s also possible he has migrated to the Cherry Creek Trail or Platte River Valley Trail in advance of the impending city camp clean up so if you bike those, please be on the lookout.

The guy is about 6 ft tall, has reddish blonde hair, is a middle aged ex vet who drinks and goes by John. He is calling my dog Babe and using a leather belt as a leash. People in the community who know this gentleman have suggested you do not approach. If you sight, please just contact me on here. I can be there ASAP with resources but even past sightings help so I can better narrow down his routines.

My dog is a Black and Tan Aussie Shepherd/Aussie Kelpie mix w a black speckled tongue, brown eyes, erect ears, and a natural bob tail that is only four inches long. If you walk your dog on colfax or surrounding parks, please pay attention! He’s very social and would be likely to say “hi” to your puppy. There are pics in my previous posts.

I’m devastated and desperate and have seen a lot of scary shit over the past couple of days...it hurts my heart that any living creature is experiencing these conditions, but selfishly I hate that my dog is currently living in and out of tent cities too and being around a lot of instability, hard drug use and violence.

When I was flyering on Friday, I met a guy doing outreach who after a few minutes of conversation, determined that we think he owns Huck’s littermate. We got them from the same shelter at the same time from a big litter that came in and they look like twins. I feel trolled that I can find Huck’s literal brother in a five minute happenstance meeting but can’t locate the guy within a mile radius of my house who has him 😞. I promise Reddit cute play date videos of the two puppies reuniting if you help me find my dog.

288,154469263,Phillip Astein,South Park Hill,10 Jul,"A Sad Day In Denver. Dear Neighbors,

Yesterday was a sad day in our beautiful city. An event occurred that I found to be quite egregious. 

At approximately 7PM I was at a red light at the intersection of Quebec and 35th. Coming across our path was a GMC Jimmy being pushed backwards into the intersection by a middle aged man. A Woman was in the drivers seat steering. It seemed they were hoping to get the broken down car into the neighborhood over by Brakes Plus. 

I live on Quebec street so it‘s not uncommon to see a fellow commuter dealing with a bad day and a broken car. Usually a Park Hill neighbor will come out and ask if everything is ok. This was different, this man was really struggling to push this car and as the car gained some momentum into the intersection he couldn’t keep up and promptly tripped and rolled on his back revealing a prosthetic leg. At this point the car was slowing in the middle of the intersection and the man was struggling to get up. Of course, our light had turned green. I jumped out of my car and ran to help push the car to the other side. The man stumbled over and said “thank you sir”. I looked back and all I saw was a bunch of mouth breathers in their cars at the intersection staring at me. 

W....T....F Denver? What happened? How am I the only one that helped these people. We’re a community! We can do better. Denver showed up in droves for the protests, put the BLM signs in the front yards but people can’t get out of your air conditioned car to help a fellow human!?  Sad. 

If you are reading this you most likely weren’t at that intersection but my intention is to remind us all that moments like that, when you are the one in need and vulnerable, are the moments that make a city feel like a very lonely place. Keep an eye out for moments were you can change that please. Our city needs this.

He rode off on a silver and purple mountain bike. Our internet was down till just a couple hours ago, so I was unable to post this anywhere till now. Keep an eye out.

297,151220460,"Steve Staeger, 9NEWS",,10 Jun,"Neighborhood Trades. Hi everyone! It's been a little while. Our newsroom has been overwhelmed covering COVID and the protests of George Floyd's death. All of it has been a bit overwhelming, but I wanted to share a happy neighborhood moment from this week and see if you've ever experienced anything like it in your neighborhood.

As I've mentioned far too many times here, I love to homebrew beer. It's a hobby that I've really ramped up to get me through this time at home.  This week I had a bucket of spent grain from a New England IPA I brewed.  I posted on my local Nextdoor to see if anyone needed compost. Mel messaged me that she'd love to use the spent grain and hops to feed her backyard chickens. In exchange - she gave me some eggs (and I threw in a homebrewed wheat ale). I scrambled a few eggs yesterday - they're delicious and you can tell the difference from store bought! She texted me later that the chickens LOVED the grains.  This is the beginning of another great partnership.

What kind of neighborhood trades do you do? I'm in the mood to be inspired. I'm also considering launching a ""Good Neighbors"" segment on 9News weekends.

Stay safe and stay healthy! - Steve"

301,169539467,Timothy Carter,Hale,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"Arkins Sweep Update. For the past couple months police have been telling people who they sweep from other more visible downtown sites to go to Arkins. Now the City has  come in to sweep them. To where???

Why not provide dumpsters with regular trash pick up? Why not provide port-a-potties (at least 1 for every 10 people)? And if not that...why not provide housing that residents of this camp can afford according to their info? 

No, instead our City thinks sweeping 300 people to scatter to downtown blocks, down the river, or who knows where else is the answer.

Yesterday was the second day of sweeps at the Arkins encampment. The previous night residents of the camp were told they could not get back into their property - some slept right outside the fence with what they had. Others scattered to who knows where without their property. Others were told they could go in, but if they came back out they could not get back in to get the rest of their property. In the morning, starting around 6am, the City started trashing property - indiscriminately scooping property with bulldozers and bobcats and crains. Anyone who had their property there but was not allowed in lost all their property. One of the only people who got their property yesterday was a woman we helped get back in to get her stuff just before they were about to trash it. 

After the sweep yesterday, police went to numerous other camps around town - many where residents from Arkins moved to - telling them they could not be there under camping ban enforcement. People trying to move from the Arkins sweep were stopped from setting up at various camps - including cops threatening volunteers helping folks move with “illegal dumping” if they unloaded the person’s property.

Effective for 30 days starting Sunday, November 8, all people in Denver should be home by 10 p.m., with certain exceptions, including going to and from work, interstate travel, and getting medical care. During this time, all public and private gatherings of people who are not members of a single household are prohibited, except for limited purposes. 

This is not intended to be a traditional curfew, but rather a restriction on gatherings, business hours, and a guidepost for behavior that will help Denver get through the next 30 days. Any business not defined as critical must close to the public during Home by 10 hours. Critical businesses include, but are not limited to, hospitals, grocery stores, and pharmacies. 

No alcohol sales or consumption after 10 p.m. will be permitted at any facility that sells alcohol, including restaurants and grocery and liquor stores. Restaurants will still be able to offer food takeout and delivery after 10 p.m. Under the new order, groups at restaurants will now be limited to six people from no more than two households, down from 10 people, for the duration of the Home by 10 public health order.

Recreational athletic activities, including organized youth and adult league sports, practices, games, and tournaments, are prohibited. Spectators are prohibited at all post-secondary and Colorado High School Activities Association (CHSAA) sanctioned sporting events.  

The city is taking this action to help stem the increase in cases and hospitalizations and avoid another stay-at-home order being imposed on Denver by the State.

Hello my fellow Denver neighbors. I am posting as a final effort to reach out before my family faces homelessness on June 1st. If you or someone you know has a 3 bedroom house/condo/duplex for rent, or any resources for a family in need of permanent shelter, that I have monthly income to pay for, please, please contact me through Nextdoor or email munepenny@gmail.com.

I am a single mom of two boys and we have two trained and friendly adult female Great Danes, one is eldery. We have been living in rental homes for years, but due to the pandemic, we are struggling to find a home that fits us all within my $2K-$2,500/mo budget for rent. Our lease is up in our current home near Lindsley Park, and we have had several applications I've put in this month denied. Some of you may recognize me from Nextdoor as your neighbor, or your Nanny, or your trusted dogsitter and housesitter. I have been active in our community in all these roles, and have strong neighborhood references to back me up.

I have congestive heart failure from the open heart surgery I received in 2015 to replace the aortic valve in my heart and save my life. I am disabled, however, thanks to the support of my boys Evan-15 and Noah-11, I lead a modified yet active and fulfilling life with them and our girls (the Danes). My oldest son is a bike mechanic that has been active in our community as well, having fixed up donated bikes to resell, or provide tune ups and repairs to our neighborhood. My youngest son is an avid and talented artist and performs the brunt of our household chores, from dishes to picking up poop on a daily basis, he keeps our household neat and tidy. I am in digital marketing sales and work remotely from home as a self contracted employee for 6 months until I am hired on permanently. The three of us function like a well oiled machine, we are a tight and unified family unit.

Here's why we have been denied applications for rental homes this month. My credit is shot due to recent divorce, from an abusive and alcoholic ex husband who wouldn't work, my boys' father. We left him and his dysfunctional family in Dallas and moved to Denver, where I grew up, to start a fresh life for ourselves. Also, even though we have strong rental, personal and pet references, landlords are concerned that we are not a two adult income household and/or they do not allow large dogs. I have also been denied because of my health issues and recent job changes, due to the pandemic, these past few months. Even though I don't look as good on paper as other applicants, I was hoping to find a decent human who would extend some faith and trust in my little family, I have income, and I have first month's rent and security deposit ready to go, if someone would just give us a chance. Thanks for reading, and I hope someone can provide some information or assistance to us before it is too late."

335,157268079,Nancy Bell,Hilltop,6 Aug,"Community Corrections-Group Living. From Florence Sebern:
Jane Prancan, 17-year member of the Denver Community Corrections Board, answered some questions and commented about the Group Living Zoning Code Amendment and it's connection to Denver Community Corrections.

Q&A with Jane Prancan, August 3, 2020

Q: Can the business model for Denver community corrections accept candidates from other jurisdictions?  
A: Yes, candidates can be accepted from any jurisdiction in Colorado – referrals from both the Department of Corrections and Judicial Department (probation).

Q: Do persons eligible for community corrections within Denver limits need to be Denverites?  
A: No, they can be from any jurisdiction in the state.

Q: Can the community corrections business model that steps into the GEO/CoreCivic void, grow beyond what is needed to serve our Denver system?  
A: There is no limit to the number of clients in any facility except zoning and the ability to receive reimbursement from the State for each client.

Council members are leading the effort to create community corrections in small houses in neighborhoods with little to no supervision. They claim that all community corrections clients are simply low level drug offenders.  I might note that no City Council member has ever attended a community corrections meeting.

Low level drug offenders present certain challenges, but community corrections does not place only low level drug offenders.

Thus far, at the four Community Corrections meetings in July 2020, following is the breakdown of sentencing crimes for offenders reviewed. Crimes vary from month to month. This list is typical of the cases reviewed.  It is also important to note that every one of the offenders referred has a lengthy criminal background including misdemeanors and felonies.
• Assault-usually 2nd degree – 21
• Dangerous drugs-manufacture/sale – 10
• Menacing – 8
• Homicide – 4
• Aggravated robbery (usually with a weapon) – 15
• Aggravated motor vehicle theft (carjacking) – 5
• Vehicular assault – 2
• Child abuse – 1
• Sex offense – 5
• Kidnapping – 2
• Weapons – 5
• Others including identity theft, extortion, fraud, dangerous drugs, stalking, organized crime (usually gang related) forgery and trespass (often domestic violence) – 17

The numbers, above, are for individual offenders and the crime of conviction that resulted in each one being sentenced to the Department of Corrections. Many persons have multiple offenses, for example: a person convicted of armed robbery will also have additional charges for unlawful possession of weapons; kidnapping is often accompanied by assault charges.

I have long been a supporter of Community Corrections and worked with communities to assure safety for the neighborhoods.  Now encouraging violent offenders with little to no supervision and few services is troubling.  This new effort is of great concern to me.""

The Denver Community Corrections Board oversees the acceptance and rejection criteria for all offenders considered for placement in the Denver Community Corrections Residential program.

Board responsibilities include reviewing all matters relating to Community Corrections and when appropriate, advising the city on actions to be taken.

The Board acts on behalf of the citizens of Denver to ensure the protection of the community and to safeguard the rights of residents, provide for the needs of offenders who will be supervised by Community Corrections, act as a liaison for Denver with other city and state agencies and establish policies and procedures that govern the administration of the program and criteria for acceptance into the program.

337,147775576,Brittany H.,City Park,11 May 20,"WARNING: Car break in. On Friday night just before midnight, I was dozing off on the couch until I heard loud banging and screaming outside. My first instinct was someone being shot and screaming in pain, it was terrifying. But nope, I look out my window to see a man breaking into my car. 

Be careful out there guys. He busted my window in, and I yelled at him to get away from my car through my apartment window and he took off running and luckily with no items.

The strange part? I had absolutely nothing valuable in my car, nor did I have anything in my car out in plain sight besides my fold up massage table (I'm an esthetician) The motive was strange; as he made a lot of noise and drew attention to himself.

This is just a warning, it happened to another neighbor in the same building. Make sure you don't leave valuables inside your car- break ins are happening left and right. I spent my entire Saturday getting the window fixed. I have reported this information to the police.

Thanks to everyone who replied to my first post. I’m trying to keep up with the volume.

We heard from a few of you asking where I lived, and how I was posting to multiple Nextdoors. I’m a Denver metro area resident like you, and this is part of a partnership between Nextdoor and 9NEWS. Nextdoor is trying to make sure that trusted local journalists, in your area, are covering stories that are important to you, and they’re helping make that happen by helping us talk to everyone in the Denver area. 

Neither I nor 9NEWS has access to your neighborhood posts. The only interaction I have with you is through your comments on my posts or your private messages to me.  

This is why my first post wanted to know both what you’re doing…and how you’re doing...during our sudden “social distancing”.

The hope is that we can become better listeners to the neighborhoods in our area.  So what stories are important to you? What do you want to see your local reporters talking about today? You can let me know in a reply.

Thanks,
Tom"

343,158578570,Betsy Rumely,Congress Park,19 Aug,"Halfway houses in neighborhoods—not equity, despite Webb’s claim. What I strongly suspect has happened is that the land zoned for halfway houses was taken over by developers in areas, such as LoHi.  So now rather than plan for the displacement of halfway houses and save some land for the halfway houses in land zoned for that, the developers took all sites away. So the City’s great solution? Rezone residential areas and fill neighborhoods with people on probation, create safety risks, and degrade home values.  People in halfway houses are on probation; they have not, as Webb claims, paid their debt to society.  Rather they have been released early, so that they can attempt to prove that they can function safely in society.   They have not proved that they deserve to live wherever they want, despite Andrew Webb’s claim that this is equity.  And notice how the recidivism rate is never discussed.  As with most things currently underway in our city with this administration, follow the money.  The money was in pushing halfway houses out of LOHI to allow large scale redevelopment.  I have a close family member who has been in halfway houses—in LOHI; these places no longer exist, and believe me, you don’t want those folks as neighbors. Not yet."

Blvd. OK, I know not everyone's concerned about this whole COVID-19 thing, but for those who are at least trying to observe the very basic suggestions on social distancing, I'd like to give you a heads-up on one of our local businesses. I'm 76 so I pretty much need to observe.  I just dropped off a UPS return at the store on 700 Colo. Blvd.  I saw that an extreme minimum of the distancing guidelines are being observed there. The lobby is very small so there's an absolute minimum of space for 6' distancing, clerks are not wearing masks and there are no other forms of barriers, and, a steady stream of observing and non-observing customers are coming in one after the other.  This caught my attention because I've been to many other local businesses that are doing a good job of keeping their customers safe and it's much appreciated.  In those stores, you can at least assume that they try to clean and disinfect regularly.  However, in this UPS store, I got no such feeling and they deal with a lot of customers each day.  My recommendation is that if you need to ship, that you shop around for other UPS stores locally that observe a higher level of citizenship toward their customers"

For the last two years, Denver city planners have been working with residents, policy experts, advocates and service providers, neighborhood groups and other community members to update the Denver Zoning Code’s regulations on residential uses.

The project's goal is to update zoning rules in support of the city’s strategy for more and better housing opportunities for all residents, to remove barriers for those who need supportive services and to provide greater clarity for providers and neighbors.

Starting next week, we'll host four open houses that will give residents an overview of the changes and an opportunity to share their thoughts.

From Gail Skyes, with permission. To
City Council members, Mayor Hancock and Andrew Webb,

I listened to Wednesday’s presentation by Andrew Webb regarding the recommended changes to Denver’s Group Living Zoning, and I want to express my strong concerns and opposition to what is happening.   

The Committee has lumped together so many major changes in to this proposal that citizens cannot intelligently consider what the overall impact will be to our city. 

The Committee says new zoning regulations will “simplify” the Zoning code for the city. This is blatantly untrue.  It will, in fact, create a quagmire for citizens and make it impossible for us to address our neighborhood’s needs. 

The proposed zoning changes push enforcement and monitoring of zoning regulations on to the citizens while absolving the city zoning agencies of any responsibility for the effects of the changes.  Citizens have been told we can call 311 or the police for help on violations. 

What involved citizens are hearing and being sensitive to is what affects them - not the holistic body of changes being proposed and what this re-zoning proposal ultimately means for our communities.   

Some people are concerned that the current definition of unrelated adults and their families is discriminatory to the LGBTQ community and that it does not recognize current societal norms or desire for communal living. 
They support the zoning proposal.

Older people are threatened by all of the changes at once, particularly with all of the neighborhood issues we are already facing each and every day, without government support.
They do not support the zoning proposal.

Homeowners and neighborhood communities are rightfully concerned about overcrowding, residential care facilities, homeless shelters, and prison facilities in the neighborhoods without clear and defined rules regarding density, proximity to schools and community gathering places , 
They do not support the recommended changes. 

Many people support pieces of the bill, but we cannot currently consider or support them separately.  I believe this is exactly what the special interests driving this initiative want - chaos, ignorance and apathy that will ensure approval of their initiative without allowing citizens to address each piece intelligently. This feels very much like what is happening to citizens on a national level, and is flat out wrong. 

The “data”, as we are consistently hearing from the Committee, is that it's good (!) for our neighborhoods  to encourage:  Severe overcrowding of single family residences without bathroom or minimum square footage requirements; unregulated and unlicensed halfway houses, residential care, nursing, rehab and correctional facilities without regard for children and home owners’ well being; and expanded congregate living (rent by the room).  

Let me simplify - the Committee is paving the way for:  overcrowding of neighborhoods and public services for the enrichment of landlords and real estate speculators, profiting by private investors for the unregulated care of our most vulnerable citizens needing nursing and rehabilitation services, price gouging and profiting by investors of private prison expansion (that WE tax payers will also be paying for) and, of course,  Air B&B. 

And for all of this “progress” under the guise of “affordable housing and helping the homeless”,  we tax payers and citizens who have built these desirable neighborhoods to live in get to monitor and deal with the inevitable abuses and problems that will result. 

A selling point for the Committee is that  Seattle, Portland, Washington DC and other cities have this progressive model in place and it’s the way to go for Denver.  This conclusion is based on naivety and / or stupidity. Denver is not those cities nor do we want to be. 

In response to safety concerns voiced by citizens, Mr. Webb stated that city code requires sprinklers and other safety installations.  Therefore, we can be assured that domiciles under the new zoning proposal will conform to safety and fire codes.  

These building codes apply to new build, not to existing structures.  Old domiciles will not need to update and conform, just as current homeowners are “grandfathered” in on other unsafe situations such as illegal apartments that don’t meet current zoning requirements.    

Most of the rentals in my neighborhood have out of state owners who contribute directly to speculative housing price increases, do not care for the properties they own, and do not contribute one thing to our neighborhoods or the fabric of our community.  Why are we continuing to encourage more of this type of investment at the expense of our citizens?

WE are the economic base for Denver city initiatives.  WE are the fabric that holds community together and makes Denver a city that people of all ages want to live in.  WE are Denver residents. 
Ignoring our concerns and lumping everything the Committee has proposed under one umbrella is unconscionable.

Council representatives and mayor Hancock, I ask that you do the right thing for Denver and it’s citizens, and reject the Committee’s rezoning proposal. 

Respectfully,

Gail Sykes

Ms. Picard was the facilitator of in-person and ZOOM meetings and produced all of the meeting summaries. She provided protocols for meetings and process, including how decisions were made; communications and public involvement in the process; approach to drafting the zoning updates.
The first sentences in the first paragraph of the original contract's Exhibit A confirms the real priorities of the proposal:
""A 2008 moratorium on new Community Corrections Facilities will expire in May of 2018. A public discussion of the current regulations is needed to identify any changes before the Community Corrections Facilities moratorium expires. Concurrently, other City and nonprofit organization efforts to address homelessness have highlighted other possible shortcomings in related sections of the Denver Zoning Code pertaining to shelter and group living uses.""
CPD community presentations emphasized the household definition and number of unrelated/per household. The larger priorities of this proposal -- allowing community corrections and homeless shelters in every single-family neighborhood -- were obscured.

Currently, the city allows two unrelated adults, plus an unlimited of related minor-aged children, to live in residential homes. The group home code, Webb said, is very out of date, and the city has determined that the two-adult rule is much more conservative than peer cities, which average a five-adult maximum allowed.

With the year end approaching, I want to make everyone aware of Energy Outreach Colorado, where I am a member of the board.  EOC is a nonprofit organization with the mission of making sure that all Coloradans can afford their energy needs.  We work extensively with the State of Colorado and all major utilities around the state.

In this pandemic year, more Coloradans are struggling financially and help with their energy costs can make a big difference in their lives and, in many cases, keep a family from homelessness.  If you are struggling with your energy bills this winter, please visit the EOC website (www.energyoutreach.org) to see if you might qualify for assistance. 

If you are fortunate enough to be in a position to help your neighbors with their energy costs, I would ask you to consider EOC in your year-end giving.  Colorado Gives Day is coming on December 8th, and that’s a great way to donate, or you can donate directly on the EOC website.  We’re also listed on Amazon Smile, and if you can select us there, Amazon will make a small donation with each of your purchases.

Winter is coming fast and the pandemic is already here.  It’s a scary thing to be on the edge of energy poverty and have to make decisions about whether to pay for food, medicine, or electricity.  If you can help, please do.

Thank you."

You do not need insurance and the vaccine is free. Still, vaccine access can be confusing, and sometimes things get in the way of getting the healthcare you need. If you are facing any of the following barriers to vaccine access, we have services and resources to help. 

... I can’t get an appointment.

Vaccine supply doesn’t currently meet the demand in our community, and appointments can be hard to come by. Still, all residents are strongly encouraged to get a vaccine as soon as they can, wherever they can. 

In Denver, the state is currently operating Ball Arena as a mass vaccination site. Schedule an appointment by visiting truecare24.com/co. The City and County of Denver also supports four community vaccination sites to ensure residents in vulnerable communities have easy access to the vaccine. Residents ages 18 and over can call 720-865-3005 for information about dates, times, and registration requirements. 

There are also many resources available online and by phone to help you find an appointment or get on a waitlist for providers in your area. Sites like www.vaccinefinder.org and www.vaccinespotter.org/CO/ are up-to-date tools that help you track down COVID-19 vaccine appointment openings, and providers like Kroger, Safeway, CVS, and Walgreens all have appointment systems of their own.  

Find more information about vaccine options in Denver at www.denvergov.org/Government/COVID-19-Information/Vaccination 

... I can’t leave my home for medical reasons.

The Denver Department of Public Health and Environment offers at-home vaccination for people who can't leave their homes. For more information on how to get this service, visit our website or call the DDPHE at 720-865-3005 and press option 4. 

... I don’t have a ride.

If you lack access to transportation, call Mile High United Way’s 2-1-1 help center. Mile High United Way and Lyft have partnered to help Denver residents get to their non-emergency vaccine appointments.  

If you have a disability that keeps you from using regular mass transit services, find out more about RTD’s Access-A-Ride program by visiting www.rtd-denver.com/services/access-a-ride.  

... I need childcare.

Mile High United Way connects residents to childcare for those who need it. Call 2-1-1 for more information. 

... I have a health condition and I’m afraid the vaccine could make me sick.

According to the CDC, most people with underlying health issues can safely take the vaccine. If you are worried, talk to your doctor. 

... I am undocumented.

You do not have to be a documented citizen to get a vaccine. Providers may ask for ID or insurance information at your vaccine appointment. These documents ARE NOT required to get your shot. You will not be turned away for not having these documents. 

... I have a language barrier.

The City of Denver’s community vaccine sites provide language support for a variety of languages, as do many other vaccine providers in the community.  

... I am afraid of needles.

Understandable! Healthcare providers are trained to make the vaccine shot as painless as possible. Don’t let your fears keep you from getting this lifesaving vaccine! 

... I have concerns about effectiveness.

The COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in preventing infection. All vaccines available in the U.S. are nearly 100% effective in preventing serious illness and death related to the virus.

Getting everyone vaccinated is the most important thing right now. Our community vaccine sites have been set up to serve the ZIP codes in Denver hardest hit by the pandemic, and the city and the state are working hard to ensure that the vaccine is reaching vulnerable and marginalized people, including people experiencing homelessness and who are incarcerated."

In creating four (4) additional extra trash collection routes for a total of eight (8), we move to an eight (8) week extra trash collection schedule and increase our capacity to collect the extra trash our customers are setting out and meet their expectations.  

Here are additional resources we hope are helpful: 
• Residents can go to www.denvergov.org/trash to access their waste collection schedules, sign up for alerts and reminders, and download our app to keep track of their upcoming extra trash collection days.
• Customers that can’t wait until their next extra trash collection service day can find on the city’s website, listings of licensed waste haulers and private drop-off facilities for excess trash, where fees apply. https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/trash-and-recycling/trash-collection/ETC.html"

This week, Mayor Hancock directed the formation of a task force to coordinate efforts to protect and prepare our city, and all of you, for potential cases of COVID-19. 

This work is led by the Department of Public Health & Environment and the Office of Emergency Management. These agencies are coordinating planning and resources with local schools, shelters, public facilities, medical providers, Denver International Airport and other partners. The Mayor has also directed the Department of General Services to begin the installation of sanitation stations in public city facilities and recreation centers. 

 We can all play a role in preventing the contraction and spread of this virus. 

·         Wash your hands often, vigorously, for 20-seconds with soap and water. 

·         Cover your nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing 

·         If you have symptoms of flu, a cold or fever, stay home.

Jim Paris, at one time, had several stores but after he passed away most closed, but the family sold this one to Jeff Stone, the manager at the time.  I have known Jeff from taking my cars into him when he worked at a Michelin place on Bannock St. in the late 70's.  Jeff then worked for Jim Paris at the current location and bought it many years ago.  He has stayed open and applied for a small business loan as soon as they were available but still was too late as the money ran out.  There is not a more honest, personable, capable, person out there, no matter what you think of your person.  One time I had an issue with some part and it was out of warranty.  Jeff sent me a check to reimburse me notwithstanding that he owed me nothing.  He knows all his customers by first name and always has a smile. He needs your work now.  Few people are driving so when the stay at home order expires, no one will need oil changes, new tires and other automotive repairs (he does almost everything not just tires) for some time.  Please think of Jeff and his loyal employees-- he is paying them, and somehow keeping them working, albeit little business and he doesn't expect business to pick up for some time.  Please support your local independent business person and not the chains.  If you tell Jeff I referred you, I will get nothing, you will get great service with no discount and maybe even a higher bill because you know me.  There is no other business I have ever given as much money to over the years and felt good about it.  Please don't tell him that or he will end up owning my first born son."

Dear Friend of Goodwill,

Like many Coloradans, Goodwill has demonstrated its ability to adapt to a fast-changing landscape. The COVID-19 pandemic facing the country has had a profound impact on charitable organizations like Goodwill to provide services in an unprecedented manner. We cannot do this without you! Please donate today!

Goodwill is more than a retail store; it is a crucial resource that provides workforce development programs to our community, and our services are needed now more than ever as many of our neighbors face significant financial hardships. The closing of our retail locations has led to a perilous loss in revenue. Your support is needed now more than ever.

Goodwill continues to donate clothing to shelters for homeless individuals, and is laundering and donating medical scrubs. In addition, we are continuing many of our mission programs to help individuals achieve greater independence—especially important during these uncertain times. Most recently, Goodwill has begun to collect PPE and canned goods at our store donation centers for Colorado's Office of Emergency Management. Your financial contribution will aid in our ability to continue to meet the needs of our community.

Please show your support and give now to help Goodwill extend our mission to more Coloradans. Your generosity will help individuals stay healthy and safe, and experience greater independence.

We deeply appreciate your support, thank you!

﻿Sincerely,

Karla Grazier, President and CEO"

This is truly an unprecedented time. I was wrong. Like many people in healthcare, I scoffed at those taking this now pandemic so seriously when it seemed like the flu is serious every year and we can't even get people to get their flu shot or wash their hands. We were given tables of data showing how the flu has a higher mortality rate and initially looked at this like it was just another thing. But now it is very clear that this is not going away. And it has the potential to completely overwhelm our healthcare system. I don't say any of this to encourage or condone panic. Panic and hoarding is the last thing that anyone should do. Let's all come together and help the most vulnerable among us.

Starting tomorrow 3/16 we will deliver any prescriptions for free. We will work with your insurance company to get longer day supplies if needed. We will be posting on social media whenever we get vital supplies in like hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies. And we would like to coordinate volunteers for grocery shopping for folks that need it. We will regularly wipe down all surfaces at the pharmacy and do our best to keep it as safe as possible. What else can we do for you Congress Park??? Tell us the need and let's all solve it together.

I'm already aware of one need. For doctors, pharmacists, nurses, etc....anyone on the front lines....we need help with our kids. And we can't have a ton of kids at one place because that defeats the purpose of social distancing to flatten the curve. So if you have a neighbor that's a first responder that has to go to work, and you yourself are not a vulnerable population, offer to help that family. This is a vital contribution you could be making if you are not able to work and are healthy. How else can we all think to help?? I'm so interested to hear your responses. And please, feel free to call and ask for help. I have so many wonderful patients that want to help others. We can connect people with the resources they need.

Your pharmacist and neighbor,
