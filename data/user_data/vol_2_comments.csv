1,186113992,Andrew Walvoord,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,4 days ago,Why not? Why should the city be putting homeless encampments in the middle of residential neighborhoods when they could have easily put them in places like the National Western grounds or the Rockies‚Äô parking lots?
2,186113992,Jessica Wood,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,4 days ago,I think we should have least been asked before this went into effect.

10,186113992,Billie Caldwell,‚Ä¢ Hutchinson Park,3 days ago,"There is a child care facility in this church.  Would you want to walk your child through a homeless encampment? And in this particular encampment, there are no restrictions against smoking, alcohol or drug use."
11,186113992,Adelina Gonzales,‚Ä¢ West Colfax,3 days ago,Maybe if a child was exposed to what life is really like & not shielded from everything then they wouldn't grow up so privileged & hateful. If this church was actually teaching the bible then what happened to Love Thy Neighbor? It's not love thy neighbor unless they are houseless.
12,186113992,Lee Farver,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 days ago,Exactly so they shouldn‚Äôt be able to impose anything like this within an area where people do
13,186113992,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,3 days ago,"If you don‚Äôt like it, go start a federal/state campaign to strip all churches of their tax-exempt status. But be sure to tell everyone why you‚Äôre fired up about it."
14,186113992,Adelina Gonzales,‚Ä¢ West Colfax,3 days ago,The worst part is they also claim it's due to lack of parking for the church which pushes churchgoers into parking in front their homes. So they don't want people who attend church near their homes either? ü§£ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

21,186113992,Ossie R.,‚Ä¢ Alamo Placita,3 days ago,People want to help as long as it‚Äôs not in their backyard
22,186113992,Diane Mandile,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 days ago,Ossie R. Reading through this thread I'm not sure I'd even agree that people want to help. Some are so disgusted by these human beings that they don't seem to care what happens to them as long as they don't have to deal with it in their neighborhood.
23,186113992,John S.,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,3 days ago,I understand the point of those advocating for compassion...but this isn‚Äôt the right manifestation of it. The people who live in the neighborhood and send their kids to school there should also have there rights a safe environment respected.

26,186113992,Larry M.,‚Ä¢ Highland,3 days ago,I don't understand where these homeless people were living before now.  There has been a moratorium pretty much nationwide against evictions and foreclosures.  Which implies that nobody has been recently displaced in the last year.    
27,186113992,Nate T.,‚Ä¢ Highland,3 days ago,"The key word here is implies.  But it‚Äôs not the truth, plenty of people have been kicked out of their apartments in the last year. They can‚Äôt afford legal fees to fight for their apartment."

30,186113992,Holley Kaufman,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,3 days ago,I wish the US had more mental health help. I mean where are all these people supposed to go that need help? Also why doesn‚Äôt the city find a place to build miniature houses to get some of them back on their feet or the counseling they need?
31,186113992,anna gross,‚Ä¢ Eastmoor Park,3 days ago,It's actually cheaper to do what you are recamending instead of keeping them homeless you can look it up !
32,186113992,anna gross,‚Ä¢ Eastmoor Park,3 days ago,"Fast fact to leave the average homeless person on the street cost roughly $40,000 per person. To house them and provide mental and physical support costs roughy $15,000 a year. I learned this at a rally at the Capitol a few years ago.( The dollar amount may be a little off but very close to what I stated)  It's actually saves tax payers money to house the homeless and give them skills and the ability to be clean and get hired than it does to leave them on the streets.a very good friend of mine runs one of these sights. many of the homeless that take advantage of these camps are our vets and our disabled homeless and our mentality ill. The ones that need it!  The people that cause the crimes are the druggies not the bulk of the homeless population. And the drug users usually don't even have it together enough to get into places like this. These people are actually to improve their lives. If people would actually take some time to get to know the people in the camps before insisting these people are going to hurt there kids( which is a bit of an over reach ) they would come to see the difference. There are alot of criminals on the streets but they are different that alot of the homeless population. I'm not saying criminals cannot be homeless because of course they can be however the people at these camps just want some help and supervision at least at the camp my friend supervises that's what I have seen first hand. Majority or the population is older or mentality ill or disabled and trying to get some help . The criminals are running the streets while these people sleep quietly in there tents !"
33,186113992,Terry H.,‚Ä¢ Golden Triangle,3d,"Anna - while I agree that those that want help should be able to get it, there are many options already that exist in Denver. See https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Departments/Department-of-Housing-Stability/Resident-Resources.  Where I live, we have a different problem.  Most of the people in the street tents are mostly young men (and some women) who are hard core drug addicts who do heroin and meth all day.  I have never seen a single child in any of these tents in our neighborhood, and I see them in the alley right outside my bedroom window every day.  I also met with the Denver Police this week, and the police confirmed they are ""service resistant"" people meaning that they are offered mental health, drug treatment, and housing support every day and they refuse.  They instead want the ""freedom"" to live in a tent, do drugs, and not have to change.  People (many from churches) bring them food to eat every day.  I saw a van full of nuns do this last week.  The drug tents remain in neighborhoods who are terrorized by these people every day with open drug use, public deification, completely blocked sidewalks, urination, stolen bicycles, car theft, prostitution, yelling in the middle of the night, etc..  I have been the victim of this crime with 7 of these illegal drug tent ""communities"" within 1 block of me for over the last year.  Trust me, you do not want to have to live with this!  Last year someone was stabbed right on my block next to a child care center in daylight hours.  This is real and not made up.  While the Denver Health Department does ""clean up"" or sweep these illegal drug tents, it can take months for them to do so.  However, the people just move down the street and set up their tents again, and stay in the new location for months, causing havoc at the new location.  While there is an urban camping ban, the police and Denver Heath Department have many restrictions now (at least 1 week notice, search warrant to even open a tent, public heath impact assessments, etc.)  The police told us that there is an 8 page ""protocol"" document they must follow to deal with with an encampment.  Most of this is due to a lawsuit that the ""pro-tent"" people won in court.  Also, Denver has made heroin and meth use a misdemeanor, so the police don't even bother arresting people for this anymore.  The word is out in the ""drug culture"" community that Denver is a great place to settle  in a tent.  People feed you all day, you get cheap and easy assess to your drugs, and the police will do nothing to stop you!  You might have to move your tent every few months, but the weather is great, except in the winter!  The only way to stop a drug tent community is to put up fencing (or big rocks, or other defensive architecture) to make it impossible for these folks to pitch a tent on your street or on your property.(edited)"

35,186113992,Damon Thomas,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,3 days ago,Maybe ask the indigenous Americans how well reservations have worked for them.   Funding substance abuse  and mental health treatment would help the majority of urban houseless far more than sending them to sanctioned reservations where substance abuse festers and the schizophrenic languish.

23,185885904,Sam Speight,‚Ä¢ North Side,2 days ago,"Leave it to the Jesuits to lead on the most destructive path possible. Whomever is in charge up there is following his jesuit oath faithfully. We create a really great neighborhood and the Jesuits on behalf of their Bolshevik ideologies are here to fuck it up under the virtue-signaling idiotic principles of wokeism. I predict a sharp rise in crime, a drop in small business ownership, a general mood of a dark cloud to settle in, a massive increase in drug trafficking as well as paraphernalia litter everywhere, except property value to make a significant drop, general violence to rise, squatters to start taking root and eventually this will be how you sell your homes for a fraction of what you bought it for. Regis will bring as many miscreants as possible to our back yards but I'll bet my right eye nothing beyond an attraction for drugs and crime is provided in this safe space. The homeless will move in and grow until it becomes an autonomous zone just like Portland. Welcome to the neighborhood people. The politics running at federal, state, local, and academics levels are in full force to achieving their goals to ruin everything good you've worked to obtain.  Don't believe me? Just wait. You will. Put a stop to this now or live with the memory that I told you so."

While the article poses good news in the few months since it opened, it'll be interesting to see if these camps have a lasting effect on the people who were helped by it. I certainly hope so. That being said, it still sucks that this new camp in question was set up without communication to park hill neighbors beforehand. Its an awful way to go about it."

Its intention is a temporary, safe, outdoor shelter. The problem of unaffordable housing and  n Denver is real folks! It is the leading cause of homelessness in Denver!  We as Park Hill residents are fortunate and fear shouldn't be the basis of our judgements. It is not intended to be a free-for-all ""encampment.""

17,183301151,Rachel Canning,‚Ä¢ City Park,13 Apr,"Hey, I know we all have different opinions on what leads to homelessness due to our own unique backgrounds, but I think it's best not to vilify an entire population of people. I understand they make you uncomfortable, but the reality is, our unhoused neighbors deserve compassion and respect just like our housed neighbors do. If you can't get on board with the camp, fine. At least let them have some peace, and don't make their lives even harder than they currently are. Just direct your focus elsewhere and let them be. And if you really don't want them there, you might like to consider how you could help them rather than fear mongering about their presence. Helping them feel empowered and safe is the best way to lessen the impact of our unhoused friends on neighborhoods. Everyone deserves safety, security, and respect, regardless of their housing status, their ability levels, whether or not they suffer from addiction, etc. There's really no room to argue on this."
18,183301151,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,20 Apr,"Thank you! I mean...look I get for the people of South Park Hill this really IS in their backyard. And they would've preferred a voice in the process (which I kind of read as the right to say no to it, which the church didn't ask for, the church just decided to do it. That's the church's own legal right as far as I can tell). But umm...it's happening. It's happening for 6 months, at a time when the people who will be in the Safe Outdoor Space really need it. It'd be nice to see the neighborhood come to grips with that and make the best of it instead of having a freakout over it. Just my two cents. Hope to see some of you all there volunteering at the site at some point."
19,183301151,Lynn Hartfield,‚Ä¢ City Park,13 Apr,"How about we both admit each side has a point? No one, no matter how sympathetic and well-intentioned, wants human beings living in tents on their front lawns, and that sentiment is magnified when the encampments come with drugs, trash, human waste, etc. The Safe Outdoor Spaces are trying to address an entrenched problem by providing spaces that can be maintained and providing services to the people living there. They will probably be very helpful to higher functioning people who have lost their housing due to financial problems, but they will likely not address the many people who are on the street due to mental health and drug problems (which often go together). Take a deep breath, all. This is a citywide problem, and  Cap Hill, RiNo and Curtis Park shouldn't have to bear it alone."

21,183301151,Jeff Peshut,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Apr,Does this so-called sanctioned encampment comply with Denver's zoning ordinance?  Do we know how many of the 50 people have previously owned or rented homes in Denver?  Will be there only temporarily as a result of temporary economic circumstances?  Suffer from some form of primary addiction?  Some form of chronic mental health condition? Some form of chronic physical health condition?  Have criminal records?  Have recently moved to Denver?  Were experiencing homelessness when they moved here?  Lots to know and understand.
22,183301151,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,13 Apr,"Do you really think you know about even your neighbors on any of those issues. Living in tents or houses doesn't change the fact you never know. Especially  people with money ,who can afford lawyers to get them off."
23,183301151,RoSean Howard,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Apr,"Anyone can be homeless, paying off doctors, education, lawyers, etc.  I am highly educated and yes, I have been homeless and not by my doing.  I also worked for the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless for little pay.  I know my clients did not deserve what happened to nearly all of them.  Drugs was an escape for the hopeless; many were very good, kind and caring people.  So, to remedy the trash, put more trash barrels out or recycle bins.  Let the camps be vested in the environment they live.  Right on to the Churches and donations that have gone above and beyond their abilities. Not all homeless are bad but like police, it only takes one or two bad guys to ruin a reputation.  Where can you send homeless people, anyway?  Any place can be bad or good.  Thanks to South Park Hill for getting out of the comfort zone and stepping up to help humanity.  Now, helping young teens becoming independent may reduce future houseless people, but there are no jobs when young ones are competing for the jobs older people need, and VOCATIONS are minimal or non-existent.  Simultaneously, we must work on current homeless and prevent further - and our country does a great job of segregating the poor from the wealthy.  I Love Park Hill because poor, hard working people and the wealthy people care, not just the old growth and old brick homes, but the diversity of my community.  I have lived here my whole life.  ...And, the new transplants join our thinking.  Thanks to you, too.  Thanks, Kozlowicz, NO fear-mongering."
24,183301151,Ana Gonzo,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,13 Apr,"RoSean Howard People are not fear-mongering as much as they are legitimately scared of the element of change a SOS can bring to their doorstep. The way to remedy, or at least lessen and sway people, is to inform not point fingers and all caps NIMBY at them. The website Tim Townsend posted is helpful and may sway some who are on the fence. Park Hill UM did the SOS a tremendous disservice by not getting ahead of the information. Try to remember, all of a sudden word got out a ""homeless encampment"" is being located in the middle of Park Hill. Neighbors are envisioning the encampments in and around Cap Hill that had rat infestation, super spreader events, criminal activity, etc. Being kind to everyone also encompasses those who are scared of how this will impact their neighborhood and lives, not just the homeless."
25,183301151,Cynthia Pesantez,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,13 Apr,"There but for the grace of God go I. Any one of us could be homeless in a city with astronomical housing prices and few safety nets. How many people lost jobs in the pandemic? How many lost housing due to banks and landlords‚Äô inflexibility once the pandemic hit? It could have been me. It could have been you. We have a responsibility to help our neighbors. My goodness we are so fortunate. I think every day how lucky I am to be fed, clothed, housed, with relative financial security. Don‚Äôt you? Don‚Äôt you ever look around your space and go, ‚Äúholy moly, am I lucky!‚Äù So many of our neighbors don‚Äôt have that. It‚Äôs not our place to judge each one asking why and how they are now unhoused. Instead, let‚Äôs help! Let‚Äôs volunteer at that church if they need it. Let‚Äôs offer odd jobs to those who want them. Let‚Äôs give of our abundance, share so more can have a little. Let us meet our unhoused neighbors with love and compassion, not fear and contempt. We are, all of us, human, and have erred in different ways. Some big some small. Some with the good fortune to bounce back, and some not. But we all deserve grace, and patience, and agency, and help. Don‚Äôt give in to fear. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of thinking you are so different from your unhoused neighbors. There but by the grace of God go we all."

32,183301151,Kelley Dawkins,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,13 Apr,It's wonderful to see a church helping to provide shelter and services to the homeless in a city where housing prices are astronomically high. It seems to me like they are living their Christian values.
33,183301151,Sara Lange,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Apr,"It seems to me they should shift their focus to reopening their church and school to in-person visits.  That is what people in the neighborhood understood they were moving near.  They understood the traffic, the schedules, the clientele that might frequent those places.  If UMC doesn't feel it's safe enough to open for school or worship, how can they safely take on the task of providing responsible housing?!"
34,183301151,Debby Schwartz,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,13 Apr,How about putting the camps in the Governors and Mayors backyards?????????
35,183301151,Drew Lavin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Apr,It will be a block from Senator Hickenlooper's house.
36,183301151,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Apr,"The backyard argument doesn't include the support services also necessary to pull someone out of homelessness. Perhaps talking with someone in that situation, understanding the trauma of living in a very unstable situation, and all that it takes to recover from it would help understanding. It's truly not a black-and-white situation. Some folks just don't ask for help until it's too late."
37,183301151,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,13 Apr,Please volunteer at the existing site before you make any judgements. They could use more volunteers.

39,183301151,Debby Schwartz,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,4w,I didn‚Äôt know we paid taxes to have homeless camps move in next door??? Be that as it May! What is the Governor and Mayor doing about this situation! Some of these people want to stay in tents and the ones that need help to transition out of the camps into housing should be taken care of so they can move on! The Governor and Mayor are ignoring this and just moving people are the city like Chess pieces !‚ôü‚ôü‚ôü(edited)

4,183906949,Jeanne Price,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,18 Apr,"Jim, does PHUMC need donations of any sort? Cash, food, Cleanup crews? If so, please post a list."
5,183906949,Scott Hughes,‚Ä¢ Hale,18 Apr,From what I read the proposed site will close December 31 and I didn't see anything about any commitment to relocate the inhabitants to at least equal accommodations. So there is the included mass forced eviction of the space on New Years Eve which would be violation of Article 25 of the UDHR. Another thing I think would be helpful is some structured organized activities available for the inhabitants like occupational therapy
6,183906949,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Apr,Scott have you read how the SOS/CVC works?
7,183906949,Sue Bruner,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Apr,Thank you Jim.

9,183906949,Joe Haynes,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Apr,I'm glad to hear your sane and humane voice on this.
10,183906949,Dani Tyler,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,19 Apr,It's not a 'near-by' children's center. The parking lot is where employees and parents park to drop off kids. The kitchen the kids eat in opens up to the parking lot as well as the gym they play in. I'm sure SOS camps are normally great and I fully support having one in the neighborhood but not at PHUMC.  Find a church that isn't also a preschool or look into one of the many unused parking lots a few blocks north just south of the highway.
11,183906949,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Apr,150 churches were offered this opportunity.
12,183906949,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,19 Apr,Proud of Park Hill and of posts like this! People: be sure to turn up for the meeting tonight and the May 1st one to spread the positivity!
13,183906949,Kevin and Catherine Cray,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Apr,"Having watched the neighborhood meetings for the Denver Community Church location and visiting with the manager of the Baptist Church location, I am convinced of the value to the residents and of the professional supervision of the sites. I am hoping that we will show hospitality to these new residents in Park Hill during their stay here. What a good opportunity to share some of the peace that Jim speaks of that we cherish in Park Hill. Gabe, please tell us more about how to join the meetings tonight and May 1st."

22,183906949,Sharon Kermiet,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Apr,I support PHUMC in this effort.  What they are doing is profound in the face of so much need.
23,183906949,Mary Groves,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,20 Apr,"My takeaway from the PHUMC presentation is this is an already established community living at the First Baptist Church downtown. It sounds like this community has already been screened and the antisocial contingent  have been screened out to a certain degree. Does that assure there won't be problems? No and there will be other homeless trying to join and some problems will occur. Does PHUMC deserve a chance to explore this community project? That's what we're exploring. Could the presentation have been more organized? Yes ,but that will come with experience. That is not what we are discussing ."

14,184201216,Zachary Fischer,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,21 Apr,"Littering is such a trashy thing to do. Honestly, it‚Äôs beyond lazy to throw trash on the ground when it can easily be disposed of in a trash can. C‚Äômon people."
15,184201216,Cam Gu,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,21 Apr,"Denver is by far the most littered city I have ever lived in... and I‚Äôm from New Orleans where they literally throw trash on the ground during Mardi Gras.... but it all gets picked up. A lot of it comes from the alley ways/it‚Äôs fall out from when trash is picked up/blows out of overfilled trash cans bc the squirrels rip the bags open. I wish that people were forced to bring their trash cans in from the alley way when the street sweepers come down them‚Äî bc a lot of the trash is stuck between cans and then blows out into the street. This is why I‚Äôm not a huge fan of alley way trash pick up‚Äî if trash pick up was in front of our homes, people are more likely to pick up garbage in their front yards that falls out of their trash cans, than they are in the alley wayüò≠üò≠"
16,184201216,Andrea Lauritzen,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,21 Apr,I've noticed the trash situation increasingly worse over this past year. I think I'll need to go back to pooch patrol where I walk our dog with some grabbers and a bag. Also it is becoming monotonous to constantly clean up our front yard every few days. I'm down if people want to put together a trash cleanup day!
17,184201216,Jeff Farquhar,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,21 Apr,Just wait till the tent city moves in! It‚Äôs going to get really bad.

I pass it every time I go to visit my mom. It's  on many street corners. They have to keep moving it around because it gets so nasty and dangerous. Why? Because the people who live there will not keep it clean/safe and the city of Denver lets it  happen ! I don't know who would want to visit this city when it is like this.  I don't go downtown unless I have to. My out of town friends have seen the mess on the national media."

12,182618509,Lee Farver,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Apr,"Before People call me ""Privileged"" I grew up poor.  My parents had me when they were 18 and we lived in trailer parks as well as an actual camper when I was young.  My parents didn't do drugs, they just had kids too young with no money. They didn't use excuses, they didn't take any handouts, they worked their butts off and saved every penny that didn't go to supporting their kids.  They taught me and my brother what hard work could do.  When I first moved to Denver I moved to the highlands when things were still rough.  I had compassion and would give food or a few bucks to the homeless that sat out on the corners around the major intersections in the neighborhood. That compassion soon faded as I would head out on a run down the cherry creek trail every evening after work and see the same people i tried to help talking to drug dealers on that same trail or literally had needles in their arms as i ran by.  I had my first kid living in that house in the highlands and didn't feel safe running with a stroller down the cherry creek trail with her in it.  As much as i loved that house and neighborhood I CHOSE to move to Park hill for a more stable and safe environment.  So now that I feel like a choice was made for my neighborhood without any consideration i can be angry.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for many of years.  There are jobs out there people even during this pandemic. However, you have to be reliable, hard working, and straight.  So before you all start judging me I will pose this offer.  For any of you that believe this is a good thing and support decisions like this being made without any neighborhood involvement my offer is this:  I will buy anyone that is willing to have a homeless family camp in their back yard for a period of time a nice tent, i'll pay for the utilities, and some additional amenities if you're willing to put my money where your mouth is and support these same people living in your backyard.  Because honestly, the parking lot is in the backyard of people that live on that street."

Again I‚Äôm very happy she found her way home. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
21,184713659,Amber Demetry,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,25 Apr,We were parked next to you in the silver car at DFL. We were laughing because she insisted on sitting on your lap. So nice to see such caring and patient people like yourself.
22,184713659,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,26 Apr,Get her chipped!!!!!!
23,184713659,Tenisha McClain,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,26 Apr,Got her chipped this morning!!
24,184713659,Dana Arvin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,26 Apr,Homeless people are steeling dogs and selling them.  I hope you get her back.  lock your gates.
25,184713659,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,28 Apr,Good job getting her chipped!!!  I had a dog picked up by the ‚ÄúDog Catcher‚Äù.  She had a DFL tag and was chipped so they took her to DFL instead of the pound.  I got a call right a way.

1,181416850,Rachel Kennedy,‚Ä¢ Central Park,26 Mar,Thank you for the suggestion! I will check them out
2,181416850,Jacqueline Bell,‚Ä¢ Central Park,26 Mar,Please consider donating the blankets to Laura Avant. She delivers them to the homeless. They can be dropped off at my house for her. 
3,181416850,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,26 Mar,I second Jackie's recommendations bc I go to 2 shelters each time I have a car.full. Will be real busy  doing homeless laundry until Wednesday if you can hold them for a few days. Then I'll take them down town.
4,181416850,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,5 Apr,"If you still have some blankets, I am still taking things to the shelters.  I will be making two trips tomorrow to take all of the nice things that Heidi Harris and her brother brought me on Thursday but will be sorting and prepping more then too.  I only have one blanket I found in the trash to take.  It is perfect, so I don't understand people sometimes."

0,182732086,Jeff Winchester,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,I couldn‚Äôt agree more! This is very disturbing news.
1,182732086,Samantha Robles,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Apr,Time to move. Disgusting
2,182732086,Valerie Carter,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Apr,From the article: Chandler said the collaborative has been in contact with the local neighborhood organizations including Greater Park Hill Community Inc. and will host two community meetings in May to provide more details about the site. The collaborative is also inviting people to tour the existing site on Pearl Street to see how they operate.
3,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Don‚Äôt care how they operate on pearl street... don‚Äôt want it on montview street
4,182732086,Michael Davis,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,"Are you familiar with the monitored homeless camp downtown by the capital? If not, please do your research, it will basically be the same thing.  It isnt a tent city with zero supervision."
5,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,"Really... yes I am familiar and also familiar with the dirty needles, filth, unsafe and unsanitary conditions!  Why don‚Äôt you volunteer to put it in your back yard?"
6,182732086,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,"As a volunteer with the Women's Homelessness Initiative and after many visits to the 14th & Grant site to deliver food and water, it is well operated. One of my fellow Park Hill UCC church members volunteered overnight there from 11 pm to 3am, and she, a physician, says it was orderly. The fence is tall, and there is a locked gate. If we need extra monitoring around the perimeter, let's talk with the PH Methodist Church about this as well as determine if additional monitoring is necessary. We can also have our Forest Avenue Parkway patrolled if people are concerned. Ultimately, people using this SOS site are like us and deserve safe shelter until other options are available in our severely overpriced and underserved city. Where else do these people go? The SOS site is safe, quiet, and well managed. We all want safe neighborhoods and living spaces. If there is a concern with what is around it, then contact the local police precinct for additional patrols. The people within the SOS site are peaceful. It is a 6 month permit. Also keep in mind that Senator Hickenlooper resides 1.5 blocks from it. Since we can't build affordable housing fast enough, where do unhoused neighbors go?"
7,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Please!
8,182732086,Patty Moody,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,How much is the collaborative group paying this church?  Also are they ensuring no sex offenders are living by the school?  Needle disposals?  üò°
9,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Absolutely!  Great question
10,182732086,Jim Miller,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,7 Apr,Take a walk up Park from Colfax to Larimer..and then back on 22nd. That is what will be coming to your neighborhood
11,182732086,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,7 Apr,"How about 14th close to downtown? Right on the sidewalks , in front of homes and businesses. I wouldn't feel safe walking down there , nor having my kids walk down there"
12,182732086,Michael Davis,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,I highly encourage all to find out how these people qualify.  It took almost 30 days to fill the camp on Grant.  Not just everyone can come in whenever they want.
13,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Qualify?  Who cares about qualification... just don‚Äôt want it period!
14,182732086,Debra Roads,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,7 Apr,Go visit the tent camp on Pearl street. The tent camp is run really well and the residents are so nice. My neighbors and I have made dinner and delivered it to their 40 residents.  I live in Congress Park and would be so proud if we would do this too.
15,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,God Bless you... keep up the good work
16,182732086,Scott Bulfin,‚Ä¢ Central Park,7 Apr,"It doesn't make you a bad or uncaring person to not want a homeless camp where you live. It is a serious issue that needs to be resolved and rotating these camps from Denver neighborhood to neighborhood is not a solution, just a bandaid. I would suggest the city of Denver take the $100 million  it is getting from the economic windfall boost of getting the 2021 MLB ALL-STAR game from Atlanta and now to Denver and invest it in solving the revolving homeless camp issue. Also all cities/states are getting a windfall from Biden's 2 trillion aid package, so some of that surplus can go to tackling the homeless camp issue."
17,182732086,Heather Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Seems like Hancock would want to cleanup the downtown area before the ALL STAR game so I predict we‚Äôll see more of this moving into neighborhoods.
18,182732086,Erin Pier,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,7 Apr,"There was a homeless man who used to wander around my block. I‚Äôd see him from time to time and we‚Äôd chat. He was one of the kindest people I‚Äôve ever met...former PTA president at one of our neighborhood schools, and the father of three successful adults - one rather well known. He was brilliant, but ill, and our country failed to meet his needs. So he wound up sorting through my dumpster looking for scrap metal to make ends meet. "
19,182732086,Jeff Winchester,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Wake up Erin.  Because we don‚Äôt want human feces and needles next door to a preschool is not too much to ask. This is BS and you know it! Yes Denver is an expensive city to live in. Guess what? Other places are more affordable. They live here because suckers like you enable them. Shame on you.
20,182732086,Melody Hodges,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Apr,"Some people work awfully hard to hold onto their preconceived notions, even when faced with evidence they are wrong.  So sad to see such closed minds, so much unfounded fear and the unwillingness to learn or contribute."
21,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,What does that even mean? You do not know me or my past contributions to society!  I am all about helping others!   The issue is we are exposing innocent children and families to something they did not choose to be exposed to!  Wasn‚Äôt our/their choice.. that‚Äôs the issue!  We all deserve to have a choice and say in our lives...
22,182732086,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Apr,So where would you like to home them?
23,182732086,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Apr,"Jeff Farquhar  I  Myself no Jeff. I have a roof over my head. but you are the same people who go don't pay rent. Pay housekeepers a $100000 a year to clean their homes. We the people, Find a solution. You go poor people until it comes to your house.  There are schools in every neighborhood. There are young children in every neighborhood. Find a solution. Work together to find a way to get these people off the drugs that need help. Work programs. It will get worse before it gets better. Find ways to help instead of being a just not on my door complainer!"
24,182732086,Jan Delsi,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Apr,"I am also concerned, if the legislators think this is such a wonderful idea, then they should have them set up the camps near their homes, not ours!!!"
25,182732086,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,It‚Äôs near Senator Hickenlooper‚Äôs home.
26,182732086,Michael King,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,"Don‚Äôt know.. your backyard?  Not mine or our local church, or nearby neighbors.  Don‚Äôt know the answer.. it‚Äôs sucks, feel bad for all.  Think ultimately up to our local gov, but they only push this kind of crap through under radar without most knowing anything about it.. is that ok?  No it is not.  I am done bitching, no real solution other than voicing our opinion..  Good luck to all with this terrible situation"
27,182732086,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Apr,Stop complaining and misinforming. Do your homework and be part of the solution.
28,182732086,Jeff Farquhar,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,7 Apr,Patricia Smith I‚Äôm about done with your misinforming. We aren‚Äôt idiots!! We‚Äôve seen these camps! See ya at the tour on May 1st Pattie.
29,182732086,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4w,Dispense with the personal attacks. I work and have volunteered for 4 years. Get to work on the solutions and get informed. I too don‚Äôt want drug dealers and unsafe conditions. Learn the difference.(edited)
30,182732086,Ingrid Underwood,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4w,It‚Äôs a catch22.  I understand the homeless situation must be addressed.  We have spoken to several homeless people living in their cars and watched the documentary Tent City USA.  
31,182732086,Max Blanchard,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,4w,"I want to thank Patricia Smith and Michael Davis for the information they provided about the safe outdoor space. I think it‚Äôs fair to be apprehensive but from what I have read about the official outdoor space in Cap Hill, it sounds like it was successful in helping people escape homelessness. And the concerns people had at the start were squashed once the program began. Trying to avoid the not in my backyard mentality (NIMBYism) can be tough, but I‚Äôm happy to know our city is at least trying to help people.(edited)"
32,182732086,Melody Hodges,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Apr,"Thinking the camp at the church will be like the camp at Morley is comparing apples and oranges.  Why the difference is so difficult to comprehend is beyond me.  More camps like the one at the church means fewer camps like Morley.  That's the whole point of this, to help people while keeping them safe from the neighborhood and vice versa.  The reality is that the homeless keep coming and the problem will most likely get worse before it gets better once the eviction moratorium is lifted.  People need hope to recover and the sanctioned camps offer that.  Without hope, people turn to drugs and other activities that drag them into places like the camp at Morley.  They're not necessarily bad people, just people that have had bad things happen to them.  It's not right to deny them the opportunity to pull themselves out of a dire situation by denying them a camp like the sanctioned ones which offer hope and a way out, and instead warehouse them somewhere where you don't have to see them.  This camp isn't being placed in Park Hill to punish the neighborhood - I believe the intent it to spread them throughout the city so all neighborhoods share in the recovery."
33,182732086,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,8 Apr,"I agree there is no comparison to SOS and Morey. It's important that we determine how to avoid that situation, and also to keep in mind how we can show how it's possible to make this work."

13,182464076,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,9 Apr,"Dear Neighbors, our cherished Park Hill has a long history of coming together to serve social justice. Anyone remember the Ghost Post program from 1993/1994? This is the Park Hill I know and where I am proud to live. People have come together for decades, and we are again capable of this. Who participated in the Ghost Post program to keep Halloween safe? The first year we did it, we had brick mobile phones (1994), which my boss donated in the days she worked at Cellular One so each block could immediately report a disturbance. When we come together to participate, it lightens the load. https://denver.cbslocal.com/2018/10/31/ghost-post-park-hill-halloween/"
14,182464076,Ann Salamy,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,9 Apr,Providing additional information received via email today:
15,182464076,Jan Nadav,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,12 Apr,"FYI -- Only one neighbor was contacted and very briefly at that,  on Glencoe the Friday before Easter."
16,182464076,Lee Farver,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Apr,"Before People call me ""Privileged"" I grew up poor.  My parents had me when they were 18 and we lived in trailer parks as well as an actual camper when I was young.  My parents didn't do drugs, they just had kids too young with no money. They didn't use excuses, they didn't take any handouts, they worked their butts off and saved every penny that didn't go to supporting their kids.  They taught me and my brother what hard work could do.  When I first moved to Denver I moved to the highlands when things were still rough.  I had compassion and would give food or a few bucks to the homeless that sat out on the corners around the major intersections in the neighborhood. That compassion soon faded as I would head out on a run down the cherry creek trail every evening after work and see the same people i tried to help talking to drug dealers on that same trail or literally had needles in their arms as i ran by.  I had my first kid living in that house in the highlands and didn't feel safe running with a stroller down the cherry creek trail with her in it.  As much as i loved that house and neighborhood I CHOSE to move to Park hill for a more stable and safe environment.  So now that I feel like a choice was made for my neighborhood without any consideration i can be angry.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for many of years.  There are jobs out there people even during this pandemic. However, you have to be reliable, hard working, and straight.  So before you all start judging me I will pose this offer.  For any of you that believe this is a good thing and support decisions like this being made without any neighborhood involvement my offer is this:  I will buy anyone that is willing to have a homeless family camp in their back yard for a period of time a nice tent, i'll pay for the utilities, and some additional amenities if you're willing to put my money where your mouth is and support these same people living in your backyard.  Because honestly, the parking lot is in the backyard of people that live on that street."

19,182464076,Eve Cohen,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,11 Apr,"You are being ridiculous. The point of the SOS‚Äôs (as you would know if you had read the description of them, which you clearly have not), is that it‚Äôs not just sticking someone in a tent in a backyard (or parking lot); it‚Äôs connecting them to services such as mental health counseling, job training, and housing resources, providing showers, bathrooms, heating, and electricity, and the end goal is transitioning these people into permanent housing, which the project has had enormous success with. Many of the people housed in the SOS‚Äôs actually have jobs, they just don‚Äôt make enough to be able to afford rent, which, if you‚Äôve looked at Denver rents lately, you‚Äôd understand why.  Please educate yourself about what this project is and how it works before vocalizing your prejudices and preconceptions."

6,186193936,Brian Ginnow,‚Ä¢ Commerce City,2 days ago,"Every time somebody complains about cats in their yard I give you a solution that really works but most of the time nobody listens.  Everyone knows cats don‚Äôt like getting wet.  There is a device called a scarecrow.  It is a sprinkler with a battery operated motion sensor on it.  You put batteries in it, you hook your hose to it, you set it up so it is pointing at the garden beds, and you turn on the water.  Your plants get  a little extra water and every time the cats come into the detection area it scares them away.  After a couple of weeks you turn off the water.  If you have a game camera you have it cover the same area.  Check the camera regularly and as soon as it starts seeing the cats coming back you turn the hose back on.  Eventually most of the cats won‚Äôt go into that area because it trains them to avoid that area.  You don‚Äôt need to be cruel towards the cats or upset the cat lovers, you just need to train the cats to avoid your yard.  Last time I checked a scarecrow was cheaper than a good quality trap. If you know which neighbors are cat lovers consider talking to them about what resources they need help with to trap the cats to have them spayed or neutered, and if you are able to help do so, so that over time the feral cats stop being such a problem."
7,186193936,Jessica Patterson,‚Ä¢ Aurora,2 days ago,"Brian G. I agree. I'm having same issue as OP but have turned my hose is on the cats a few times, thankfully those in my yard don't immediately run off. Just a few sprays in the yard and a few times spraying the fence when I saw them approaching my yard and significant less cats visiting my garden beds. Now thinking about getting a motion activated sprinkler like you mentioned for more regular ""cat maintenance"""
8,186193936,Katherine Carrara,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,7 hr ago,Jessica Patterson there's also canisters that blow air at them. They don't like it but it's totally safe
9,186193936,Kate Petersen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,2 days ago,I had that problem last summer and someone suggested putting shells on my garden. Oddly enough I had a bucket of oyster shells so I spread them around. Cats disappeared I guess they don‚Äôt like walking on them. Whatever the reason they left my garden alone after that. I put them back out this year just in case.

12,186193936,Barbara Penn,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,2 days ago,"A trick I learned years ago, is to put down aluminum foil where he enters.  Depends on how your yard designed, if you have fence, you have an idea where they enter, but the main point is that cats hate aluminum foil!!!  If they are digging in your garden, same thing, just put foil down with a little dirt over it and as soon as they start to dig they are outta there!"

31,141220585,Christopher J.,‚Ä¢ Westminster Hills,1y,Hey Tom. Up in the NW burbs. We had so many people looking for and seeking help. One started a group to help neighbors in need get help. It's been awesome to see how quickly any need is responded to.  Often by more than a few offering to help. It's awesome to see people put aside all other considerations (race/religion/politics/social status) and just be neighbors and Americans. Please check it out for yourself (if you're able)https://nextdoor.com/g/h14shobyd/(edited)
32,141220585,"Tom Green, 9NEWS",,21 Mar 20,Good stuff Christopher...I think people helping each other will really surge.  I'm hoping that by sharing these stories we can help it grow - and give folks an idea of the ways that they can help.

As for the rest of your post it is common sense. I have been capable of making it through life for many many years without the need for the government telling me how to do things as have many others. Why would I take advice from the government when they can't manage nor spend money wisely. I could go into many areas where the government is lacking from the city to the federal level. The main purpose of government is to protect the citizens but currently the government seems to think they are in the business of running our lives and making money.

0,139471884,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Mar 20,What about everyone else who has been waitlisted for low income housing because they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúartists‚Äù? üòï
1,139471884,Sharon Duwaik,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,24 Feb,Artists are usually low-income.
2,139471884,Elizabeth Teng,‚Ä¢ Lowry,24 Feb,Sharon Duwaik that is correct. It is also better for community and oftentimes for the art itself when they are grouped together. I do wonder how artist is being defined in this context.
3,139471884,Will Hofsess,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Mar 20,"Everybody is an artist. I can‚Äôt draw a strait line, but by using mon art as a second language tool I discovered my own talents as well as my pupils"
4,139471884,Andrea Gingerich,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,24 Feb,mon art?
5,139471884,Scott Raber,‚Ä¢ Central Park,6 Mar 20,"Artist bring culture and add uniqueness to neighborhoods. Of course we can‚Äôt have too many of these over supporting non-artists, but this is cool to see."

13,139471884,Sharon Duwaik,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,24 Feb,"There is a lot of housing for homeless vets (not enough to be sure)...in Aurora and Denver, etc"
14,139471884,Sharon Duwaik,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,24 Feb,"The idea of housing for Artists, is to encourage a creative component to a neighborhood.  Often an Arts community helps spur economic changes to a neighborhood.  Think of Lo-do, RiNO neighborhood, and even 5-Points.  the trick of creating an arts district is not to gentrify so much that all diverse income earners can live there."
15,139471884,Elizabeth Teng,‚Ä¢ Lowry,24 Feb,"But the gentrification will follow anyway unfortunately. As the art historian Thomas Crow said ‚ÄúArtists are the Research and Development Arm of the Culture Industry.‚Äù With that said, it is so easy to change an eyesore with a little paint.  We shouldn‚Äôt keep things ugly and unused just to keep the surrounding area market cheap like the blight at 1100 Yosemite Street for example."
16,139471884,Mark Yaw,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,10w,That corner is certainly bound to be better than it was in the 2010s! What a pit.(edited)

3,175331575,Kelsey Kistler,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,29 Jan,I don't think so. She had her hood up so I can't say definitively.
4,175331575,Heather Mann,‚Ä¢ Central Park,29 Jan,My friend who lives there said a woman with pink hair stole her expensive chairs off her porch.  It happened here in Stapleton too same woman took the same style chairs ... She even had the nerve to sit on the chairs first before she took them !!!!
5,175331575,Sharon Duwaik,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,29 Jan,"I live further East off Colfax and I don't know why but people do it all the time.

18,175331575,Kelsey Kistler,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,30 Jan,Do you let the homeowner know what you‚Äôre doing when you do this?
19,175331575,Dorothy Hotchkiss,‚Ä¢ Hale,30 Jan,"Unfortunately sometimes this strange behavior happens, and honestly my kids always get upset with me bc I would have asked her if she was ok..probably would have offered her food and water..ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
20,175331575,Heather Mann,‚Ä¢ Central Park,30 Jan,It‚Äôs sad but unfortunately now a days you can‚Äôt always do that because the last time my friend did that the person tried to attack my friend and she got a huge cut on her arm - sometimes they can be on drugs or mentally Ill and u have to protect your home and your kids and open your doors to strangers like that.  But yea hopefully she was ok.

23,175331575,Anne Delphia,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,30 Jan,"Stefanie Bell yep you are right.  Everyone thought because the city called it group living was it benefits those who want to live more to a home.  NOT TRUE!  This is ONLY for those who get paid by the city and the state to house felons and homeless in our homes in our neighborhoods for them to profit and profit BIG TIME.  They can make up to a $1000 per felon per month in a home and if they are allowed to have five in a home then they get $5000 a month.  How is anyone trying to rent going to compete with that?

3,184908340,Florence Sebern,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,28 Apr,"Interesting article this morning in BusinessDen. It appears the City is headed toward outsource and contract (again) with a quasi-municipal corporation and a land-banking non-profit. This model of outsourcing is certainly lucrative for the contractors, but the bill to taxpayers keeps increasing and the outcomes do not appear satisfactory. "

24,182347254,Ken Lipkowitz,‚Ä¢ Central Park,5 Apr,Something like that happened to me in Arlington Virginia (an affluent suburb of Washington DC). It was a $20 in the driveway several blocks from my house. I put the bill under the windshield wiper of the car in the driveway (a Mercedes) and walked to work patting myself on the back about how honest I am. But later I realized I am well-off enough to be able to afford to do that. I am not sure what I would do if I were truly needy. Hopefully the same thing but maybe not.

26,177737993,Bonnie Liu,‚Ä¢ Lowry,20 Feb,Love Basil Doc‚Äôs! Yum!!
27,177737993,Anne Hines,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,20 Feb,"My great friend got thru a grueling round of chemo, had her surgery, and her margins were clean.  I'm over the moon for her!"
28,177737993,Daniel Webb,‚Ä¢ Lowry,20 Feb,Here‚Äôs hoping she stays healthy
29,177737993,Joe F.,‚Ä¢ Cedar Cove,20 Feb,"The doctors tell me I'm on course to get my leukemia in remission by the end of May. However, the cancer can never be completely eradicated from one's body."
30,177737993,Ilene Warneke,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,20 Feb,"Daniel, I hope you find your joy. It‚Äôs in the simple things around you and you don‚Äôt need to leave home to find it. The sun is shining. Taking a walk can be a spiritual thing (as long as you are careful of the crazy drivers!). Having coffee/talk with your family if you are lucky enough to have them close. And hugs. Lots of hugs!"
31,177737993,Joe F.,‚Ä¢ Cedar Cove,20 Feb,I'm willing to bet Daniel has lots of joy.
32,177737993,Jacqueline Bell,‚Ä¢ Central Park,20 Feb,A young single mom made it to Inpatient psychiatric services before she took her life. Praise God
33,177737993,Katherine Carrara,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,20 Feb,I met many neighbors with my post about using my yard and played with a dog and a 3 year old yesterday. We spun around until we got dizzy. Natural high.  Goodness is everywhere.
34,177737993,Vivian VanArsdale,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,20 Feb,You're right complaining distress negative things and takes you deeper into a hole so yes I am grateful for every moment I have neighbors that take care of me shovel my walk help me wake my yard bring me food if they don't hear from me check on me if my car has been out in the driveway too long without being moved I'm truly truly blessed. Monday when the high was 13 degrees I was driving my car to keep it warm and I saw a gentleman walking from King Soopers over on Mississippi possibly and going home with groceries and you can see in one of them was milk plus his heart.so of course I pulled over and asked him if I could take him home because it was so cold and I didn't want him to get frostbite and I couldn't imagine what his fingers were feeling like. Of course he accepted my offer I took him home we talked for a few minutes to let him warm up a little bit more before he had to go outside and do the cold to get into the door and we exchanged numbers. as long as it's cold I'm going to call him and see if he needs a ride so he doesn't have to walk anymore but the other day he called me and took me to lunch. Kindness generally brings back kindness and so life is great we all need to stop complaining and look at the good things . Trust me when I was younger I could walk run and do all kinds of things and now I can barely walk walking alone is such a blessing.
35,177737993,Tatiana Giackino,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,20 Feb,Check out Food For Thoughtfulness. This group is doing an awesome job feeding families that are food insecure and just need a little help. Right now we are feeding 200 or so individuals.  
0,180883098,jeff muro,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,21 Mar,"I've seen it for close to a year, it's a real shame. And there are some trash cans in that area, it looks like they have trash pick up once a week"
1,180883098,Tara Trujillo,‚Ä¢ Lyn Knoll,21 Mar,There is a city council meeting tomorrow with public comment time.  https://www.auroragov.org/city_hall/mayor___city_council/council_meetings
2,180883098,Bianca Sanchez,‚Ä¢ Summerglenn,22 Mar,It looks like skid row. There are plenty of homeless shelters available. No one wants to be clean and sober to be able to use one. It‚Äôs no ones fault but themselves. These junkies need to get out of here
3,180883098,Sara Loveless,‚Ä¢ Lyn Knoll,22 Mar,"Actually, there aren't enough shelters.  I work with the homeless and I can tell you for a fact that Aurora and Boulder regularly send people to Denver because they're full.  The answer isn't to keep pushing them out to different cities and counties but get involved and fight for change with your boots on the ground.  I encourage everyone to make their voice heard at the city council meeting.  Keep in mind, these ""junkies, bums, vagabonds"" or whatever derogatory term you want to use for them, are first and foremost human beings with all the faults and weaknesses as everyone else.  They were once someone's baby, child.  They are still someone's loved one, whether they know it or not.  Be the voice of change and love."
4,180883098,Manizheh Patterson,‚Ä¢ Del Mar North,22 Mar,Sara Loveless Thank you for bringing it back to people and kindness.
5,180883098,Jodi Garza,‚Ä¢ Sable Altura Chambers,22 Mar,There should be trash cans there that get emptied weekly. Sadly though I see more people throwing trash out of their cars  than anything...   it's funny to say and see that the Colfax under pass is cleaner...
6,180883098,Susan Turner,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,22 Mar,Just think where they are using a bathroom portable potty would be nice to
7,180883098,Natalie R.,‚Ä¢ Centretech,22 Mar,"Same as downtown a lot of trash all over, the city looks dirty ‚òπÔ∏è"
8,180883098,Darin Wentz,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,23 Mar,Those people are pigs and that's how they live even if there was a trash can they would still continue to throw that stuff on the ground where they sleep the city should run them out of there there are hypodermic needles all over the ground in that location those people are not concerned with the children or the people of this community and in my opinion any money spent to help them would be a waste they need to help themselves before we can help them
9,180883098,Kay Dragon,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,7w,"I agree, Darin Wentz it is a mess and they need to find someplace else to put these people. As long as people keep giving them money there, they will stay. I feel compassion for anyone out on the streets but these folks don't care. I couldn't go to the town council meeting but I am sure they have been approached with this problem and don't do anything to improve it. Off the subject but  BTW.. here is a PSA Darin did a great job cutting down some trees for me this summer. I will probably have more for you to do(edited)"
10,180883098,Nancy Brigham,‚Ä¢ Chambers Heights,23 Mar,The trash cans would probably be used to start fires to keep them warm.  I was at the light the other night and saw a man using one of the cones to put over a fire.  The heat went through the top to warm his hands.  I don't care about how they have ended up homeless.  I care about how they will get moved.  I moved out of the hood near down town Denver.  And now it's become the Slums of Aurora.  I wish I had some empty land that I could allow them to live on.
11,180883098,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Mar,Our mayor got in by 8 votes and he's useless. He knows about this issue but he does not care. He turns both blind eyes.
0,183319453,Florence Sebern,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,13 Apr,"I have no objection to Urban Peak. According to a report last week, the City currently spends $500,000,000 (that's a half billion) on homelessness. One might wonder:"
1,183319453,Jeffrey Sturman,‚Ä¢ City Park West,13 Apr,Over what time period? I think the city budget is $2 billion a year. I also wonder what portion of the above is federal or donated dollars.
2,183319453,Paige Burkeholder,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park East,20 Apr,"Jeffrey Sturman I think that article referenced City money (which some maybe Federal). Either of those are monies we put in with our hard earned dollars through taxes.  It seems that our City Council has determined they know what is best for us...and they have seemed to have forgotten that ‚Äúwe, the Denver residents‚Äù are THE CUSTOMER!  (As it is our money!)"
3,183319453,Ola Zak,‚Ä¢ University Park,3w,"Urban Peak budget as stated above is $7.5 million annually for 30 minors. That is $250,000/ minor! It seems strange to call someone 24 years old a minor. That minor can  already vote and fight in a war for last 6 years. We definitely have to protect the real minors.(edited)"
4,183319453,Jeffrey Sturman,‚Ä¢ City Park West,14 Apr,That's just one building. There are three apartment buildings and one shelter. It says they assist 1000 people a year.
5,183319453,Topher E.,‚Ä¢ Yosemite-Cherry Creek Townhomes,14 Apr,"The ""30 minors"" is in only one of the shelters.  They also have other facilities and programs."
0,181617442,Sophia Ramos,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,6w,This has been a business that has been around LONG before you moved here and decided to bring your notions of what is and is not ‚Äúdetrimental‚Äù to the area. What could help in this situation is thinking about displacing your concern into helping homeless populations and finding a middle ground with local businesses.(edited)
1,181617442,Christopher Belila,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,"Sophia...that's a fair point.  I don't have a right to define nice; but as a community don't we get to ask if a business is helping the community.  I'm voicing my opinion, which is nothing more than an opinion.  My concern is that public safety, and homeless community, has been an ongoing issue.  Crystal Murrillo (City Council Rep for our Ward I) has been very vocal about it.  If there are elements of the business community that contribute to the safety issue it's fair to talk about them.  If the community and the city say it's not an issue then I can except it.  "
2,181617442,Sophia Ramos,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,6w,"I appreciate your concern as well. It‚Äôs nice to see people actively trying to make our neighborhood better, but it‚Äôs also important to remember that this business and area has been the only home some people know. It is unfair to deem something as unsuitable to our neighborhood when that is subjective and a forced act of displacement. "
3,181617442,Terri Mc,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,6w,Isn't the business owner responsible for cleaning and maintaining the property? I couldn't tell from the video if there were any trash cans nearby. That would definitely help with keeping it clean if they had somewhere to throw the empties.(edited)
4,181617442,Christopher Belila,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,"Terri....there is a trash can.  However, they don‚Äôt clean up very often.  Also, people throw bottles across the street so it‚Äôs not their responsibility."
5,181617442,Randy Peal,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,6w,"I drive past this place on the weekends & it‚Äôs full of either homeless & a very bad element, people sitting or laying around it all day long. If you see strip clubs & porn stores as a bad element what about liquor stores like this one? great strides has been taken to clean up Colfax & places like this one will set that back. I agree that homelessness is a problem & this liquor store is only compounding that problem, it is not an asset to our community.(edited)"
6,181617442,Cassandra Martinez,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,28 Mar,In conversation-there in the last 4 years the homeless population had grown due to a few of the non profit agencies and low income housing around the two blocks or so. From 2010-2020 there was a charter school used to be 15th Elmira where many of area kids used to attend as well as I personally volunteered and worked there for 2 years before Aurora district removed the charter school. Anyhow the from 2010-2016 it was students of all grades. 2016-2018 was high school students and 2018-2020 it was elementary /middle school only. While working there the homeless population had increased and started to create some problems. We tried to help by offering them the food that we would toss out to them. It created an few issues where they would trash the area even though there were trash cans around. We have used clean up for discipline purposes and then just regular community services for our students to learn community skills. It started to become unsafe offering them food. There would be homeless coming to our school looking for the food we were tossing. Or wait at the doors trying to come in. We had to cease donating warm meals to those in need for safety of our staff and students.üò≠
7,181617442,Christopher Belila,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,To everyone making a comment my video was to start a discussion.  If there are good solutions let‚Äôs hear them. I don‚Äôt have them.  I want us to talk and be active in our community.  The lack of activity has contributed to the area to be in decline.
8,181617442,Terri Mc,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,28 Mar,Maybe contact the city to see if they will do anything? I wonder if enough people complained they might do something about it.
9,181617442,Christopher Belila,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,Good idea.  We should all call and at least make an effort
10,181617442,Cassandra Martinez,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,28 Mar,I just want to say that this is a touchy subject that can turn argumentatively but I just want to share my opinion from experiences! I hope you can find a better solution and collaborate with those in the business as well as those who are the customers of that business!
11,181617442,Christopher Belila,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,"Cassandra, you makes some very good points.  I have no desire to separate the community.  The Arts District is a wonderfully diverse community, and it's one that I want to see thrive.  I don't want the area to be turned into Rino or 5 Points.  "
12,181617442,Cassandra Martinez,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,28 Mar,You are right! It should be safer for everyone. In reality I have been concern for over a decade and for the first time in over 8 years I can breath a bit with some of the clean up with the art work on the buildings as well as many new businesses and community centers around.
13,181617442,Christopher Belila,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,"To all those that are observing this conversation Cassandra and I are engaging in very thoughtful conversation.  This is the type of dialogue that helps a community.  This is how ideas start and change happens.  I thank Cassandra for being vocal and point out things I, or others might not consider.  "
14,181617442,Cathlene Santos,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,28 Mar,"You know Christopher, the police have a video that I gave them a couple of years ago. My husband and I went to buy a bottle of wine and I had recorded several people jumping a female and male and while waiting for police I recorded what violence goes on around there. A guy was just about to stab someone just when the police arrived. That was actually the last time I went to buy liquor there. Most of the people hanging around out there aren‚Äôt even homeless it‚Äôs become a place to panhandle people for liquor money. I‚Äôve tried to get business and city to Inforcement no loitering and trespassing."

6,186067393,Heather Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 days ago,"I‚Äôm afraid to ask, did something happen that prompted this post? With all the dog adoptions recently I have witnessed some terrible punitive ‚Äútraining‚Äù. When I‚Äôve offered any suggestions I was verbally attacked and worried they will then take out further frustrations on the dog. I have it all on video however it‚Äôs not enough that would be considered ‚Äúabuse‚Äù legally. It‚Äôs really awful to watch üòï"
7,186067393,Jessica Busby,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,2 days ago,"Yes, Heather I'm trying to help with education and resources. I think giving people under a ton of stress the benefit of the doubt may not only help the family but also help the animals. Since so many are homeless and put down. This is only if you can closely monitor the situation. Of course if a pet is known to be in immediate danger than you need to act quickly. I hope I'm doing the right thing. It's been keeping me awake at night with worry."
8,186067393,Samantha Robles,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,4 days ago,So sad Heather. I pray for harsher punishment for animal abusers

5,179892143,Janelle Miller,‚Ä¢ Aurora,14 Mar,I just got a package in the mail just yesterday (which is a little late now) but contains a bunch of those heat packs for your hands- I would love to donate a bunch to the homeless if you‚Äôre out and about the next snowfall perhaps...
6,179892143,Heather MacPhail,‚Ä¢ Montbello,16 Mar,Hand them out when your out. On most corners
7,179892143,John Hand,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Mar,SURE!!!!! Just shoot me a call and so we can figure out pickup details.....720-985-6949.

0,178135964,Kim Dechant,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Feb,"Please return the cat you took!  Aside from being a criminal act, it is heartbreaking for the owner."
1,178135964,Kathy Davinci,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,24 Feb,"It's technically a criminal act in Aurora to let your cat roam free. Not that APD actually enforces any laws in this neighborhood, but it is illegal to let your cats, and of course dogs, outside. This story doesn't make sense. They caught her trying to steal their cat, and they still left it outside? You can't even leave a bag of trash outside in this neighborhood without it being stolen, so why would anyone leave a family member, which is what a pet is, outside at the mercy of all the bad things that could happen to a defenseless animal? This defies common sense to the point that I'm not convinced it's real."
2,178135964,Diocoles Fillenworth,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,23 Feb,"That woman has a mental issue to do that. It's one thing if the cat is homeless or in a blizzard and needs protection, but that's just crazy."
3,178135964,shannon quillian,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,23 Feb,Horrible. Oh I pray this women returns her cat
4,178135964,Teresa Holmes,‚Ä¢ Locust St,23 Feb,Do you have proof that this lady stole a cat? This picture only shows a lady with a stange smile on her face.  Maybe a neighbors ring footage? Something
5,178135964,Chelsea Lavelle,‚Ä¢ Aurora,10w,The video does not show her stealing your cat. Keep your pets inside.(edited)
6,178135964,Teresa Holmes,‚Ä¢ Locust St,24 Feb,That's what I said.  I see a lady w a strange smile. That's it.
7,178135964,Laura M.,‚Ä¢ Lowry,24 Feb,"Many cats love to loaf around their front/back yards. They're territorial so they rarely venture more than a 2-3 house radius from home. This lady stopped in the middle of the street, leaving her driver's side door open. It looks to me like she was looking to make a quick getaway. Who stops in the middle of the road and leaves their car door open just so they can pet a neighborhood cat? The cat looks very friendly so he was most likely pretty relaxed (ie - near his home). I'm all for keeping your pets inside but sometimes they just get out. I wouldn't judge in this case. It seems to me that clearly the owner is distressed and the images make it look like the lady was going in to abduct the cat. Didn't the OP also say the same lady had come by once before saying something like ""that's my sister's cat""?"
8,178135964,Nathalie Landeau,‚Ä¢ Central Park,10w,My understanding is that this Woman came by twice. Allegedly the first time the owner stopped her and she left.  The second time she came over she allegedly took the cat.  The video might be of encounter #1(edited)
9,178135964,Craigers Hanzelka,‚Ä¢ Central Park,24 Feb,Why isn't the person who owns the cat not posting herself?
10,178135964,Nathalie Landeau,‚Ä¢ Central Park,10w,She posted on the next door app.  She is not a member of this FB group.  I am just trying to help her a bit.(edited)

0,176138781,Cassandra Martinez,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,13w,That‚Äôs a good idea but yet might have to think this through. Sometimes the idea to solve homeless seems to be easy yet the obstacles present prevents changes.

4,176138781,Meg Ticknor,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,6 Feb,"No, these are not a tenable long term shelter- a better idea is to have auctions for them, as a fundraiser for a nonprofit you choose to partner with- money could go further this way."
5,176138781,Jamie Bennett,‚Ä¢ Del Mar North,6 Feb,You are a go- getter. Align yourself with others of that ilk. You can go as far as you can dream. Dream big!!!
6,176138781,Jay Yoakam,‚Ä¢ Aurora,6 Feb,I want one if your plan is not working out. I will buy one. You might look into nonprofit land donations

8,176138781,Carolyn McDonald,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,6 Feb,You should contact Robin Kneisch on Denver City Council. She‚Äôs responsible for promoting new projects to benefit the city. Thanks for your help & hope this helps. It‚Äôs a huge need here.
9,176138781,Bonnie Stanfield,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,6 Feb,"You are awesome, thank you for thinking of the homeless.   Denver Community Church has turned its parking lot downtown into a tent city, they may have a need.   Also, Dry Bones, a non profit, works with the homeless youth, and they might be a great resource as well."

0,177528991,Jan Delsi,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,18 Feb,WOW!  that is all I can say.  That is a crazy crime.
1,177528991,Drew Rudolph,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,18 Feb,Unfortunately it seems to me we need to step up our personal security as a community. 
2,177528991,Stephanie Schilken,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Feb,We had to do the same. Our neighbors are all working together and upgrading to cover as much as possible as well. Crime is up significantly since covid.

4,177528991,Kara Vitek,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Feb,Roughly where are you located?
5,177528991,Nathan Slape,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Feb,On Clinton way near 28th
6,177528991,Cathlene Santos,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,18 Feb,I get of work at 3am and drive home on CentralPark blvd from 48th and Havana st. The lights are brighter on that street than they are on your side streets. I‚Äôve been trying to keep an eye for anything that might be suspicious. If I see anything I will dial 911. I live between your area and Lowery and we‚Äôre trying to get our street lights brighter. So sorry that this happened to you. Hopefully things get back to normal soon.
7,177528991,Bernadette Jackson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Feb,They stole my car right under the light
8,177528991,Aaron Alpert,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Feb,"Sorry to hear. Outside of parking in the garage, reporting light outages to Xcel or motion sensor lights, or having porch lights on, i'ts hard to prevent this."
9,177528991,Rosalyn Price,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,18 Feb,Not sure but a lot of homeless off Smith Rd. Using it as fuel to keep warm? Surely no one in neighborhood needing to steal gas. Omg how terrible !!
10,177528991,Nathan Slape,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Feb,"I should add the Nissan guy said I was lucky I didn‚Äôt catch on fire driving up to the gas station! Be careful, if you smell gas you might want to look under your car"
11,177528991,Marty Johnson,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,18 Feb,My car was broken into the other day and ransacked.  Nothing was taken as far as I could see but it still irked me a lot.  There has been a lot of these type of crimes happening all over the metro area but especially in our Northeastern neighborhoods.
12,177528991,Austin Outhavong,‚Ä¢ Bluff Lake Aurora,18 Feb,Gosh now this on top of the catalytic converter thefts. I didn‚Äôt realize garage real estate would be so valuable
13,177528991,Heather Mann,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Feb,Oh no!!!!  What creeps !!!!! Ugh I‚Äôm sorry. What part of Central Park are u in? Cross streets?
14,177528991,Nathan Slape,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Feb,28th and Clinton way
15,177528991,Ann Mathews,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,18 Feb,"People are stealing things that will help them to work- tools, trucks, plow blades, etc. They are desperate for work and money. It probably suggests the best way to get people re-employed. Give them the tools they need for self employment."
16,177528991,Don Schooley,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,18 Feb,Open the country. Stealing is no answer.
17,177528991,Cathlene Santos,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,18 Feb,"Please everyone be very careful outside everywhere you go!

18,177528991,Francine Qualls,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,18 Feb,"Thanks for the information,  and sorry you had to deal with this extra expense, which they could give a damn about"
19,177528991,Nathan Slape,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Feb,Thanks. It wouldn‚Äôt have been a big deal if they siphoned out every last drop but what kind of messed up people damage a car to a point it has to be towed for a couple of gallons of gas!?
20,177528991,Gloria BURNS,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,18 Feb,"I am so sorry you are right.we do need help what hurt is the extra money to pay for all the damage that other people cause.we are not alone this is happening all over, it don't fix the problem so we have to take all the problem that our neighbors are having and try to see how we can not be a victim,can we ask the police for suggestions?please be safe and take care  (peace)"
21,177528991,Dagny Taggert,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Feb,"Nathan, Be sure to report to the PD.  They apparently caught recently some who were stealing cars.  They provide more patrol when they have more reported incidents."
22,177528991,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,18 Feb,"Remember that woman who Gorilla-glued her hair to her head? I keep thinking with all the theft going on, too bad you can't coat your vehicle and its parts with Gorilla glue and let the thieves get stuck to it. Then they get to figure out a way to get unstuck before they get caught or get to spend the night stuck to the vehicle they're trying to steal or vandalize."
23,177528991,Alton Ghrist,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,18 Feb,"I found the gas tank inlet door open one morning when I went to work, and I'd figured someone had tried to siphon gas and left the scene suddenly. remember the locking gas caps from the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973?"
24,177528991,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,11w,OMG yes! Now they have interior releases so if the thief is outside the car it‚Äôs more difficult to open the door to access the gas filler cap. But those filler doors can be pried open or they can just cut the line. Whatever is done to thwart bad actors can be gotten around by them(edited)
25,177528991,Marcella Oliver,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,18 Feb,That is terrible! So sorry this happened to you! I've been a victim of vehicle theft but nothing as crazy as this.
26,177528991,Bernadette Jackson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,19 Feb,"this is crazy, what we need to do is form our own security. or hire a security company. those who want it can meet and discuss. like a town hall or something."
0,177668475,Catie McLane,‚Ä¢ Adams Heights,20 Feb,"laura,  Thank you for doing this. Are you only interested in mens? I keep meaning to clean out some stuff....Larger womens clothes and some mens. I can probably work on that this week....."
1,177668475,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,20 Feb,I can definitely use the large women's clothes for Sam House and just about all the men's stuff you have or can get.  Thanks a lot.

3,177668475,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,21 Feb,I would like to take the towels and clothes to the shelters after sorting them.  Let me know a good time to pick them up.  Thanks for thinking of the homeless.

5,177668475,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,21 Feb,But RC only has 49 cents in the world.
0,175643330,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,1 Feb,you‚Äôll find that a lot of the specious claims about this amendment are carefully addressed by the documents on the city website linked above
1,175643330,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,1 Feb,"Steve, Of course. It‚Äôs their ‚Äúsales brochure‚Äù.... And many valid and objective issues are very gray or not addressed at all."
2,175643330,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,1 Feb,what issues are not addressed at all?
3,175643330,Chris P.,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,1 Feb,Chapter 59 Exemptions are still barely being addressed. Pretty disappointed to see an amendment all about equity and fairness leave 20% of the city out.
4,175643330,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,1 Feb,"the Chapter 59 issue (properties still under the ""old"" zoning code) is far more complex than this and touched every other citywide zoning change for the past ten years; that Group Living is the issue that would light a fire under Chapter 59 doesn't make a lot of sense"
5,175643330,Chris Metzger,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,14w,For the rest of the story:
6,175643330,Matt Fritz-Mauer,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,2 Feb,"The Safe and Sound group has been the worst aspect of all of this. Their ""Meet Your New Neighbors"" propaganda video was just disgusting, a grotesque misrepresentation of every aspect of this. "
7,175643330,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,1 Feb,"here's today's Denver Post editorial in support of the amendment; it's a good, brief summary of the issues:"
8,175643330,Paige Burkeholder,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park East,1 Feb,And here is a very thorough discussion by the Denver Gazette that has been following this story much more closely:  https://denvergazette.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-group-living-all-harm-no-good/article_bd6ea004-5c68-11eb-81f7-dbc3cc08a6af.html
9,175643330,Carolyn Haas,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,1 Feb,If this amendment and it‚Äôs effect were so well addressed that why did a citizen have to go through the courts to get 48 public documents about this amendment? Just saying this mayor and the city Council don‚Äôt always have your best interest in mind. My personal opinion.
10,175643330,KR C.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,1 Feb,Thank you and agreed.  They don‚Äôt have the public‚Äôs best interest in mind on this one.  They did go through the courts and documents and information was hidden from the public. Check safeandsounddenver.com
11,175643330,Matt C.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,14w,"There are essentially two major concerns of the opposition. Fear of other people, and a desire to maintain property values. Neither is a good look ""politically"" speaking, so they have to launder their position so as not to look selfish or discriminatory. "
12,175643330,Matt C.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,2 Feb,"Tonia Wilson Ah yes, the ""I know you are, but what am I"" defense. Conjecture does not = facts, and nothing of any substance has been ""uncovered""."
13,175643330,Teresa G.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,1 Feb,"I am most grateful to the extensive research conducted, and advocacy offered, by members of the Safe and Sound group, as well as to members of various RNOs, a few Denver City Council members, thousands of Denver residents, and other stakeholders for expressing opposition to the original Group Living text amendments. Without the research, advocacy, and voiced opposition, the Group Living text amendments would not have undergone revisions in December 2020 that make them a bit more reasonable in their current form. Regardless of how one perceives the tone of the Safe and Sound site, and regardless of how one considers the Group Living text amendments in their current and revised form, the long-term  effects of the proposed text amendments remain to be seen on the increase of housing availability while decreasing housing costs, decreasing gentrification, minimizing neighborhood density, and creating equity in the availability of resources across all parts of the City and County of Denver."

20,175643330,Paul B.,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill Central,3 Feb,I don't understand your claim. 
21,175643330,Paige Burkeholder,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park East,14w,"Matt Cordon Chapter 59 was not disclosed by the City or CPD; 311 and pocket gov photos submitted by residents were not able to be viewed by inspectors was recently uncovered by people in SSD (and is now maybe fixed by CPD); the many special interests and limited # of residents w/ lack of diversity on GLAC was further disclosed by Denver neighbors; that this is a housing issue not a race issue; the list of hundreds of violations in NE Denver that cant seem to ever get resolved leading to lack of confidence in ZNIS with these proposed zoning changes; the significant number of police calls/cars to CC facilities and a youth rehabilitation/detention center....just to name a few.  Many Denver neighbors across the city, all of different ages, backgrounds, ethnicities, income and political affiliations worked across the City to bring specific and detailed information out about this massive zoning code change.  Because the City didn‚Äôt. There should have been more public discussion on this...which is hard to do due to limitations in gatherings during a pandemic. And yes, it should have been on the ballot.(edited)"
22,175643330,Luchia B.,‚Ä¢ Baker,2 Feb,"The Baker Historic Neighborhood Association, a Denver RNO, fully supports the GLA. In fact, it's a shame it was watered down so much."
23,175643330,Paige Burkeholder,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park East,2 Feb,Here is a list of neighbors that oppose the GLA.
24,175643330,Michelle B.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,2 Feb,"Honest question for those that know: It occurred to me that our wealthiest neighborhoods probably aren't at any risk of being over-run by group homes as the cost to rent these homes would still be astronomical given the amount that would have to be paid.  I also find it hard to believe that a proprietor of group-living homes would look there first for the same reason.  Those homes are just too expensive to reasonably locate a group-home/transitional home in them.  Has this proven true in the cities that have enacted this type of rule?  So, really, this falls to the middle class and poorer neighborhoods to absorb this .... as they do for everything else.  In principal, I'm in favor of this.  Allowing 4 unrelated adults to split a 3 or 4 bedroom home makes so much sense in this housing market. And, if they can afford it - who are we to say they can't?  But, I'm not a fan of pushing this through without addressing the Chapter 59 issue (it defies any attempt to be equitable).  That makes the whole thing sketchy in my opinion."
25,175643330,Teresa G.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,2 Feb,"Hi, Michelle, Excellent observation and point! This is exactly what Pam Jiner, according to Luchia B.‚Äôs post, my ‚Äúone black friend,‚Äù referenced in this article:"
26,175643330,Barbara Lencicki,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,2 Feb,"Exactly. The Chapter 59 conundrum- the 20 % of the city which will not be affected by any of this, those two districts are not even in the wealthiest parts of the city .  Mayor Hancock, coincidentally, happens to live in one of them!"
27,175643330,Florence Sebern,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,2 Feb,"Link to the court docs regarding the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) request to the Mayor's office that was denied, challenged, and WON. 97% of the denied documents were court ordered to be released. This Amendment was cooked up by the Mayor, two at-large councilpersons, and providers of services. The hidden objectives were 1) increase community corrections, 2) increase homeless shelters, 3) increase density in single family neighborhoods because of the City's failed efforts with community corrections-homeless shelters-affordable housing. This is a direct transfer of those failures to hard-working, tax-paying, stable Denverites."
28,175643330,Matt C.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,2 Feb,One of your spokespeople told me to ask you if you're going to file a follow up lawsuit with all the  evidence of impropriety and dirty dealings your first suit uprooted?

I can also leave the holographic puzzle we were too blind to do and hope you have an easier one to trade for a while.  I'm sorry I won't be here in the morning due to the laundry, but if you come by before 1:00 or between 3:30 and 5:00, I won't be on a phone bank or watching the release of Pres. Obama's new book.

1,181171793,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Mar,I found my last car on Denver Craigslist and I highly recommend spending $125 to have Automotive MDs look it over. They do a 120-point check of the vehicle so you don‚Äôt buy yourself any nasty surprises. They‚Äôve checked my last 3 purchases and I‚Äôve never had a single issue that I didn‚Äôt know about when I bought the vehicle.

25,181171793,Arthur Louis,‚Ä¢ South Hilltop,26 Mar,Colin. With the pandemic used cars are at a premium and new cars are sitting on the dealers lots. Most car buyers do not want to or can't afford to buy a new car. Best of luck and remember buyer beware

0,172797351,Randy Dust,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Jan,How weird that she would return to the same spot again!
1,172797351,Lynn Stubbart,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 Jan,Anyone check the back?  Traffickers?  Just thinking out loud...
2,172797351,Lisa Cherry,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Jan,There is a lock on the back
3,172797351,Richard Caldwell,‚Ä¢ Central Park,5 Jan,Homeless camping?  I have seen some other vehicles around CP parked for weeks
4,172797351,Kelly Petersen,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,18w,"What I feel is very strange about the situation somebody with a warrant is not going to bail out of jail in 30 minutes there's a reason for the warrant that needs to be squished before they let people go as far as my education tells me. And the cops dropped her off, very unusual maybe she's a confidential informant possibly keeping an eye on somebody in your neighborhood that could potentially be a bigger worry.(edited)"
5,172797351,Kelly Petersen,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,18w,"Other than that she's probably just homeless lives in her truck and doesn't have a better part of town to park at the moment, or possibly out of fuel those big box trucks guzzle gasoline. I would think people that are thieves or criminals would not stay in one spot where they can be seen by the same people over and over again. Hard telling not knowing, though I have to agree with you, after the cops it is a rather odd situation.(edited)"

7,172797351,Jennifer W.,‚Ä¢ Central Park,5 Jan,We have someone parking in front of our house every afternoon through the following morning in Northfield. He keeps his car on all night.
8,172797351,Mark Groves,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17w,"That same truck was parked in front of my house over Christmas, just after the incident in Tennessee. I notified 311 and I  watched police make contact with them. There are 2 people, one of them likes to yell out loud from time to time. "
9,172797351,Lisa Cherry,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Jan,"Thank you for sharing this information. It is slightly comforting to know that we aren‚Äôt alone. The woman yells often, using profanity and aggression. She seems very unstable. The police also informed us about the 72 hour rule, which leaves me feeling powerless over the situation, as they move every two days."
10,172797351,Karla Alva,‚Ä¢ Hale,5 Jan,I feel your frustration and I also feel bad for her. If I were you I would march right up to that passenger door and insist she tell me what the hell was going on with her üòÖ
11,172797351,Karla Alva,‚Ä¢ Hale,5 Jan,"...On her hands, Literally. I had to pull this photo from google photos - but this is what the hands of a meth addict will look like. I know of this because I have a close family member with a meth addiction. They too hang out in their car for hours and hours and even live out of it sometimes months on end. Unfortunately it‚Äôs the life many drug addicts like and choose over sobriety and a warm home. Best of luck to you guys with this situation üôè‚ú®"
12,172797351,Lisa Cherry,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Jan,Thank you for the information. I appreciate you taking the time to share your perspective.
13,172797351,Karla Alva,‚Ä¢ Hale,5 Jan,In the meantime- I would go out and get a wind chime and/or a multi faceted crystal that you can hang in their general direction to block the negative chi you are experiencing coming from their direction. I would hang the wind chimes or bells from the cable dish or anywhere outside the sound won‚Äôt be obstructed- and far enough from your bedroom windows. Then I would hang the crystal in the window on the inside of  home. Simple Feng Shui at your service!
14,172797351,Chad Angell,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Jan,Since you are the one who called the cops can‚Äôt you call them and ask what they did or are doing about the warrant? And why they let her stay there? Just curious
15,172797351,Lisa Cherry,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 Jan,"I called back and the information they provided was that they investigated the situation, she wasn‚Äôt a threat, and that I could not take further action until they were outside for more than 72 hours"

17,172797351,Julie Lovell,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 Jan,Hard times for many folks and people are forced to live in their vehicles. Be kind but cautious. Could easily be any of us.
18,172797351,Aldo Covarrubias,‚Ä¢ Clayton,7 Jan,"that may be her home and she may be mentally ill, and maybe addicted to a substance to numb the pain of existing. Not everyone has the same luck as those who have a ""normal life""."
19,172797351,Gretchen Koehler,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,17w,"That is kind of obvious.  It doesn't mean that we have to accept homeless people who ""may be mentally ill"" possibly leaving needles, excrement or bothering people who live in a nice neighborhood.  Seriously,  what if the issue becomes so great that we have homeless people living in cars up and down neighborhood blocks.  Are you going to say we should just accept it because poor them?  I have helped the homeless on many occasions.  Believe me some of them want help.  Many do not.  They understand how to live on the streets and they are truly comfortable with the lifestyle.   The drug addicts just want their next ""fix"" and will do whatever it takes to get it.  Lisa good luck in helping the woman move along.  For any of you that are concerned about the woman's welfare, don't insult Lisa by patronizing her.  Here's an idea, go find the box truck and offer her a ride to the methadone clinic or to get registered with Denver Health and Human Services.  There is a place right on Colfax just east of Colorado on the Northside of the street that you can take her to get some help.(edited)"
0,172187656,Beth Spohn,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,30 Dec,Thanks for considering donating!  From park hill Facebook page:  Montview Presbyterian Church has a Mitten Tree and Coat Drive every year for new and gently used items. Kids coats and warm items will go to Hallett Academy in Park Hill; adult items will go to programs for men and women experiencing homelessness. Due to Covid the drop off bin has been moved to my porch at 4935 Montview Blvd nw corner at Elm. Thanks in advance for your donations. We‚Äôll be collecting through the month of December.
1,172187656,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,2 Jan,"Will you be giving some away for the homeless now that is  New Years?  If so, Resurrection Clothing goes directly to the homeless camps several times a week with clothing, etc.  We can really use them right now..."
0,177828795,Susan Blake,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,20 Feb,"Call and they will bring you new ones. Weirdly this happens all the time. Sometimes it‚Äôs just the wind. Others, who knows"
1,177828795,Kathleen Rule,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,21 Feb,Call 311 like Susan says. We had our recycling bin fall into the truck two weeks ago! I coincidentally was looking out when it happened. 311 brought us a new bin very quickly.
2,177828795,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,21 Feb,"Hi Riley. Look around the alleys near you. The ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù in the area will frequently take the rollaway bins as rolling storage to move stuff. We regularly find bins in our back alley with numbers that don‚Äôt match our street and post on ND, call the city."
0,172514153,Gina DeMeo,‚Ä¢ Skyland,2 Jan,"Laura, my husband just cleaned out his closet and we have a coat, sweaters/sweatshirts, sweatpants, socks etc we can donate.  If you‚Äôre interested lmk where I can drop everything."

3,172514153,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,2 Jan,"How do you mean help?  Do you have some donations to offer?  I live in NE Park  Hill too so maybe I could pick up anything you have on Monday (Sunday is going to suck already).  If you have things to drop off, I live at 3556 Fairfax St. near ML King and Elm.  If we are out, you could leave things on the glass table on the porch.  thanks a lot.  We are totally dependent on the goodwill of people like you."

5,172514153,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,2 Jan,"You can drop off at 3556 Fairfax St. just off M L King and elm.  If we are out, you could leave them on the glass table on the front porch.  "
6,172514153,Brandee Hommerding,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 Jan,I have a jacket or 2 that I can donate
7,172514153,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,2 Jan,Good deal.  Where are you?  I live in NE Park Hill where the rents are right (and if you want to keep them down you just have to fire off a couple of shots in the night).  I will be driving around on Monday to pick things up if you can give me your address or I will love you forever if you can bring them to my house at 3556 Fairfax St. off M L King and Elm.  Just leave them on the glass table.  Our anti-Trump signs keep the porch pirates away.  Let me know what you would like to do.  And thanks a lot.
8,172514153,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,4 Jan,"Did you find me on Sunday?  Some people came and went and I never knew who they were.  The certainly brought some  warm and nice things.  If you were one of them, I thank you.  They will go out either Tuesday or Saturday."

I live in NE Park Hill  and could come up to Aurora on Monday if you will send me your address...My manager, Monalisa, said people were crying last week when she gave out coats they were so relieved to get warm.  They will love them.  Thank you for your generosity."

15,172514153,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,7 Jan,"Yes, we have no blankets right now.  They are definitely needed.  Also men's clothes.  I have a few but need more to help even one camp.  I will take anything that is intact and clean.  If dirty, I wash and dry.  If torn up, I discard.  We will be going downtown on Saturday morning if you can get it by my place by then.  My address is 3556 Fairfax just of 35th and Elm.  You can pick it out by the Trump signs.  Thank you very much!"
16,172514153,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,4 Jan,"I bet you sneaked up to the porch and left some nice warm clothes, right?  Several people came and went.  I am so heartened at all the fine clothing, sleeping bags, etc. I have received.  It makes me happy just knowing my manager will have them to take to the camps.  thank you again."
17,172514153,Janassa Opichka,‚Ä¢ Beeler Park,5 Jan,Are you accepting children‚Äôs coats?
18,172514153,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,6 Jan,"Yes, we are.  Even though children don't live on the streets, we have a need for children's clothes and toys for a low-income housing complex where my manager lives.  There are a lot of families affected by COVID who can't afford to buy what they need or want.  They pick things up from her and leave donations in her ""love box"" in return.  We did give gifts to homeless parents who might see their kids over the holidays so they would have a gift to give and to homeless kids outside Urban Peak.  I just sent a box and 2 bags of clothes and 3 bags of toys home with her to share today.    We will go to the homeless camps this weekend so I can give her more and the big  suitcases and packs then.  Are you able to come to 3556 Fairfax St.?  I have been ordered to stay sitting or lying down for two more days.   I will love you forever if you can..."

20,172514153,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,7 Jan,Did I pick them up on Monday or do you have more?   I guess from the date of the post that you have more.  What is your address again?  I tossed my note.
21,172514153,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,10 Jan,I am ready to go out now if you can give me your address.   I would love the coats to give to low-income kids in Section 8 housing.

It is demoralizing for anyone, especially teens, to feel dirty and have to wear dirty clothes.  How wonderful it would be if the schools provided washers and dryers and a small shower stall to help these kids who are poor and/or homeless through absolutely no fault of their own.  This show of caring might help to keep students on the edge in school."

0,180006053,Daniel Webb,‚Ä¢ Lowry,14 Mar,"Any reason you think your house would‚Äôve been targeted twice?   I always wonder how they ‚Äúpick‚Äù, or if it‚Äôs just totally random"
1,180006053,Lisa Haldeman,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,14 Mar,No clue. I know there have been 2 cars stolen within blocks of our house (one on the other side of the school and one on 11th) as well as other auto break-ins.  Maybe we‚Äôre a good target because there is a school across the street so we only have two direct neighbors/potential witnesses??
2,180006053,Jan Beck,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,14 Mar,"Lisa Haldeman Lisa very valid. Really sorry that this has happened to you, I live a few blocks away from you."
3,180006053,Kathy Sudmeier,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,14 Mar,Sorry to hear that.   Makes no sense.  I don‚Äôt think anyone keeps valuables in a glove box.   Hopefully they are not looking for registrations and proof of insurance with identifying information.  Or I have heard they are seeking garage door openers to access garage .   I leave nothing but an owners manual and an old fashioned map of  Colorado!

1,171920201,Linder Gendron,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,28 Dec,I may have a few coats! One needs a bit of repair in the pocket but still a good warm coat. Please let me know if it can be used.
2,171920201,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,30 Dec,"I now have the phone number for Rick  Roberts at Harvest Christian Church  He has all the coats to give.  Call him at 303-815-4914 and tell him of your need.  He knows I want more, so I'll probably call him tomorrow.  And here is some info about Resurrection Clothing.  "
3,171920201,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,2 Jan,"I bet we could give the mattress pad away to someone who is sleeping on the ground.  The coats are definitely needed.   I am with Resurrection Clothing (see above post).  We may get some tomorrow but not many and I'm waiting for Coats for Colorado to process my application.  Meanwhile, there are thousands of homeless people out there from climates that don't prepare them for a long cold winter.  May we have them?  Message me and I'll arrange to pick them up.  Thank you!"

I applied in November and I would call them at least once a week abs they let me know what was going on. I just finally got approved. Also keep in contact with excel, let them know give applied for leap and they will work with you. But someone said you have to apply for leap first before other resources will help. Hope you find out something soon."

3,174707662,Lina Reznicek-Parrado,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Jan,So sorry!! Were they inside of your property?
4,174707662,Aszur Rollins,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Jan,"They used the garage door opener to get in the garage to steal our bikes. Other than that no, they stayed in the alley"

7,174707662,Kay Kriz,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Jan,"Please be aware, I observed a white four-door Hyundai with no plates or temporary tags circling the neighborhood around 415 this afternoon. I suspect they are linked to the car/bike theft."
8,174707662,Aszur Rollins,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Jan,This was them.
9,174707662,Barbara Mattison,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,23 Jan,That is the white car we saw.  Hispanic man in the car and a rather attractive women pushing the bike.

11,174707662,David Petersen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,23 Jan,"Yep, saw her in the same white car today around 3pm on Severn. She acted suspiciously, driving very slow looking at garages. Sorry that this happened to you."
12,174707662,Brian Stalemo,‚Ä¢ Lowry,15w,Sorry to hear this. I've had many bikes stolen over the years. Nowadays I use a U-lock for the back and cable for the front tire and frame. I hope you find it(edited)
13,174707662,Kristin Callahan,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,23 Jan,Uff! So sorry!
14,174707662,Barbara Mattison,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,23 Jan,"A little after1pm we were walking on Niagara coming up to 11th and we saw a women walking the single speed with aqua wheels.  We commented pn the beautiful wheels but she did not respond.  A man pulled up in a white Hyundai Tucson and I think they were planning to load your bike into the car but we did not stare at them.  So Sorry.  We should have gotten a plate # or a photo but it was only after a half a minute that we realized the whole scene was fishy.  Having been victim of a theft a few months ago and understanding as cyclists how those bikes were very meaningful, we are truly sorry.  Are you in the house with a newer Mustang in the driveway facing Montclair School?  If so, the garage door had been opened and was open as we walked through the alley."
15,174707662,Aszur Rollins,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Jan,"That is our house yes, unfortunately that was my bike with the pretty wheels"
16,174707662,Moises Valdez,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Jan,My suburban was stolen as well it had a plow on it I got lucky enough to catch them a few days later while trying to remove the rims but lost about $7000.00 in tools including the plow 
17,174707662,Moises Valdez,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Jan,This is my work truck
18,174707662,Erik Peterson,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,23 Jan,So sorry to hear that.  Will keep an eye out.
19,174707662,Jerry Hashi,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Jan,Sorry this happened. Will keep an eye out too.
20,174707662,Kari Rutter,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Jan,"Hit the pawn shops, that happened to us and within 2 hours we got a call that our bike showed up.  It was a mess but worth it to get it back."
21,174707662,Aszur Rollins,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,24 Jan,"Great idea, thanks"
22,174707662,Nancy DuPree,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,24 Jan,I am so sorry this happened to you both. Hope you can recoup your things. Glad you both were not hurt physically.
23,174707662,Lisa Haldeman,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,24 Jan,"So sorry to hear this happened to you. We live on the other side of the school, but were watching football so we didn't  see anything. Thanks for letting all of us know to be on alert."
24,174707662,Nikki Shears,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,25 Jan,SO very sorry!  Will keep eyes peeled.
25,174707662,Walker Dimmig,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,25 Jan,Same car involved in another incident in the neighborhood this morning: https://nextdoor.com/news_feed/?post=174868982
26,174707662,Norman Wilson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,28 Jan,Your bike may also be in one of the homeless camps downtown. One guy bought his bike back from a bike thief at a camp downtown. Be careful. See Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman's experience recently in the Post.
27,174707662,Aszur Rollins,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,5 Feb,They found our vehicle. I don‚Äôt have any particulars but it‚Äôs with the Denver police getting printed. Hopefully we get something from that
0,178677668,Daniel Webb,‚Ä¢ Lowry,1 Mar,"I‚Äôm with you.   We should try to organize this so that we have coverage without 2 or 3 people having to give up their nights.   It really shouldn‚Äôt be hard to catch these guys, and my feeling is that it‚Äôs not a ton of people doing it"
1,178677668,Krys Rodgers,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,Be careful...
2,178677668,Daniel Webb,‚Ä¢ Lowry,1 Mar,"At some point, and this has been true throughout history, people have to take on some risk to get things ‚Äúas they should be‚Äù.   This is wayyyy beyond out of control and no one is going to help us.   "
3,178677668,Brown Keener,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,Daniel Webb I agree. These punks don‚Äôt want confrontation. If they see someone standing there every corner they turn they‚Äôll eventually figure out they better go somewhere else.
4,178677668,William Davis jr,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,I'm in! Me and my Pitbull (gracy) happen to enjoy late night walks. I'm unemployed rite now and I'm a night owl. With all the shootings lately we haven't been going on walks around here but that can change. I'd love to help anyway I can. My truck had 17 gallons of gas siphoned from it. Me being unemployed that really put a damper in my day when I left to go to the store to get food and couldn't because I had no gas to do it. I too am at my wits end dealing with these thugs! gauranteed
5,178677668,Nathan Slape,‚Ä¢ Central Park,2 Mar,Be thankful they only siphoned the gas. Some fool actually cut the large fuel line going into my gas tank. It cost me 419.00 for them to get 5.00 worth of gas
6,178677668,Cathlene Santos,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,"We did just that on my block and several of us walked to both corners, and there is not just 1 person outside hanging around. I suggest something loud like those air horn‚Äôs. You know the one‚Äôs in the cans, you could hear them pretty far, and it also helps to make a map of the houses on both sides of your street and both sides of your alley and share phone numbers of the neighbors that want to contact or be contacted if needed to let them know about unwanted people on their properties. The horn would scare the hell out of them and wake people. Especially if you‚Äôre not far from Colfax"
7,178677668,Daniel Webb,‚Ä¢ Lowry,1 Mar,Great idea
8,178677668,William Davis jr,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,I'll make it a point to walk gracy later today. I'll give a heads up on here before I do. If you see us give a wave and I'll do the same. Cops aren't looking out for us so we have to do it for ourselves. Hope everyone has a safe day.
9,178677668,Brown Keener,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,"Thank you sir, you have a great day too!"
10,178677668,Brown Keener,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,I love the air horn idea. That will get everyone‚Äôs attention. Great deterrent!
11,178677668,Cathlene Santos,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,"I work graveyard and arrive home around 3am and I know all my neighbors car‚Äôs, and I wear a brace on one leg and I‚Äôm not able to run to my front door Incase someone is outside!"
12,178677668,Don Schooley,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,1 Mar,Longtime fellow sheepdog here. Always pay close attention. Relentlessly vigilant.
13,178677668,William Davis jr,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,That's me to a tee. Some people consider me peronoid. Call it what you want if there is something going on I'm gonna know it. My dog is a good judge if there is something out of place. She know good people and she know bad people and she knows the difference.
14,178677668,Karina Lopez,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,"Thank you Brown Keener and everyone else that is willing to be on the lookout. I have lived in this area for 20 years and am saddened by the increase in crime. This area did get cleaned up a few years back when all the new construction started happening, but that did not last. Covid and the homeless camps haven't helped. I am seriously considering moving üòî"
15,178677668,Don Schooley,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,1 Mar,Me too. I belong in a rural setting.
16,178677668,Veronica Barahona - Ziegler,‚Ä¢ Central Park,1 Mar,I get it but this idiots have guns. Do you want to risk your life? We worked hard for the things we worked for and it's unfair for an idiot to just come and take it. But is it worth your life?
17,178677668,Don Schooley,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,1 Mar,Yes. And yes. Sheepdogs are not helpless.
18,178677668,Veronica Barahona - Ziegler,‚Ä¢ Central Park,1 Mar,I don't think it's about being helpless. It's about what is more important your family or your material things.
19,178677668,Brown Keener,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,"I‚Äôm trained and still train, martial arts and weapons. I‚Äôm not looking for a fight, but Lord help anyone who attacks me. I won‚Äôt be bullied or stand by and watch, sorry it‚Äôs just not in my nature."
20,178677668,Don Schooley,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,1 Mar,Maybe they'll catch on.
21,178677668,Rocki Rosenbach,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,1 Mar,Please be careful they may have a gun :(
22,178677668,Don Schooley,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,10w,"So? Oh, you're talking to the criminals. I agree. Yes, criminals, be careful. They may have a gun.(edited)"
23,178677668,Rocki Rosenbach,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,1 Mar,JUST SAYING  !!!! Sorry
24,178677668,Don Schooley,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,1 Mar,Nothing to be sorry about. We don't want to shoot them. Their choice. Bad career path. They knew that when they signed up.
25,178677668,Patrick Mann,‚Ä¢ Central Park,1 Mar,I totally agree.  If we don‚Äôt stand up it will only get worse.  Much worse.
26,178677668,Kathy Davinci,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,RIGHT ON! üëçüèªüëèüèª
27,178677668,William Davis jr,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,Dash cams and ring doorbells are very useful tools as well. Amagine if every person on your block had a ring doorbell.
28,178677668,Mj Foster,‚Ä¢ Central Park,10w,"Most thieves don‚Äôt care if there face is seen, most burglaries never get solved, even with a face, they know this, burglaries that had a face where never solved as they are such low profile crimes, so cops don‚Äôt put out pictures of thieves, and because most are not registered in some system that already has their face, or even if they are cops use those systems to search for more important cases, if you get a picture of a crook, chances are it doesn‚Äôt matter because the cops can‚Äôt, or don‚Äôt have the time to match a name or an address to a face(edited)"
29,178677668,Don Harris,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,"Thank you very much, Brown Keener, for your concern and ""pro-activism!"" Please be careful and stay well."
30,178677668,Gloria BURNS,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,1 Mar,"I  do under stand how you feel before you do that is your life worth it? so why don't you come up with another plan it's to bad that radio shack is gone but you can get flood light at all four corners of your house, but you will have to get with the neighbors.i had a neighbor many years ago he had his house rig for this kind of problem.going from house to house and getting idea can also help please don't go out there at night you might not die but get hurt to the point where you can't do any thing for your self i hope you under stand what i am trying to say did you ask the police for suggestion? also what i got from consumer report if your yard look like no one care there is more of a chance of people breaking in maybe when we are free from covid we can figure something out.but please please don't go out i love you and i never met you.(peace)"
31,178677668,Don Harris,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,"Brown Keener, I concur with Gloria Burns. Please do not put your life at risk. Your family and friends value your life too much to have it put in jeopardy over this nonsense. Thanks again for caring and your willingness to bravely serve your community."
32,178677668,Mj Foster,‚Ä¢ Central Park,1 Mar,"You think they are all connected? How will word spread? Honestly just don‚Äôt keep stuff you don‚Äôt want stolen in places that are easy to get to, install a kill switch in your car if your worried about getting it stolen, costs like $30 and is easy to do, I can almost guarantee that the thieves are not all talking to each other, you won‚Äôt scare them away, just do stuff that makes you less of a target"
33,178677668,Terri Mcknight,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,1 Mar,Mj I think is right. Last fall I had a friend visiting. Her jeep was parked in my drive. My room mate was in his car in the drive. He was leaving. When all of a sudden her jeep is backing out of the driveway !!. We reviewed security footage. The beef pulled up on the side street you could see him walk in front of the vehicle that dropped him off you could see his shadow crossed in front of the car walked up the sidewalk to my driveway from the time he hit the vehicle till the time he was pulling out of my driveway it was 4 seconds 4 seconds that's so fast I was in shock. So anything to delay them or deter them make them have to stay around longer will most likely stop them.
34,178677668,Gloria BURNS,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,1 Mar,"I was just thinking the same thing Don we can do that or put on the car alarm if only at night the market for car alarm is out there let's search for something we all can afford and easy to install. i will try to look this week.I know together we can trim it down, let's do this (peace)"
0,170770370,Kate Green-Mularski,‚Ä¢ Locust St,14 Dec,My kids and I volunteer at the local food bank and collect items and make crochet hats for the homeless in our area and when we can make burritos on the weekends and deliver them to the homeless campers.

I haven't been able to get in contact with you, however.  Since I can only go out on Thursday and Friday due to a COVID test on Sat and double quarantining until surgery, could I ask if I could meet you somewhere to pick it up?  If you can call me at 303-316-6748 I will arrange something.  My colleague, Mona, will be going downtown on Friday evening to give out clothes, gifts, etc.  She is younger and more gutsy.  Thank you for your concern and generosity."

0,173030450,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,8 Jan,Everything in this documentary is against the law now so I am not sure what your point is. Anyone can live anywhere. Seems like you are trying to ease some guilt that might best be done in confession or some other personal place.
1,173030450,Gregory Clark,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,8 Jan,Harsh!
2,173030450,Gregory Clark,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,9 Jan,"Sorry, but just because something is against the law, Doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt occur. I think the article was good for awareness of things that not all of us experience."
3,173030450,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Jan,"I do believe that we should never forget and young people do need to learn what happened in the past lest we repeat it. It is, fortunately, not happening in Denver now."
4,173030450,Anna Noble,‚Ä¢ Central Park,9 Jan,"I disagree. Segregation is alive and well most everywhere. To assume that people are poor because they just aren‚Äôt working hard, or they made bad choices is the definition of white privilege.

0,168583651,Maria Draco,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,It's private property. It won't happen.  And as a resident who lives on the adjacent community - hell to the no.
1,168583651,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,Why? The property is huge. How does it affect you more than the people already roaming the area? To be clear / I am only 2 blocks from the entry.
2,168583651,Shawn Torres,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,No thanks we have enough to worry about. They should do brighton fields there
3,168583651,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,Which is what?
4,168583651,Shawn Torres,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,As far as crime and unwanted visitors on people's property there's enough around already. You can't say there will be zero crime associated with the move or area. Especially the middle of neighborhoods.
5,168583651,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,"Jill Christensen I have worked with the homeless in multiple cities. That is exactly why I suggest a secure area which can be monitored, humane and sanitary."
6,168583651,Nicole S.,‚Ä¢ Five Points North,23 Nov,Jill Christensen There are no services in Byers.
7,168583651,Kaila L.,‚Ä¢ Five Points,22 Nov,"How does this help find homeless jobs, homes & figure out a sustainable life?"
8,168583651,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,First - it helps keep them alive. Second - have you ever interviewed for a job without any address? The problems are much more complex than just just ‚Äúget a job‚Äù. Some cannot work without dealing with other issues first. Some are veterans with serious issues that prevent them from working. As for sustainability - if you are spending all your time just moving from place to place and trying to eat. You don‚Äôt have time to figure out how to build a life. Putting people in a secure place where they can access services is the first step.

10,168583651,Cristy Davis,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,23 Nov,"This is the program in the cap hill area, it‚Äôs called safe outdoor spaces.  Read about it!"
11,168583651,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,23 Nov,Cristy Davis thank you. That is exactly it.
12,168583651,Moises Alvelo,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Nov,ohhh this is going to be a good one!!!!
13,168583651,Karla Alva,‚Ä¢ Hale,23 Nov,I would invest into an apartment building complex for homelessness. One year free rent to get on your feet. Property paid for with tax dollars. Utilities paid for by occupant to also help build up their credit.
14,168583651,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,24 Nov,"The issue is - where would you locate it? The same people who fight a temporary encampment would fight harder to prevent permanent buildings. So you end up creating ‚Äúprojects‚Äù - something that has already proven to be a failure. I think the real solution is a version of PadSplit, which would be supported by the group housing ordinance currently under consideration (in its original form). Small groups or families scattered throughout communities where they are invested in the neighborhood and can support each other."
15,168583651,Marlissa Netzel,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Nov,There alot of field off of i70 or Smith Road
16,168583651,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,24 Nov,Yes - and it is close to Denver rescue mission. The value of the golf course is that the infrastructure is already there.
17,168583651,Zach Daniels,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,24 Nov,Yeah.... no
18,168583651,Quinton Feast,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,24 Nov,Why not?
19,168583651,Zach Daniels,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,24 Nov,"A. I think you should join me on the podcast because this is a great topic. B. Instead of using prisoners for slave labor wages we should take public jobs (cleaning up state parks etc) and use that for homeless so they have a job and can learn some skills/ eventually parse them out to private companies that may be able to pay more. ""Rent"" will.be deducted from pay and then won't be coming put of my tax dollars without any value add"
20,168583651,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,24 Nov,"That is an idea that has worked before. However, in order for it to work again we have to be willing to invest in those people, some of whom are honestly too damaged or too old to do the work you are suggesting. The investment must include room, board, and training, as it did before."
21,168583651,Daria M.,‚Ä¢ Sunnyside,29 Nov,"So what keeps homeless from committing a crime, going to jail, and having a dry place to sleep, 3 meals a day, and clothes to wear? I don‚Äôt see prison work as slavery, many enjoy being able to be productive and outside.  We always s have work to do in our city though so a program like you suggest would be wonderful!"
22,168583651,Joe B.,‚Ä¢ Ballpark,24 Nov,The greatest factor in ending homelessness is employment.  Open up businesses please so they can hire.
23,168583651,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,24 Nov,They will - as soon as people start behaving responsibly so others stop dying.
24,168583651,Jennifer Dillon,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,26 Nov,"There's the mother of all homeless encampment sweeps happening on Monday in Denver -- 300 people. The police have been directing people at all of their previous sweeps this summer and fall to go to this camp, and now they're going to scatter these folks to the 4 winds in the middle of a pandemic, right after Thanksgiving weekend. Anyone who is interested is needed for support. Support may mean food distribution, helping folks pack if needed/able, moving belongings, or just physically being there in solidarity. They will need 4x the amount of food and coffee and hands on deck as a typical sweep, so if you can't attend personally because you are working and wanted to contribute financially you can donate to Denver Homeless Out Loud."
25,168583651,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,29 Nov,That is bad. It solves absolutely nothing.
26,168583651,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,4 Dec,"Laura Leckband One thing it does though is show everyone how callous and uncaring our mayor and city council are.  Even after a protracted lawsuit, they continue to roust the homeless using the   public health ruse, take anything they can't take with them, and disperse them to ""nowhere"" where their helpers can't even find them to help them get into housing.  to make them crowd together to pack up and move then find another place to crowd together again will increase COVID-19 exposure as well.  This truly does not solve anything.  Shame on that lying Hancock of the ""sanctioned camps""."
27,168583651,Christine O'Connell,‚Ä¢ City Park,22w,"This makes me sad.  It's COLD. I mean, I'm cold in my house tonight and I have 4 walls and a roof (and heat, sort of). And this will only have space for 30 women.  I know, it's a start, but everytime I drive by that abandoned Royal hotel on Colfax and Colorado I think why can't the city just buy that, fix it up and get a Housing First plan up and running. I would think it would be more efficient to provide services if people were housed -- getting them clothes, food, therapy meetings.  I know, some people have mental health issues where they can't be inside, but really how many want to live in tents in freezing temps.  Call me whimpy.(edited)"
28,168583651,David Martin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,2 Dec,far better idea than turning the PHGC land into some outdoor campsite.  I've long thought that old motel could be refurbished or a better use...the land beneath it is likely worth  far more than the building and that's why it sits empty as an eyesore.
29,168583651,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,4 Dec,The amount of *white* privileged people in this thread is disgusting... You all should be ASHAMED. I lived right across the street from the St. Francis shelter for 18 MONTHS and NEVER experienced ANY problems!!! The homeless individuals keep to themselves! They aren‚Äôt trying to cause trouble!
30,168583651,Shirelle Guzman,‚Ä¢ Adams City,6 Dec,It's just overall sad. Who chooses to be homeless? Something has to really be wrong to just accept to live like that. Either way the people need help.
31,168583651,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,6 Dec,"I totally agree.  After working with Denver's street homeless every week for over 9 years and getting to know a lot of them, I have been challenged to answer why some of them seem to want to remain outside when given the chance of a shelter stay.  Then when I went to Jerry Burton's trial for violating the Urban Camping Ban when the judge considered the constitutionality of forcing people to go to shelters as an alternative to arrest, I learned a lot.  Some people have health problems that prevent them from sleeping all night (they can't just get up and sit or watch tv); others can't tolerate crowds due to PTSD; others have other mental health conditions that they can't express in shelters; some work late and can't get to a shelter in time before lockup; others have partners, children or pets that can't stay with them; and others do not trust the workers in the shelters to protect them or their belongings as they sleep.  "
32,168583651,Jessica Warren,‚Ä¢ Clayton,7 Dec,The single homeless people need more resources. I know personally how much help there is for homeless families. I am thankful for the help my family has gotten but with as much abandoned building and open land they could do more to help the people who don't have children.
33,168583651,Jessica Dempsey,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,6 Dec,"Are you high?  What an insane suggestion! No thanks, move along."
34,168583651,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,6 Dec,"I will gladly move along from someone who is unwilling to learn or consider the plight of other people.  No, not insane, just principled."
35,168583651,Keara F.,‚Ä¢ Sunnyside,8 Dec,I'd like to see locations that have pedestrian access to grocery stores that accept SNAP benefits and food pantries to be prioritized.
36,168583651,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,10 Dec,Right on!  there is a grocery at 40th just off Colorado with reasonable prices...

11,172018238,Jonell Herndon,‚Ä¢ Central Park,29 Dec,You should go take a flyer to the homeless camps on Smith Rd. They might have seen something and are out a lot.

13,172018238,Ed Munoz,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,29 Dec,There‚Äôs a female chow mix at Dumb Friends but she looks a little too brown but may be just the lighting? Worth a look.

15,172018238,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18w,On the Denver Animal website you can register and it will go to all shelters listed. Worth a try.  Still praying for your reunification.(edited)

According to the professional dog trackers involved, these paper posters are the best bet to locate the area sweet Mama Daphne has been calling home base. Please keep posters up! They are there to help find a great dog who deserves a chance at a great life. Please keep an eye out for anyone taking LOST DAPHNE CHOW signs down. All signs will be taken down by volunteers as soon as she is recovered. Thanks and Happy New Year!"

All pit bulls living in the city and county of Denver are supposed to be registered. What a joke. I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to your dog and to you. I have had to pick up my dog as well a couple of times to avoid him being attacked by an off leash dog.
8,175492846,Michele DB,‚Ä¢ Lowry,31 Jan,It seems leashing is an option. üôÑ Love when people think rules don‚Äôt apply to them. Super sad. And possibly very scary.
9,175492846,Rebecca Davidge,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,31 Jan,Last week a guy was walking his two dogs and didn‚Äôt have a tight enough grip and the dog took off and ran at my dog. A couple weeks ago at Verbena park a pitbull mutt wasn‚Äôt on the leash and ran at my dog. These off leash rules should be much more strict especially when you got a small dog and little kids walking around!!!!
10,175492846,Michele DB,‚Ä¢ Lowry,31 Jan,"Agreed. How in the heck can this even be enforced? When there‚Äôs an attack or even the threat of one, by the time you try to take any sort of action, the dog could run away or the owner can, or whatever, and then what do you do!?!? üò°"
11,175492846,Susan Pluss,‚Ä¢ Lowry,31 Jan,"Similar thing happened to me a few yers ago.  So scary, sorry this happened to you."
12,175492846,Mar√≠a Wetzel,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,31 Jan,"The same here very scary I didn‚Äôt even know how I managed to carried my dog he is kind of heavy, yes but I thought the pill bull would come after me, some are sweet but still unpredictable"
13,175492846,Michelle Birchby,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,31 Jan,Maybe we all need to start carrying a cattle prod. I wonder if that would make people more inclined to keep their dogs on leash and under control.
14,175492846,Michele DB,‚Ä¢ Lowry,14w,"Maybe you‚Äôre onto something...? At the very least, some sort of protection that can be accessed and used quickly.(edited)"
15,175492846,Shannon Daly,‚Ä¢ Central Park,31 Jan,Carry pepper spray.  Sabre makes a good one that is immediate and sprays pretty far but isn't damaging long term.  Might be a little easier to carry with you than a cattle prod? üòÅ
16,175492846,Edith Garcia,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,31 Jan,"I think we all should remember that it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have a pitbull, a puddle... or any other dog. As owners is OUR collective responsibility to keep our dogs leashed when in public. It doesn‚Äôt matter how amazing and well behaved your dogs are, it is a RULE! "
17,175492846,Kyra Frank,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,31 Jan,Agree! Wish people would follow the rules so no one makes stereotypes about breeds
18,175492846,Tasha Safford,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,31 Jan,"I'm sorry this happened to you, but there aren't bad dogs, inherently, just bad owners."
19,175492846,Edith Garcia,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,31 Jan,Completely agree

22,175492846,Aaron Wi,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,31 Jan,I hope David's dog is OK.   BTW is Shield Spray effective?  Thanks.
23,175492846,Jennifer Perlman,‚Ä¢ Central Park,1 Feb,"Hi David thank you for letting us know. I‚Äôm really sorry for you and your dog, I hope you two recover and the psychological impact fades over time. I Have had something less severe happen as well and it‚Äôs VERY upsetting. Peace"
24,175492846,Jeff Payne,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,1 Feb,"I think everyone agrees that, ""there are no bad dogs, only bad owners."" And while I understand that people want to jump in and defend pit bulls, and that their heart is in a good place, it distracts from the matter at hand: an unleashed aggressive dog attacked a leashed dog, and the owner of the aggressive dog showed zero accountability."
25,175492846,Suzanne Challinor,‚Ä¢ Central Park,1 Feb,"Dog on dog attacks are tragic enough. How would respondents react if that same unleashed, aggressive dog attacked a small child? Unimaginable horror. This goes beyond a lack of accountability."
26,175492846,Donovan Holligan,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,1 Feb,This is your best friend when it comes to aggressive dogs!!
27,175492846,Nadia Garcia,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,1 Feb,"Hi Donovan, where can I purchase that if you don‚Äôt mind me asking. I‚Äôm just afraid of a dog attacking my sons dog when we take him out for walks."
28,175492846,Dorothy Hotchkiss,‚Ä¢ Hale,1 Feb,I am so sorry this happened to you and your pup..I hope your pup is ok..

12,169449027,Caitlin Crowell,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,2 Dec,Might be a bad neighbor to them but probably a hero to the dog! Thank you for doing that! I think about doing that to a couple people around where I live.
13,169449027,Camille Lacey,‚Ä¢ Central Park,22w,"Yes! Cats too!! If its too cold for you to be outside, you should never force your pets outside. The absolute minimum temp for letting your cat out is 45. 50 degrees is better. Either way, cats should always have a warm place to come into wherever they are ready (aka your living room). Honestly,same for dogs. Dogs dont like being outside in the cold all day!! Poor things(edited)"

15,169449027,Bree Anderson,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,2 Dec,Denver and Aurora need to start charging owners with animal cruelty for this. It‚Äôs a felony now btw
16,169449027,Colin Dart,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,4 Dec,Totally agree. Animal abuse has no place in society. Harsh penalty‚Äôs including jail time would be a start...

18,169449027,Diane Dahl,‚Ä¢ Sable Altura Chambers,2 Dec,"Thank You, I hear dogs barking all day, one sounds small and like it is in pain.   Even in the summer....."
19,169449027,Dakota Richardson,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,2 Dec,Legally as long as the dog has shelter from the elements and access to food and water the only thing you can do is file a noise ordinance complaint. That being said some dogs like being outside. Given half the choice my girl would live outside if I let her. And dogs bark y'all. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 9x out if 10 they're barking at a perceived threat.
20,169449027,Caitlin Crowell,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,2 Dec,"Not the point of the message I‚Äôm trying to say at all. Obviously it‚Äôs different when you can tell a dog wants to be outside. But when I see a dog that is chained up outside, shaking, hiding underneath the trampoline, that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs a problem. I didn‚Äôt post this to complain about dogs barking, my point about them barking all day is that I can hear them barking all day which means they are outside all day"
21,169449027,Dakota Richardson,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,2 Dec,"And like I said. All you can do is report a noise ordinance complaint, that will cause AC to go out and from there they will determine if the dog is being neglected or not. But legally as long as it has shelter, food and water there's nothing that they'll do except fine the owner after multiple complaints. And you contradict yourself tbh. You say you didn't post to complain about the barking but yet your main topic of this post is the dog is outside barking all day. Or is it that you believe the dog is being neglected or abused because it's outside all day on a tie out and lays under a trampoline. Dogs shake and bark and whine and like to lay under things. Just because a dog isn't indoors 24/7 doesn't mean it's abused or neglected hun. Same with being on a tie out. If the dog is on a tie out it's probably to keep the dog in the yard. Not all dogs like to be tied out so they tend to bark/whine. If it's such an issue or it bothers you so bad then call animal control simple as that."
22,169449027,Caitlin Crowell,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,2 Dec,"My post was to simply remind people to not let there dogs be outside all day when it‚Äôs 19 degrees outside. And yes, my point of bringing up the barking was because it means the dog is outside all day because I can hear it. I do not care to hear the sound of a dog barking at all. I understand the whole noise complaint thing because you already said that in your previous post. This was in no way meant to start a fight. I understand why people have their dogs outside and why they are tied up because I have my own animals that have to go outside or have had to been tied up before. I also understand that dogs shake and bark and whine and I don‚Äôt need to be reminded of that. It sounds like you‚Äôre trying to defend or make excuses for people that leave their dogs outside all day, which is sad."

31,169449027,Nancy Sloane,‚Ä¢ Lowry,3 Dec,"The Dumb Friends League has a cruelty investigation department. I tried to report an outside dog during an extreme cold spell one winter. Because I didn't have an exact address for where the barking was coming from, they couldn't follow up & check on the dog.  See if you can figure out the correct address, then contact DDFL. I think it's a recorded message line so go ahead & call, even if it's in the middle of the night. I continually tried to figure out where the barking was coming from by walking my dog around the street, stopping when I thought I heard the barking. Sadly, noise travels and echos so I was never able to specifically pinpoint which house's backyard the barking came from. üòî"
32,169449027,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,22w,"I‚Äôve done that too. I then leave a message telling the people there that their dog is distressed and that they need to bring it inside when the temp is below freezing as well as providing it with shelter and water when it‚Äôs outside. If the problem continues then I call authorities. Some people really don‚Äôt have the first clue but once I let them know what they should be doing if they are still negligent, I will call and let officials deal with them(edited)"

The city needs to honor the agreement made to voters when we paid Clayton to keep the property as open space.
1,179869597,Kate Hakala,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,12 Mar,"Absolutely!   The intent of the conservation easement that the city taxpayers was that this property never be developed.   Wellington Webb, Federico Pena and Gov Lamm have all spoken out against removal of the easement.   But the developers gave Hancock $400,000 so they got a sweetheart deal"
2,179869597,Harry Doby,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,8w,"Assuming the city can tear up the $2million conservation easement, that will instantly increase the value of the property 3 or 4 fold.  Then Westside can do what they have done in the past and sell off part of the land.   At the newly appraised higher value they could probably sell the 60 acres for ""parks"" back to the city for, oh say, $24 to 30 million?(edited)"
3,179869597,Jeremiah Zentz,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,12 Mar,Sounds like their intent is to push through development
4,179869597,Harry Doby,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,12 Mar,There is no mention at all about the conservation easement in the survey.  We added our comment on the final line that to us it is a fatal omission for a statistically valid survey.
5,179869597,Allie Ess,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,12 Mar,"I got this survey and I have only been in the area for a year, but like the other commenters I emphasized the desire to keep this area as open space. I commented that it would be nice to have sidewalks added to parks in the neighborhood that are missing sidewalk in some stretches and that it would be nice to have trash cans/service in the PHGC open space if it is kept as such."
6,179869597,Fredrick Glick,‚Ä¢ Clayton,12 Mar,"I have yet to see the survey, but generally when ""Affordable"" is used in this context (and most especially when it is used by the city and  capitalized) it refers to some level of income restricted housing, generally starting at 80% of AMI (area median income) and often going as low as 30% of AMI.  The most recent AMI levels for Denver can be found here:  https://www.denvergov.org/content/dam/denvergov/Portals/housing-resources/documents/2020AMI.pdf"
7,179869597,Shane Murphy,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,12 Mar,Thanks for sharing this info Fredrick Glick - hope you are well.
8,179869597,Shane Murphy,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,12 Mar,"Hello Neighbors, Harry Doby - thank you for pointing this out. If this survey truly does not highlight the fact that the Conservation Easement would have to be removed, then i do not believe this is an accurate survey. Simply put - the community does not have the full facts to be able to answer the questions in an educated way. What a horrible display of a corrupt process. Regardless of your beliefs on the matter, asking to answer without all the details is not appropriate. We need to ensure this is brought to the attention of the planning and steering committee. I believe this survey is already invalid and should be thrown out for a new survey."
9,179869597,Fredrick Glick,‚Ä¢ Clayton,12 Mar,"If there is any outcome other than an 18 hole golf course, the easement will at the very least need to be amended."
10,179869597,sadie martinez,‚Ä¢ Central Park,12 Mar,"Affordable housing means lower than market rent , the income limits in Denver for a 2 bedroom unit is $1297. This is updated yearly and it is the area median income"
11,179869597,Kate Swan,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,8w,"I read the survey.  Not surprisingly, it seems to be designed to elicit the responses the city wishes to receive.  For example, in one question, they ask, ""In addition to the parks and recreation opportunities identified in Question 4, which of the following uses and services would you also want to see at this site (if any).""  Such question is clearly designed to suggest that development of the land in some form is going to occur, and that they want input about what kind of development it should be.  But, in fact, the most critical question (which should have been answered BEFORE city funds were used to facilitate this process) is whether any portion of the land can be developed where the conservation easement paid for by Denver taxpayers seems to prevent it.

No kill doesn't actually mean ""no kill"", it's very misleading. ""No kill' generally means the shelter has a 90%+ live release rate. Shelters will still euthanize if it's in the best interest of the animal (suffering or poor quality of life) or the animal is considered unsafe to adopt due to behavior."

Personally we adopted an awesome dog from A Friend of Jack, they were very easy to work with and communicative and flexible. If you are looking for a specific size of dog, I would use the Pet Finder website. It will aggregate all the available dogs from tons of places so you don't have to individually search every rescues page. I'd double check the rescue'd google reviews before you apply just to make sure they are a reputable organization."
19,176661150,Lynn Wagner,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Feb,"Yes, this is sound advice to use Petfinder + rescue recommendations. Keep a list of Rescues of Yes/No, because after a while, they all sound the same."

0,178870327,Jaxson Heyrend,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,2 Mar,"See the thing about police reports, is that they usually go nowhere if there is no evidence. Police will usually say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but there‚Äôs not much we can do unless we have a lead to who commit the crime.‚Äù Whereas, if the community is aware of what‚Äôs going on, then more people are likely to witness crimes and will likely lead to an arrest. If the community is aware of the situation, then people are more likely to be more proactive in stopping the crime from happening.

6,178870327,Wendy Booth,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,2 Mar,It‚Äôs important to find a balance. Considering every little thing out of the ordinary ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù is emotionally draining and potentially discriminatory. But we also need to keep each other informed. Common sense in reporting activity and protection of self go a long way towards building healthier communities.
7,178870327,Audrey Maddox,‚Ä¢ City Park,5 Mar,"I agree, making posts about someone standing somewhere in some odd way is unnecessary."
8,178870327,Brooke Haddock,‚Ä¢ Central Park,9w,I get what you‚Äôre saying. Our neighborhood lives reporting any person walking in an alley or any ‚Äústrange‚Äù (read: anyone not recognized) car in the alleys. Drives me nuts and is most definitely discriminatory.(edited)
9,178870327,David Navarro,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,2 Mar,"I think if you see something odd or suspicious you should be encouraged to call the police.  (Thats what they tell you to do!!)   Wouldn't be so much crime if everyone watched out for odd, strange, out of place, or suspicious activity so everyone should watch out, thats really what your supposed to do, were supposed to keep an eye out for that, the neighborhood watch stuff has worked for YEARS, it's a proven fact it works to keep crimes down, thats a good neighbor!"
10,178870327,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,4 Mar,I agree wholeheartedly you live in a community. You need to watch out for one another. There several times I've gone up to people and said he what she up to. Knowing that someone's prowling around someone's home. Sometimes posting here a neighbor has seen something that might help. Or at least give emotional support. You can turn off notifications.  That I certainly Appreciate I heads up.
11,178870327,Tatiana Masterson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,2 Mar,"Nextdoor is the perfect place to reach out to neighbors and be in touch about issues in the neighborhood. The neighborhood watch forming now is due to activities reported by neighbors here. I would not have known about certain activities if they would not be posted on Nextdoor. If they make you feel uncomfortable or anxious, perhaps skipping these posts would be a better solution then asking neighbors not to report them as often. I say this respectfully."
12,178870327,Brooke Haddock,‚Ä¢ Central Park,2 Mar,I‚Äôm excited about the neighborhood watch and fully support that. It‚Äôs just the middle of the day and someone walked by and looked at my house posts that seem fear based and not fact based. People should be able to walk around without being deemed ‚Äúsuspicious ‚Äú.
13,178870327,Tatiana Masterson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,9w,"Brooke Haddock, what we are talking about is the opposite of people walking around being ‚Äòsuspicious‚Äô. It‚Äôs about people pepping into our homes, steeling packages, trespassing, opening car doors, breaking into cars, breaking cars windows and handles, following us, home invasion and that kind of stuff. Nobody is looking for ‚Äòsuspicious‚Äô people as we don‚Äôt know what a suspicious person looks like.(edited)"
14,178870327,Charlene/Joseph Medina,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,3 Mar,I agree üíØ! I sleep well and I want to continue to do so. Most of these reports come from people who have those video cameras but they still don‚Äôt catch the suspect. Thank you for your request.
15,178870327,Genn La,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,3 Mar,Ignore or scroll past the posts or even delete the app I think it‚Äôs helpful for those of us who are concerned about our neighborhoods. Sorry it is a ‚Äúsmall post‚Äù to you but may not be to others.
16,178870327,Kristi Steinbron,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,9w,"Almost 3 years in this neighborhood. The crime and ""suspicious activity"" did not used to be as much as it is now. But I still live off Colfax, so I still pay attention and lock my doors etc. However, Nextdoor I think has been a great tool for communicating with people in the neighborhood about anything and everything. Not just crime and suspension. I haven't been a regular poster but, I think it's a good thing. People don't know their neighbors well enough these days. I spent the last 7 years in Cap Hill before Mayfair. I've seen enough. Pandemic and unemployment has crime on the rise. Keep an eye out. The whole neighborhood doesn't live off Colfax, but the increase in illegal activity would suggest otherwise. If you're scared, maybe this is not the neighborhood for you. Maybe the suburbs. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But, I dunno about discouraging the people in the neighborhood to not communicate with each other.. just so one person doesn't have to be scared. That seems a bit ignorant of reality. Don't use the app. Turn off the notification. The local news has just as many reports of bad things happening. The world we live in can only improve if we work together and communicate. "
17,178870327,Latoyia Hough,‚Ä¢ Clayton,18 Mar,"I agree with you 100% with what you just said. We need this app to inform us with what‚Äôs going in our neighborhood.  I appreciate knowing when someone pet is missing and I can help be on the lookout. When someone car been broken into and other meaningful post. However, it‚Äôs unfortunate that only one person is overwhelm with the app sensitive information being posted. I agree that that person can delete the app entirely and don‚Äôt have to be scared, nervous, panicky and Whatever else that‚Äôs going on with the person."

22,178870327,Heather Mann,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Mar,I think it is good to be informed and when things are posted it helps us all be aware. Usually the people posting things are calling the police too but it‚Äôs looking out for everyone.  If it tends to cause anxiety I would just take a break from next door or maybe just don‚Äôt look at the posts but for many it really does help people to be more cautious and alert    üíõ
23,178870327,Debbie Livingood,‚Ä¢ Sunny Vale,3 Mar,"It's good to post those things here, it keeps everyone else alert and what to watch out for. If you are feeling uneasy about the posts, don't read them and keep scrolling. Living off Colfax is nothing but a reason for something to happen and always has been."
24,178870327,Stacey Clerk,‚Ä¢ Lowry,3 Mar,"The reason we are on this app is for the safety information, it's great that everybody posts things to keep us all up to date. Maybe instead of asking the neighborhood to censor safety hazards and risks, perhaps you could reach out to the next door app and see if they could create a feature where you could filter out the safety items so that you don't have to see it, but everybody else still gets to benefit from the great information that is shared."
25,178870327,Monica Bryant-Taylor,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,6 Mar,"She's holding it in her hand!  She can filter her settings, delete the app or keep scrolling so she doesn't have to read those posts."

11,168281283,Jessica Webb,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Nov,Hi neighbors - I forgot that were also looking for a baby swing. She has one but could really use one more.

17,168281283,Jessica Webb,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Nov,Hi Sara - if it‚Äôs in good shape other than the drawer I think it would work. Is there any chance you have a truck or vehicle you could deliver with? I don‚Äôt right now so it‚Äôs complicating things a bit.
18,168281283,Jacqueline P Moore,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,19 Nov,Hi I would like to help I have a microwave

2,170179162,Jerrica Zimmermann,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Dec,Laura Avant Hi! I have a bunch of beanies I‚Äôd love to donate. They may nor be the absolute warmest but they‚Äôre brand new; my mom crocheted them for me to pass out to the homeless but this feels like a great opportunity to give them away. Please let me know if you‚Äôre interested :)
3,170179162,Denise Nation,‚Ä¢ Locust St,8 Dec,"Hi Laura, I am moving and have lots of clothing food and bedding. I will gather some things tomorrow morning."
4,170179162,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,10 Dec,"Thank you so much!  Most of the ""stuff"" is ready for my  manager to pick up, but I did save some really nice things (Italian designer clothes, leather jackets) to sell online to make cash for underwear, socks and toiletries.  I will press it up and post it on the NE neighborhood site, so if you see things that that were yours, rest assured that all the proceeds will  go to the homeless.  I have also pulled a lot of the children's things to give to the ARC in return for my $200 monthly vouchers, so  you have helped me indirectly there too.  Thank your son for being generous..  Watch out or he could become a social  worker and don't want that."

I would love to meet you somewhere to receive your donation or ask you to drop it off at my house.  I can only go out on Thursday and Friday before a COVID test on Sat and double quarantine until my surgery on Tuesday, but my husband may be willing to come to you.  If you would like to contact me quickly, my phone no. is 303-316-6748.  I can give you our address when you call or we can arrange a pick up..  Thank you so much!  It will all go out to the homeless next week."

Rather than give your address during such times as this, here ins my phone number:  303-316-6748.  We will be home as I double quarantine after my COVID test and before my Tuesday surgery.  The homeless people  will get it that week as my manager goes to the camps several evenings per week.  Thank you so much!"
0,182982262,Jessica Beffa,‚Ä¢ Central Park,10 Apr,My brother felt tired for a week and had a headache one night on first dose. Second dose less of an effect.
1,182982262,Jared Christopher,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Apr,"Hi Christa, my wife and I have received both does of the Pfizer vaccine. After the first dose my wife had a sore arm the next day and I was business as usual. For us the second dose is where we saw side effects. The day after the second we both had the chills, joint/muscle pain, and she had a headache. The next day all symptoms were gone and we felt normal. "
2,182982262,Jared Enos,‚Ä¢ RiNo Art District,14 Apr,"Same experience here for our first dose, haven't had the second yet."

6,182982262,Kari Devine,‚Ä¢ Central Park,10 Apr,"I was a little tired the day after my first shot. The second shot I woke up at 3am with a fever, took ibuprofen, and was just exhausted the rest of the day. Around 4pm I felt completely fine."
7,182982262,Billy Ott,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,10 Apr,Hubby had both doses. No sore arm and no side effects from either one.
8,182982262,Merrilee Saathoff,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,10 Apr,Have had both doses. Soreness at injection site worse after first one and felt lethargic that day. Plenty of hydration before and after helpful.
9,182982262,DeeAnne Held,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,10 Apr,I‚Äôve had both shots.  Sore arm both times and fatigue after the second.  But the relief that I‚Äôd had them was wonderful!
10,182982262,Jason Grout,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,10 Apr,After the first shot I had slight reactions similer to a cold. Second shot had no sysmtoms. But i have heard diffrent things from others. So it must vary from person to person.
11,182982262,Brian Burke,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Apr,"Had both doses.  Sore arm for a day, but that was it."
12,182982262,Craig Hansel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Apr,"Had both doses. No issues. Arm sore, not badly but more so than a flu shot."
13,182982262,Cindy Keesom,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,10 Apr,My husband and I had exactly the same experience as you. We‚Äôre very relieved to have gotten the vaccines.
14,182982262,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,10 Apr,Both of my children received their first shot this past Monday. No side effects at all - just a sore arm at the shot site.

17,182982262,Marie Salame,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Apr,"My husband was fine after the first, the second was rough though- fever, pain, etc. Totally worth it, but giving yourself about 48 hours off for scheduling may be helpful."
18,182982262,Doug Lasky,‚Ä¢ Central Park,10 Apr,"No reaction after first shot. Had low grade fever, chills and exhaustion approx twelve hours after second shot.  Felt normal eight hours later."
19,182982262,Nadine Rains,‚Ä¢ Aurora,10 Apr,My first vaccine wasn‚Äôt bad. Just a week of arm soreness! My second one made me feel like I had a cold for a week. Take time to rest!
20,182982262,Nicole Gravagna,‚Ä¢ Montbello,10 Apr,"First dose I had a sore arm for a day. Still waiting on second dose. My partner and parents are fully vaccinated with pfizer and they each reported a minor immune response (general feeling of illness) for a day or so after the second dose. From what I understand, that's what you want to happen. A little immune system activation."

They have to have the logo on them. They're $15/each if you go through the front office. And watch for Childrens Place to have their sales on uniform bottoms. That usually happens towards the end of the school year. It's good quality at good prices. Don't have them ship to the store. It's a mess in there. Have them ship directly to you. GL Momma.

3,176251823,Scott Bulfin,‚Ä¢ Central Park,7 Feb,Agree with a lot of your post! The plusses of cities are there a lot of things to see and do. The negatives- more crime unfortunately-especially the car break ins and garage thefts.

8,176251823,Burt Keems,‚Ä¢ Central Park,8 Feb,Alan I also agree your point with  living in a city. There seems to be an escalating sense of angst and criminal behavior growing day by day. That topped with an ever increasing homeless population it is slowly becoming a not so nice place to live. From the nightly gun shots to car break-ins and thefts things are truly trending down. Not trying to be a ‚ÄúDebbie-Downer‚Äù but we are in some strange times.

If you lived near enough to the trains you had to be careful about feeding them.  They would put a sign on your fence or door and soon you would be able to open your own soup kitchen.
16,176251823,Paul Blundell,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Feb,So
17,176251823,Haley Wallace,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,9 Feb,Bye?
18,176251823,Danielle Miller,‚Ä¢ Montbello,10 Feb,Welcome to Denver
19,176251823,Tav Maroncelli,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,11w,"I grew up in Denver and the results from the tremendous influx of so many people has been heartbreaking. I know some amazing transplants so I won't blame them. The issues we face are so complex and when money is a driving force, it's hard to create community. Not impossible but it takes intention.(edited)"
20,176251823,Burt Keems,‚Ä¢ Central Park,21 Feb,"Shootings, Shootings everywhere. There were several north of the Clayton neighborhood. So I don‚Äôt know if the problem are guns, money or just mental illness. But anyway a city should have services set up for people in need."

2,175105787,Joyce Singular,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,27 Jan,Love this store
3,175105787,Nancy Cloos Nettell,‚Ä¢ Lowry,27 Jan,"If you have a cat (or more than one!), this is one of the very few cat-exclusive boutiques in the US. Definitely worth a visit. "
4,175105787,Azul Farrera,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,27 Jan,Definitely checking it out. Thanks for sharing!
5,175105787,Susan Schmidt,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,28 Jan,It is a great place. I am adopting a kitty from there today! Nicole and Bonnie are special!!
6,175105787,Char Smith,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,28 Jan,"Awww, I had no idea it was even there! I wish I had seen this a couple of weeks ago. I am adopting today from Cat Care Society in Lakewood because DFL had so few."

11,175105787,Paula Keenan,‚Ä¢ Central Park,28 Jan,I foster for the same rescue as Nicole and I can attest that nobody has a bigger heart for the kitties than Nicole. She believes that every kitty deserves an opportunity for a home. Definitely check her out (and check out the best catnip pouches ever!) Or just go pet the kitties!

4,176048605,Jane Skarka,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,5 Feb,"Omg, she looks so frightened. Have you had her checked for a chip? Make sure someone gives you proof that she is theirs. There are lots of abandoned pets right now during these difficult times. That photo just breaks my heart."
5,176048605,Richard Souder,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Feb,"Yeah, she absolutely seems well taken care of, but I waited around for 20-25 minutes and no one came. How do I find out if she's chipped? At a vet?"

7,176048605,Robin Jones,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Feb,Let me know if you need any help if you don‚Äôt have pup supplies until they pick her up. I think I‚Äôve seen her in Verbena park too with her humans.
8,176048605,Richard Souder,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Feb,"Okay! I live right near Verbena Park, but I found her out on the other side of Great Lawn."

12,176048605,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Feb,Actually she sounds better off with you than her original people who left her outside in the cold and aren‚Äôt coming to look for her!!

14,176048605,Richard Souder,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Feb,"I'm on my way to the vet now to see if she's chipped, but if she's not; I will keep and love her!"
15,176048605,Ann Burke,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 Feb,"Dear God, man- is your plan to break all of Nextdoor?! You just blew our brains.

16,176048605,Richard Souder,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Feb,She's asleep on my lap right now: no trust issues here! Haha
17,176048605,Anne Delphia,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,5 Feb,You are the best.  Also I‚Äôm sure you know this but if someone comes to claim m her make sure she knows them.  You will know by the way she reacts to them or have them identify something on her that they can‚Äôt see from picture.  Thanks again.
18,176048605,Richard Souder,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Feb,"Anne Delphia good idea, thanks!"

0,180874084,Kay Dragon,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,21 Mar,Good question because sometimes I like to tip in cash hoping that the driver gets it
1,180874084,Amands Mamah,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,21 Mar,I work for door dash and we do get the whole tip we get as little as 3$ before tip though and takes a minimum of 30 mins to drive to the restaurant wait for the food and deliver it. Then take into consideration if you are In an apartment or business office.
2,180874084,Kaytee Cowperthwaite,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,21 Mar,Do you get paid a percentage of the total of the order? Or by mileage? Or a flat rate?
3,180874084,Leigha Fillenworth,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,7w,"I worked for Instacart a little over a year ago... And their system works this same way.  Of course with Instacart, I did all of the shopping myself from several different varieties of stores, but I found it to be quite beneficial. I didn't ""work hard"" at all..  an average of 3-4 days a week, between 6-12 deliveries (depending on size of delivery), approximately 6 hrs per day...averaged out to be a good $150-250/WK (tips incl).  Keep in mind...  I had a Suburban at that point in time, so I could manage some large loads.   Anyways.. hope that helps a bit.(edited)"
4,180874084,Amands Mamah,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,21 Mar,It‚Äôs a percentage of the total I think we don‚Äôt get to see what your total is I can just estimate by what I pick up.
5,180874084,Therese Zylla,‚Ä¢ Tower Triangle,22 Mar,I know Walmart delivery‚Äôs are through a third party. You can chose the amount when you are placing your order. 
6,180874084,Jill Getz,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,22 Mar,"Walmart also uses Door Dash :).  They give you a flat fee for picking up and then can also have a peak price added ( if applicable). And then the person you deliver it to can up their tip if they want. I have done quite well with door dash as far as what I make and tips, except for the guy that left me a penny üò¢üò¢. I would have rather gotten nothing !!!  Otherwise it is a fun gig to have üòä"
7,180874084,Kaytee Cowperthwaite,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,22 Mar,"Jill, is the flat fee based on the purchase price or is it the same for all orders?"
8,180874084,Jill Getz,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,22 Mar,Kaytee Cowperthwaite here is a sample of my pay. I will also find a Walmart one for reference
9,180874084,Jill Getz,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,22 Mar,Here is Walmart
10,180874084,Madison Rodgers,‚Ä¢ Locust St,28 Mar,Do you do the shopping for Walmart orders? I know when I order like Walgreens or Dashmart from doordash you guys have to pick the stuff out. But I always wondered about Walmart.
11,180874084,Kaytee Cowperthwaite,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,22 Mar,"Awesome, thank you!!!"
12,180874084,Jill Getz,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,22 Mar,Just remember these are just samples from my working :):)
13,180874084,Desiree Sandoval,‚Ä¢ Central Park,22 Mar,"I work in a restaurant, and have a ton of issues with doordash. I do not reccomend using them."
14,180874084,Charras Scott,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Mar,As experience working for door dash and in many group I see so many customers will fake a complaint saying they didn‚Äôt get there food just to get more food or a refund!
15,180874084,Jill Getz,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,7w,"That‚Äôs not all drivers. Some of us need the money bad enough, we deliver !!!!!(edited)"
16,180874084,Desiree Sandoval,‚Ä¢ Central Park,22 Mar,For sure not all. That's just the one I get the most problems with. We have a ton of deliveries that go thru doordash with no problems. But also the most issues with them
17,180874084,Jodi Garza,‚Ä¢ Sable Altura Chambers,23 Mar,With Doordash it's more the app than the drivers... always try to cash tip...  with restaurant deliveries... Instacart is a base of $8. Plus % of order. We get 100% of tips.
18,180874084,Charras Scott,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Mar,"I work door dash, post mates and fetch I can send you a link to that"
19,180874084,Charras Scott,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Mar,Fetch application 
20,180874084,Abeth Parisian,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Mar,"Are the delivery workers only earning $3 for a delivery?  Is it just $3 or minimum wage plus $3 (and possible tip)?  If it‚Äôs just $3 and tips, how can one live on that?  (I am not at all implying minimum wage and $3 is a livable income)."
21,180874084,Madison Rodgers,‚Ä¢ Locust St,6w,"Some deliveries don't take very long so you can do multiple an hour. And I think maybe you can pick up more than one order at a time? Not sure. Plus DoorDash automatically selects a ""suggested tip"" which I think is 15%, but you can take it off or change it... I don't know how many people change it. For me a $40 order is like a $7 tip."
22,180874084,Jodi Garza,‚Ä¢ Sable Altura Chambers,24 Mar,"It's not the best , but it fits into alot of people's schedules. Most of the time they do 3 to 4 deliveries an hour.."
0,179223880,Heidi Kabir,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,6 Mar,"Denver is truly the Wild, Wild West. Brazen, unapologetic lawlessness at a level I have never encountered before. Makes bigger cities look so tame."
1,179223880,David Rochlin,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,6 Mar,"This latest incident almost doesn't even rise to the level of theft. What's the market value (on Nextdoor, perhaps?) of those pillows? The ""thief"" might get $2 for them, even though it's a $50-100 cost to you to replace them. It seems more like vandalism. Pretty poor pay for being outside walking around, perhaps for hours, at 3 am. And who's going to buy a security camera from some random person who obviously stole it? Another pointless act of pillaging."
2,179223880,Bev Laughlin,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,6 Mar,"Rosemary,"
3,179223880,Rosemary Adams,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,7 Mar,Thanks Bev - it‚Äôs so disheartening to see an uptick in this kind of activity but we have been reporting everything to the police so hopefully we see more of them out in the neighborhood. Hope you have been well!
4,179223880,shannon quillian,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,6 Mar,That is sooooo Wrong in sooo many ways. I am so sad and sorry this happened to you all
5,179223880,Craigers Hanzelka,‚Ä¢ Central Park,7 Mar,"I am sorry you have been dealing with this. First and foremost, since Brinks is your choice of security camera service(if you are in fact paying a monthly fee), they should be held responsible for the ""pilfering"" of your possessions."
6,179223880,Terry Sipes,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,7 Mar,The line of daily/nightly theft has pushed itself south from North Colfax to open game from Alameda North these past five years. I lived in Mayfair for 10 years never heard of such a thing back then. 
7,179223880,Susan Palmer,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,9w,"I‚Äôm sorry this happened. Having lived in Denver my whole life, I‚Äôve never seen crime at this rate. There are many explanations for it but the main reason is that due to the movement of defunding the police.  Our police force is that of 1982. Denver was much less populated then.  COVID hasn‚Äôt helped either. Perpetrators know they won‚Äôt go to jail, especially for property crimes. This makes them more brazen.(edited)"
8,179223880,Joan Baronberg,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,7 Mar,How come we never hear from our Mayor? Where is he?
9,179223880,Susan Palmer,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,7 Mar,"Joan Baronberg, he hasn‚Äôt cared about Denver since his first term. He had used the office for his own benefit regardless of what the people of Denver want or need."
10,179223880,Gina Dunn,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Mar,Seriously? Stealing pillows? That is one pathetic soul... I think the word is ‚Äú loser‚Äù
11,179223880,Terry Sipes,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,7 Mar,"In my opinion, simple comments on Nextdoor wont get the issue resolved, only hard (real news) action will slow this process down.  It's up to every individual on your block, neighborhood, that will make a difference. From telling little Johnny to not leave his bike in the yard, forget you left the garage door open, your $5K bike hanging from the garage ceiling and having a open window view to the nice things on your not so private front porch...sad times...planning will help, so those that read this...think if you want too,  how can I make my home a more solid fortress and fix the issues at hand (you don't want to be the  next victim), that is what part of Sunday is made for in my mind, property maintenance... Harbor Freight has great cheap cameras, ring as well, HD/Lowes have gate locks, security light, solar to hard wired.. lots of fencing companies in Denver metro...yes sad but its your property to enjoy and to protect. "
12,179223880,Gloria BURNS,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Mar,"I'm with you Terry i have been saying this a long time ago,people think all they have to do is put up a camera and life is safe.how many people have gotten any feed back from the police or the city.we have to take responsibility for our home if you know you are going to have delivery ask for it to be left at a safe place like the post office.the police is not going to investigate all of the theft we have not just in Denver but all over the country.there is more of us than cops let's help each others one way is by just looking into  the suggestion we are getting and try to help our selves if you steal something from me once i am going to learn from that and figure out how it won't happen again I am getting the feeling that people have a lot of money. i sure wish someone can give me a couple hundred (SMILE) PEACE HAVE A GREAT SUNDAY"
13,179223880,Gregory Clark,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,7 Mar,Does anyone know if its ok to taser a porch pirate?
14,179223880,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Mar,"I'd like to dream up some kind of nasty prank so that no laws are broken and nobody has to go to court to justify their actions. The poop-in-a-box for porch pirates was a great example of giving one back to the thieves. Too bad crazy glue dries quickly because I'd love to coat things with crazy glue and then the thieves come and pick it up and find out they can't put it down without tearing the skin off their hands. I'd like to dream up some kinds of retaliations like that - things that would ""serve them right"" but not get anyone doing the prank in any legal trouble."
15,179223880,Gloria BURNS,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Mar,"Before you do check with the law,some  time the bad guys have more rights"
16,179223880,Gill Miles,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,7 Mar,"It is sad to say that the criminals have figured out that they have more rights than we do. I guess I really don't understand how a person is allowed to sell a CATALYTIC CONVERTER to a scrap yard, especially when they know that it is stolen. I am proposing a new law that simply states that if you sell a CAT CONVERTER to a scrap yard, you have to have state issued I.D. and the V.I.N. number of the vehicle that the CAT CONVERTER came off of."
17,179223880,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Mar,The VIN number now is visible in the front windshield. In my older cars I was able to put something on the dash to cover it but now it's embedded inside the dash itself so you can't obscure it.
18,179223880,MARCIA CORUM WIEBKE,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Mar,We live in Park Hill 15th & Elm St. and at 2am on Friday night someone tried to steal our gargoyles from the front porch. They found out pretty quickly that the resin gargoyles are mounted on a very heavy concrete base. I think they then got mad and pushed one off and it broke into many pieces. One survived and will no longer reside on the front porch. Very disturbing and has me thinking about moving to the suburbs which is not where I want to live.
19,179223880,Lawrence Johnston,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,7 Mar,I often drive through your area on my way home from work at it is a great part of the world. How much would a new gargoyle cost versus having to move? Last week someone stole a parcel with replacement light switches from my porch. Am I angry and upset? Absolutely. I will not relocate over this.
20,179223880,Gloria BURNS,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Mar,"Sorry there are more bad people on this earth than good people, i just watch the news a mother throw her six year old son in a lake.they are trying to find his body just remember this seventh day of march it is going to get so bad only God is going to be able to save us.i had things stolen from me went to the pond shop but could not get my stuff.all we can do is figure out how to lock it down try You Tub see what suggestion you can get then you see what you can come up with,just remember the police can't look at all the pictures and go out looking for the bad thieves they don't have the budget for that,you will make it God will take care off you just think something good is going to come your way (peace)"
21,179223880,Dorothy Todd,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Mar,"We certainly hear more about the bad people but I've found many good, helpful, kind folks and very few bad."

23,179223880,Gregory Clark,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,8 Mar,"Excellent idea! I was also thinking about maybe making a retractable cord attached to the box that had Barbwire on it, or maybe delivered a slight electric shock, low-voltage of course.  This is said slightly tongue in cheek, I‚Äôm not actually a vindictive person, just a little tired and feeling mean today."
24,179223880,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Mar,Gregory Clark  Won't physically hurt them. banks do it when they're robbed they throw bombs in their bags
25,179223880,MJ Fuller,‚Ä¢ Lowry,8 Mar,"I'm sorry this happened to you.  It's maddening to watch the footage.  I've removed everything from my front porch.  It looks bare and boring, but it's better than having jerks walk off with my stuff.  Hopefully you've moved those nice Adirondack chairs by now.  I'd even bring the doormat inside.  Take care."
26,179223880,Gregory Clark,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,9 Mar,"Lmao, I am removing all decorative items from my house as well. Considering having the trees and sod Dug up and sold at auction before someone steals it."

17,167119420,Elle H.,‚Ä¢ Chermont,10 Nov,Aquila C. thank you! My youngest brother will be doing the same as you at LAX. You are one of the unsung heroes.
18,167119420,Ken Haynes,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,8 Nov,You did not give us the option of ignoring it.
19,167119420,Paul D.,‚Ä¢ Cinnimon Courtyard,10 Nov,"Um, isn‚Äôt the option to ignore something a contradiction?!"
20,167119420,Tanya Field,‚Ä¢ Gateway,9 Nov,I‚Äôm working on Thanksgiving. Where‚Äôs that option?

32,167119420,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,10 Nov,"Same for me, except I don't have golden retrievers; I have a mixed-breed and a malamute. I've made Thanksgiving dinner for just myself for many years. It's a lot of work but I love that meal and it gives me a whole bunch of leftovers so I don't have to mess with fixing any other food for the next week! I enjoy it because I can fix what I want and nobody complains about anything.  :D"

0,183274903,Beth Toles,‚Ä¢ Apache Mesa,12 Apr,Why haven't you called the police??
1,183274903,Carmen Calavera,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,12 Apr,"Beth Toles - They won't do anything, they don't even respond to cars being broken into. Also, I just drive by the car everyday, so I thought I'd post it here to see if it was anyone's."
2,183274903,Tatiana Masterson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,4w,"If you haven‚Äôt done so, try reporting to parking enforcement if the VIN number on the windshield can be seen.(edited)"
3,183274903,Carmen Calavera,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,12 Apr,Tatiana Masterson - Parking Aurora has been in the neighborhood at least twice already.
4,183274903,Meekaame H.,‚Ä¢ Highline Villages,12 Apr,That‚Äôs someone‚Äôs car call in the vin number if you have it I can try to get someone to run it.. take a picture of it in the window or on the license plate holder
5,183274903,Meekaame H.,‚Ä¢ Highline Villages,12 Apr,And DM me with cross streets too
6,183274903,Joe F.,‚Ä¢ Cedar Cove,13 Apr,Meekaame Houston you can sometimes trace vins online.
7,183274903,Lori Morell,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,12 Apr,"There was a car parked and sitting for months on the street in front of my house.  I contacted the PAR  officer who checked it out, found out who it belonged to, and it was moved."
8,183274903,Kayla Banks,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,12 Apr,Thank you Carmen no it is not my car
9,183274903,Carolyn Boller,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,12 Apr,turn it into code enforcement.
10,183274903,Edgar van Veen,‚Ä¢ Highland Park East,12 Apr,Just call the police! They‚Äôll tow away.
11,183274903,Carmen Calavera,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,12 Apr,"Edgar van Veen - The cops won't come out. And it's not a bother to me, just trying to help someone maybe missing their car."
12,183274903,Edgar van Veen,‚Ä¢ Highland Park East,12 Apr,"We had a similar situation & the police tag it with yellow tags, if nobody moves the vehicle in 3 days, they impound it, if there‚Äôs no plates, then they will do a search via vin number. In any case, this is the PROPER WAY TO DO IT!"
13,183274903,Carmen Calavera,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,4w,"Edgar van Veen - Well, as I stated eariler, I know nothing about this car and it doesn't bother me one bit as it is not on my block, and to possibly save someone the headache of having to deal with an impound fee, I posted this here just in case. Also, if Park Aurora patrols the area and have been through at least twice, I don't see why they haven't done their job to either tag or have it removed.(edited)"
14,183274903,Edgar van Veen,‚Ä¢ Highland Park East,12 Apr,"I really need to add that this is the ONLY WAY FOR THE OWNERS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR CAR! The police WILL contact the proper owners! You can‚Äôt, so let the police do their duty! They WILL RESPOND TO AN ABANDONED CAR COMPLAINT!!"
15,183274903,Larissa Chmielewski,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,12 Apr,No.  They won‚Äôt show up.  They‚Äôve already driven by it 100 times.
16,183274903,Edgar van Veen,‚Ä¢ Highland Park East,12 Apr,"As I said, YOU must call and complain! I guarantee that they will act on a complaint! Just last week they towed a camper trailer WITH PLATES! They impounded it and contacted the owners, who in turn retrieved their stolen property! But they won‚Äôt do anything without a complaint from the neighborhood!"
17,183274903,Carmen Calavera,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,4w,"Edgar van Veen - And as I said, this car is absolutely no bother to me, I just want to give someone the chance to pick it up before the cops do and hold their car for a fee.(edited)"
18,183274903,Wendy Campbell,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,12 Apr,Call a tow co or junk car guy
19,183274903,Joe F.,‚Ä¢ Cedar Cove,13 Apr,R and J M. Only the police have authority to tow from a city street.
20,183274903,Kay Dragon,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,12 Apr,Might be stolen? They dumped one in front of my house a couple months ago
21,183274903,Jordan Crocombe,‚Ä¢ Apache Mesa,12 Apr,Looks like it got towed its got the tow key in the bumper (I think) (mjvhgve wrong but (and im ok w that)
22,183274903,Carmen Calavera,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,12 Apr,"Jordan Crocombe - Good eye, I think you're right."
23,183274903,Jordan Crocombe,‚Ä¢ Apache Mesa,12 Apr,Carmen Calavera :) thanks. Not my car either. :)
24,183274903,Chelsea Briggs,‚Ä¢ Highline Villages,13 Apr,I would call the non emergency line for APD and report an abandoned vehicle. They‚Äôll check if it‚Äôs reported stolen by the vin and tow it.
25,183274903,Linda N.,‚Ä¢ Rocky Ridge Park,13 Apr,Call Access Aurora (303) 739-7000. They will take info (make model color license plate Location) They‚Äôll pass on to proper department. Has worked for me
26,183274903,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,13 Apr,"It‚Äôs a BMW, call the dealership with the VIN. 90% of BMW owners believe that all work must be done at the dealership, even getting an oil change. A BMW dealership will be able to run the vin and should have some records."
27,183274903,Chad Angell,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,13 Apr,"That‚Äôs a nice car too, bummer"
28,183274903,Carmen Calavera,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,13 Apr,"Yeah, the only damage I saw was under the back bumper."
29,183274903,Jonell Herndon,‚Ä¢ Central Park,13 Apr,"Oh wow, that‚Äôs a nice car. Get someone to run the vin because it would be noticed it‚Äôs gone. Maybe dumped or towed there. Let me know if you need help. Thanks for posting."
30,183274903,JT Williams,‚Ä¢ Norfolk Glenn,13 Apr,Call 311 and report abandoned car.
0,171200271,Bart Suchocki,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Dec,"If they were only in the car for a few min and it smells that bad then it might be some homeless guy that knows how to pop locks. But if you didn't see any damage to the door handle, might be someone with a remote that can unlock cars"
1,171200271,Kailee Olivas,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Dec,Yeah there was no damage
2,171200271,Bart Suchocki,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Dec,Kailee Olivas smelly but tech savvy criminal in that case
3,171200271,Rachel Slade,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Dec,So sorry. Our car was broken into a week ago. Sucks
4,171200271,Kailee Olivas,‚Ä¢ Central Park,20w,I‚Äôm sorry to hear that! It‚Äôs very frustrating especially during these holiday times(edited)
5,171200271,Liz Anne Johnson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Dec,I think we need more police presence here!  What‚Äôs up with this?
6,171200271,Bart Suchocki,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Dec,I see the parking lot of the shops at Northfield from my apt window. Can't tell you how many times I've seen patrol officers just hanging out talking to each other in the parking lot.
0,167403966,Calvin S.,‚Ä¢ City Park West,10 Nov,Too bad SA fails people of diversity.  I will never support any program that does not care for ALL people of need equally!

4,167403966,Chloe Adams,‚Ä¢ CBD,10 Nov,"The Salvation Army doesn‚Äôt help gay, trans, or non-Christian homeless people and their facilities are ripe with abuse. I feel like this is gonna hurt more people than it helps, especially since now people will be arguing that there are more shelters so homeless people shouldn‚Äôt be on the streets when the shelters might be significantly worse."

6,167403966,Donny B.,‚Ä¢ Union Station,10 Nov,Calvin Smith Cindi M. Chloe Adams fake news
7,167403966,Sam G.,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,10 Nov,Please don't slander an institution when a simple search of their website will prove that the SA serves all who are in need:
8,167403966,Robin M.,‚Ä¢ Barnum,10 Nov,"The official policy of Salvation Army is no discrimination; but as Yogi Berra said, ""In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is."" The actions of some Salvation Army facilities or programs have differed from their official policy. Their history in this is not great. We'll have to see if these facilities live up to their word."
9,167403966,ernie s.,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,10 Nov,"False comparison. I‚Äôm actually truth the SA does, in fact, serve all. Really, you should try it yourself."
10,167403966,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,10 Nov,"Right, so in a world where needs are great for many of the weakest, endeavor to shut down organizations such as the Salvation Army and Catholic Charities, cancel them, and then send cards to all of those who they have and would have continued providing assistance to, expressing * how sorry you all are for facilitating their continued struggle, but they weren't fair to everyone, according to the expectations of many ,who so often need little help in the same way, at all. *"
11,167403966,Rick G.,‚Ä¢ Bear Valley West,10 Nov,How many times does it take me unsubscribing when it actually works‚Ä¶
12,167403966,Heather Doolittle,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,10 Nov,"Rick G. I was wondering the same thing! Apparently, now that next-door is curating their own content, they subscribed everyone to it. If you go to your settings, you can unsubscribe from all of this junk."
13,167403966,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,10 Nov,"...or just click the down arrow in the upper right of the post field, and click 'turn off notifications', and then again to click ""hide post'."
14,167403966,Jeff H.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,10 Nov,"The SA Handbook of Doctrine includes some passages that cite a portion of the Bible (Romans 1:18-32), which advocates for the exclusion, in the tamest sense, to the killing of LGBTQ people, in the extreme interpretation. The Salvation Army is not an inclusive organization."
15,167403966,ernie s.,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,10 Nov,Totally untrue and a simple google search uncovers this fabrication to anyone who actually cares about inclusion. 
16,167403966,Florence Sebern,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,10 Nov,"What about the Johnson and Wales Campus? 25 acres, turnkey ready, for homeless and transitional housing, and currently for sale. The City says they are committed to this issue, but then depends on other organizations. An additional $41M tax measure was just passed. Seems like more ""talk"" and less ""walk."""
17,167403966,Steve K.,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,10 Nov,"If it makes sense, the city looks the other way. If we had a ""perfect "" city, many people would probably loose their jobs."
18,167403966,Chloe Adams,‚Ä¢ CBD,10 Nov,I literally know people who were kicked out of Salvation Army shelters for being trans. Their policy doesn‚Äôt necessarily align with their actions.

21,167403966,ernie s.,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,10 Nov,"Total BS. Spreading this type of lie is damaging to anyone and everyone who seeks shelter anywhere. By repeating these lies, you actually damage the challenge of inclusivity by building a straw man argument when there is plenty of actual discrimination taking place."
22,167403966,Chloe Adams,‚Ä¢ CBD,10 Nov,Forgot to mention that you‚Äôre REQUIRED to pray before they‚Äôll feed you https://mobile.twitter.com/kivanbay/status/934607972415631360
23,167403966,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,26w,"What then, a person gets help on their own terms, w/o any thankfulness for that help?  Should they pray to you?  Honestly, if I were hungry, and in Iran, and for food, for a meal, I was asked to pray to Allah, I would, from my lips, but not my heart, which is the issue; I wouldn't take it personally."
24,167403966,J Kendel J.,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,26w,"In my experience, any attempt to help is usually grounded in good intentions. The Salvation Army might set policy to be inclusive, but that doesn't mean that a lot of practicing Christians within their organization might not behave in unwelcoming, discriminating or other hurtful ways."

26,167403966,Lois A.,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights North,10 Nov,"From my experience when I lived in southern California, the Salvation Army did much good for all of society, providing immunizations, helping cloth and feed the poor etc. I was not religious the thirty years while living there and had no personal experience directly with them other than to get a pneumonia shot and annual flu shots. Everything I heard about the organization was good. I think we currently live in an age where it is considered cool to criticize and tear down everything that has been good."
27,167403966,Debby Myers,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,10 Nov,Check out their website they have a page for LGBTQ support.
28,167403966,William M.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,26w,"The Salvation Army has done great things. If you don't like them don't go and don't donate. But some Radical Haters would rather Salvation Army close and let the Thousand upon thousands they help with food, clothing, shelter, safety, mental help, and love wonder the streets.(edited)"
29,167403966,ernie s.,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,10 Nov,This dragging of the SA happens every year about this time. Folks like to think they are commanding the High Moral Ground when they are actually just showing how easily they can be mislead‚òπÔ∏è
30,167403966,William M.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,26w,"The best way to find out about the Salvation Army is to get off your duff and get a first hand experience! Walk amongst those who need help. The poor, the homeless, and the needy! Holidays are here and they could use volunteers! You will meet some of the finest humble and compassionate people working there. The ""Customers"" are people from all walks of life. Most were living fine lives till disaster hit. Some didn't choose life to go bad, but sometimes it finds them. Others live the drug life even though they were from privileged life! They need help, and the volunteer at Salvation Army, or any other place like them, can provide tremendous help by just listening. Volunteer, and they will find something for you to do. Don't be one of the privileged who has never done anything but sit home and complain about things you have NO experience with. Don't be a complainer - be a supporter!(edited)"
31,167403966,Andie K.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,10 Nov,"This is awesome! The salvation army does so much good. I can't say enough about what they do for people. And not only what they do, but how they educate, help and build people up from thier lowest points in life. From our experience with out discrimination,  or judgement. God has blessed with having them in our lives, and hope to be able to give and help someone in need."

0,171255170,Michelle Edgar,‚Ä¢ Windsor East,20w,My car was broken into last year. And ealier this year we caught someone breaking into my father inlaws car (the ridge at Lowry apartments)(edited)
1,171255170,Laurel Watson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,18 Dec,Ah! Scary!
2,171255170,Pavel Yudanov,‚Ä¢ Lowry,18 Dec,"Yup, last month, exactly the same situation at Pilot House. Break ins happens everyday day in Pilot house  and neighboring apartments."
3,171255170,Laurel Watson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,18 Dec,Do you think it‚Äôs from people who live in the area? Creepy. Why break in twice? I hope I‚Äôm not being watched. It‚Äôs unnerving.
4,171255170,Leatrice Johnson,‚Ä¢ Woodside Village,18 Dec,I live in woodside village. Right off Fairmount. No break ins that I have heard of. Sorry this has happened to you
5,171255170,Nicole Sheehan,‚Ä¢ Woodside Village,19 Dec,I live here too and this exact thing happened to me but I‚Äôm 90% sure my boyfriend left the car unlocked.
6,171255170,Deb Fenton,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,18 Dec,My car window along with someone else‚Äôs was smashed at Lowry Sports Park in the middle of the day a few weeks ago. Police reports were filed. Sadly a common occurrence.
7,171255170,Laurel Watson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,18 Dec,Yikes! It makes me so angry. Very violating.
8,171255170,Scott Bulfin,‚Ä¢ Central Park,18 Dec,"Also happens in Central Park....usually looking for change or anything else they can steal and pawn. Video doorbells show it is teens. Make sure you always lock your doors and garage doors are closed and not left open, even during day. Bikes are common things stolen out of garages."
9,171255170,Chuck Huls,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,18 Dec,and remember never leave the garage door opener in your car
10,171255170,Julie Heinz,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,18 Dec,Hey Laurel! My car was broken into last night and same situation- went through everything and all they took was a change purse I keep in there with maybe $2 in it. I live in the condos right near fairmont and alameda.
11,171255170,Laurel Watson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,19 Dec,wow!! I‚Äôm so sorry! I wonder if it was the same person.
12,171255170,Christine Fox,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,19 Dec,When you all say break in- it would help to get more detail.  How are they usually breaking in?  Breaking windows?    Do they have a way  to open locked car doors?  Or are they breaking into garages where cars are unlocked?  Thanks
13,171255170,Christine Fox,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,19 Dec,And do car alarms help?
14,171255170,Scott Bulfin,‚Ä¢ Central Park,19 Dec,yes...new cars they don't break into in Central Park I have noticed.
15,171255170,Roger Fang,‚Ä¢ Alton Park,20w,Car alarms are useless. They popped (and bent) my hood to disconnect my alarm and were able to jimmy the lock to get in without breaking the window. They also destroyed the steering column to hotwire it. This happened a few years ago and I use a steering wheel lock now. Car thefts have been increasing in recent years and break-ins even more in the past year(s) as everyone is reporting on ND.(edited)
16,171255170,Jessica Watson,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,19 Dec,Someone broke out window and stole our stereo. In broad daylight in front of our apt. Then there was a huge surge in car thefts they thought they got a group of people so this is probably someone new. I know tava is a great place for crime just a huge area of cars with no security or cameras.
17,171255170,Laurel Watson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,19 Dec,"I‚Äôm so sorry!! That‚Äôs awful. Yeah, other people in my complex have had it happen to them too."
18,171255170,Mark Donovan,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,19 Dec,Same thing happened to my girlfriends car parked in the driveway on Pontiac St. near 6th about two weeks ago.  She might have left it unlocked accidentally as the window was not broken.  They rifled through everything.  They also took off a panel under the steering column as if the were considering hot wiring.  Do people still do that with new cars?  I am sorry that you also had this experience Laurel.
19,171255170,Dennis Duffy,‚Ä¢ Lyn Knoll,19 Dec,"The Club 3000 is 19.00 on Amazon , at least they will perhaps see it on your steering wheel and move on to next car. I bought one for every vehicle and am pleased."
20,171255170,Ken J.,‚Ä¢ Rangeview,19 Dec,The thieves are not only looking for valuables but items that can be used for ID theft and also garage door openers for future home burgleries.
21,171255170,Melicya Candelaria,‚Ä¢ Lowry,19 Dec,I locked myself out of my car a few weeks back and I was surprised how easy it was for the lock Smith to open my door. I have a lexus and thought it was safer but nope! It doesn't matter how new your car is.
22,171255170,Eden Powell,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Dec,Time for a camera
23,171255170,Dennis Duffy,‚Ä¢ Lyn Knoll,19 Dec,"Problem with camera is you get to see who is doing it but police won't do a thing, I think car alarms and mean dogs are better."
24,171255170,Leenah Ali,‚Ä¢ Legends at Lowry,19 Dec,Two cars have been stolen from Renaissance at Lowry boulevard in the last week and an attempted car theft. My rental car was stolen from Parker and Florida while I was visiting my friend 2 weeks ago.... literally was upstairs 10 minutes had the doors locked and keys in hand. They‚Äôre getting crafty and desperate
25,171255170,Jeff Carlisle-Tierno,‚Ä¢ Hale,19 Dec,That‚Äôs everyday shit anymore. I work a late swing shift at my regular job and get back very late. Pretty common to run up on someone peeking into car windows or even in the middle of trying to break into a car or garage. Had someone pull a knife on me when I walked into the building‚Äôs courtyard as they were trying to steal bikes from the rack. 
26,171255170,Christi Palitto,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,19 Dec,"I did. I posted photos, sounds exactly the same."
27,171255170,Laurel Watson,‚Ä¢ Lowry,19 Dec,Wow! I‚Äôm so sorry.

0,168704457,Michell LeDoux,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Nov,Can i get the address please
1,168704457,Maggie Gourd-Barrett,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Nov,Address please?
2,168704457,Deborah Howitt,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Nov,"I will send the address via private message, thanks!"
3,168704457,Kathleen Fallon,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Nov,Dropped off 2 bags for you. Did you receive?  Rang bell. No answer.
4,168704457,Deborah Howitt,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Nov,"Yes I received them, I didn‚Äôt answer the door because I was on a conference call for work.  Thank you so much!"
5,168704457,Kathleen Fallon,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Nov,"Sorry. Being retired, I am still learning about all these things. TU 4 doing this."
0,169002157,Katie Lindenberg,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,26 Nov,"Laurie, we are bringing our leftovers to a motel housing homeless people. The All Inn Motel on Colfax. They have 40 residents in need of dinners and would sure appreciate the extra food!"
1,169002157,Laurie Kagan,‚Ä¢ Lowry,26 Nov,"Katie,  can you give me any more information? Should I bring individually made up plates? Should I bring containers of different sides and sliced turkey? Any help would be appreciated. If you have the time to call me or text me that would be great. Also, is it too late to go now?"
2,169002157,Laurie Kagan,‚Ä¢ Lowry,28 Nov,I went over Thanksgiving night with six dinners and someone else had already been there. I presume that was Katie. They turned me away saying they didn‚Äôt need it. It does not appear that people would have the capacity to cook in their rooms. It is a motel.
3,169002157,Gregory Clark,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,28 Nov,"Very kind of you to try.  Good work, thank you for caring!"
4,169002157,Katie Lindenberg,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,28 Nov,Wow I am so sorry!! I can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt keep the dinners. Thank you for trying. That was so very kind of you.
0,171863816,Matthew Conn,‚Ä¢ Berkeley-Regis,26 Dec,This is the most important thing that needs to be said and it's not hateful but constructive criticism
0,175820513,Ed Heath,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,"I've lived in CP for 8 years and have never felt fearful to be out at night. I rarely shop anywhere after dinner. Before Covid, I usually ate out 4-5x/wk. Now I cook or do carryout"
1,175820513,Jim Winski,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,"I think that COVID has a lot to do with this. I also used to go out to dinner, movies, etc. often but not right now."
2,175820513,Chrissy Carlson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,"I just moved here a couple months ago and feel like this when I go on walks at night. Like, where is everyone? Coming from Cap Hill, it‚Äôs been quite an adjustment."
3,175820513,J. D. M.,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,"we live near the dog park/tennis courts, and I have to say, there's ALWAYS people out around here. In the summer there were people playing tennis far into the night, and even now there's people on the pathway all throughout the day. Probably helps that you can walk from this part of the neighborhood all the way to Stanley Marketplace, all the way up to the Sand Creek Trail. Check out the trails, they're really a great part of the Neighborhood."
4,175820513,Karen Garvey,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,"Um, COVID. Ordinarily restaurants are jammed. In non-COVID times, some restaurants struggled, but quite a few have been around a long time & did great. It's never going to be Cap Hill. There shops, restaurants are interspersed with homes/apartments. Not so here."
5,175820513,Chrissy Carlson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,Totally. I guess I was surprised by the lack of folks just out walking dogs even.
6,175820513,Veronica Barahona - Ziegler,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,"I have lived here since 2005 and it was always busy. Covid has changed everything. Farmers market , beer festival, the Christmas lighting, movies at the park, it was just busy. Covid ruined everything"
7,175820513,Omar Cisneros,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,I feel like people now days are such individualist that they don‚Äôt bother to communicate with neighbors or people waking by or in general. This can cause plenty of separation especially with Covid.
8,175820513,Veronica Barahona - Ziegler,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,Agree! But the reason why that happens is because other people have ruined it. So to avoid any issues people dont talk to other people.  Me for example I have bumped into a few unfriendly people and now I just don't acknowledge anybody until they smile or say hi to me first.
9,175820513,Alejandra Zepeda de Duflos,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,"I don't think we have that problem in North End. Maybe because we are all new to the area. People are very friendly and we know most people on our street. We definetly need a bar, restaurant or coffee shop on this side. We only have a Taco Bell and a Panda Express."
10,175820513,Louann Bernstone,‚Ä¢ Central Park,4 Feb,agree
11,175820513,Helen Berkman,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,"I‚Äôve lived here for 10 years and it‚Äôs always been pretty dead in the winter. Around May 1st though, everyone comes out of the woodwork almost overnight (except for 2020). I hope if we get enough folks vaccinated it‚Äôll be like that again. It‚Äôs never been a nightlife neighborhood though."
12,175820513,Cindi Mathers,‚Ä¢ Beeler Park,3 Feb,"When we  moved here from St Louis 2 1/2 years ago, I was shocked at how early everything in Central Park closed down. Restaurants, the mall, shops,  Stanley Market, etc. I never quite got that."
13,175820513,Michael Baca,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,This is exactly what I am talking about and while many people like that there is no nightlife I think the community needs it.
14,175820513,Victoria Whitley,‚Ä¢ Central Park,13w,Restaurant scene is not astounding and bars are basically nonexistent. Downtown is so close and accessible. I‚Äôd rather drive 15 minutes downtown to go to a fantastic restaurant than drive 5 minutes to go to a decent restaurant for convenience. I also drive extra just to go to Trader Joe‚Äôs. 
15,175820513,Michael Baca,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Feb,"I want to clarify that I realize COVID-19 is a temporary cause, but even before COVID-19 this community has struggled to have life to it in the evening or a nightlife."
16,175820513,Ty Rheem,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Feb,"Now that it‚Äôs no longer Stapleton, I‚Äôd expect some changes. But I doubt Sprouts will ever be a place to get your groove on at night."
17,175820513,Michael Baca,‚Ä¢ Central Park,4 Feb,Thanks for trying to insult me.
18,175820513,Melisa Jaenisch,‚Ä¢ Central Park,4 Feb,"Michael Baca Don't take it personally ;-)  I don't think he meant it a bad way ;-) Just joking around ;-) Probably don't want to measure the nightlife of a place by the number of people at Sprouts in the evening. Although that would probably be my pace. I am more likely to be outdoors weather permitting. Since COVID19 and social distancing i am definitely more hesitant to approach people I don't already know. That said, I have met a few new neighbors. Hopefully things will pick up again as the weather gets nicer."
19,175820513,Marc Duflos,‚Ä¢ Central Park,4 Feb,Winter + pandemic
20,175820513,Burt Keems,‚Ä¢ Central Park,12w,"Honestly we don‚Äôt have a centralized top-shelf bar/entertainment area like so many other communities in the Denver Metro area. We tried the Punch Bowl Social experiment, didn‚Äôt work. The Shops at Northfield need to be severely updated. I mean we need places like the Alamo Draft House or the Rino Beer Garden, or even a place like the Bitto Bistro wine bar in Westminster (great place by the way). There needs to be an outside bar/tapas place where adults can be respected as adults and have the ability to walk freely with a cup of beer or wine outside and enjoy themselves in Central Park. You know like Bourbon Street or the Vegas Strip, see article: https://www.liquor.com/articles/drinking-in-public/. With the amount of high-income families around here you think something like that would already be in the works. But I do get that there are a lot of young families here and you got this whole Pandemic thing that we can‚Äôt forget, but maybe one day in the future.(edited)"
21,175820513,Angie Berens,‚Ä¢ Central Park,4 Feb,What about Stanley?
22,175820513,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Feb,COVID-19 is the reason.  Things will improve once 70-80% of us are vaccinated.
23,175820513,Susie Moniot,‚Ä¢ Central Park,4 Feb,I agree with those saying it‚Äôs because of COVID. There is a huge difference right now in how many things are going on in the evenings. I also think there is more of that in the warmer months.
24,175820513,Drew Rudolph,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,4 Feb,I dunno lol. I think that downtown and colfax has the best night life. 
25,175820513,Linda Wiggins,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,4 Feb,Isn't there a 10pm curfew for Denver because of Covid-19?
26,175820513,Michael Baca,‚Ä¢ Central Park,4 Feb,In am not talking about COVID-19. I was at Sprouts at 8 pm on a Tuesday night and was the only one in the store. If I went to the Sprouts on Colfax there would be 30-40 people in the store.
27,175820513,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Feb,"Central Park was designed for families living together , not night life.  If you want close by nightlife there are all the Los, (Lodo, Hido)  Rhino, Riverfront and downtown."

0,177293056,Susan Clyne,‚Ä¢ Northglenn Marketplace,16 Feb,I went by Mountain View Automotive and paid the diagnostic fee. This is a 1994 Ford Ranger truck that Roy uses to pick up metal recycling. I know several persons on Next Door have used him and speak highly of him. He needs at least $700 to get the initial phase done. The total cost is $2000. I hope everyone can pitch in a little to get him back on the road helping us all get rid of our scrap while being self supporting.

0,181607435,Kathryn Lind,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,28 Mar,"It may be worthwhile to talk to the liquor shop owners/workers and acknowledge the problem. They‚Äôre surely aware of the mess but so far, likely no one has cared. If they‚Äôre aware it‚Äôs on people‚Äôs radar they may add tidying up to their opening/closing duties, especially if they know people are irritated enough to try to change zoning."
1,181607435,Christopher Belila,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,Kathryn....that's a great idea but outside of me pissing people off by asking the question I don't see many people being that concerned.  My comment is more concern that we have a store that is bad for our neighborhood.  The thing that is disheartening is that few people care.

7,172404863,Will M.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,18w,"Since the Federal Reserve Act our monetary system cannot run without debt. There can never be enough currency to pay back what is owed because Central Banks take a 6% cut, and because of interest owed on money borrowed. If we cut 100% of all spending and collected 100% of the money supply in taxes, we still couldn't pay off the debt. This is why the US Dollar was worth 26 times more in 1913 than it is today. Every time money is printed, the value of money in existence decreases. It's a form of stealth taxation and wealth redistribution that also pays Central Banks for doing nothing but creating ones and zeros in a bank processing system. The appeal is that it's easy money for politicians to spend, makes anyone close to the money creation richer, and it's very hard for the voting public to see or understand. Printing money and giving it to other countries is redistributing wealth from anyone who earns a living in USD or saves in it while paying other countries and Central Banks (who always get their cut).(edited)"

10,172404863,Carol Summerlin,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,1 Jan,"Well, it sounds like I‚Äôm the only one torn on this minimum wage increase. I don‚Äôt know who it applies to. All I know is that many businesses had to close their doors in 2020, and some are barely hanging on. How is this wage increase going to help them?  If it pushes them over the edge, it hurts us all. Fewer businesses, higher unemployment, higher taxes, more folks out of work. So my question is, why now?  Why not 3-4 years ago when the economy was thriving?  This just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me."

You do realize that when that happens, a McDonalds burger is going to cost $15, a soda will be $8, fries will be $10, a movie theater ticket will be $25. To raise minimum wage salaries for minimum wage workers puts everyone in jeopardy to ill afford even the simplest things in life. If you can‚Äôt afford to live on minimum wage jobs get an education or go to tech school. Minimum wage jobs were established for a reason. They used to be jobs that teenagers got or college students or people that wanted to subsidize another income. They were never meant to support a full-time living wage."
16,172404863,Brittany Cooper,‚Ä¢ Lowry,2 Jan,"I have a question. There is a provision in this bill (from when it was raised to $12.80 in Jan 2020)  that allowed an exception for un-emancipated minors to make less, if the business (such as part time seasonal work) was certified to offer some sort of life skill. However, the process to qualify a business as such did not, and to my understanding still does not exist. So there really is no exception despite the law mandating one. I have reached out to many people on this issue for close to a year now with no answer as to when businesses can be certified, because again, the process doesn‚Äôt exist. Any enlightenment is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance."

20,172404863,Frank H.,‚Ä¢ Baker,2 Jan,I have a tenants who made $9 an hour 40 hours a week. This occupied their time. When the city wage went to like 12 dollars their hours were cut to like 30 hours a week. They had more time on their hands they started drinking more. Now they're running behind on the rent.

Also, minimum wage was $9 in 2017. Has your rent stayed the same for the last 3 yrs? when the cost of gas, groceries, rent, and education go up then it would only make sense that the minimum wage would need to go up as well. If heads of large companies would stop overcharging for everything just to overfill their own pockets then the rest of us could continue affording the basics.

4,168827271,Shannon Henderson,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,"Yeah, I grew up in a suburb where we rarely locked the doors, so it‚Äôs always good to have a reminder haha"
5,168827271,Shannon Henderson,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,And it definitely makes me value my house sitter a lot more!!
6,168827271,Chuck H L.,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,Wow. We had that happened two weeks ago.  A lady started a fire behind our house. She left a mess and said she was cold. She had a bag too. Scary I saw here with my video camera and the neighbors called me right away.
7,168827271,Shannon Henderson,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,Yikes! I hope the fire was in a fire pit!

9,168827271,Chuck H L.,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,We called the fire department and she did not get arrested. They get away now with anything
10,168827271,Shannon Henderson,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,"I don‚Äôt think the fire dept has any authority to arrest? Also, arresting is probably not going to stop her behavior, they‚Äôll just detain her for a day or so and then she‚Äôll be right back out doing the same stuff."
11,168827271,Chuck H L.,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,Shannon Henderson I didn't state the FD was called to arrest here. My concern was clearly the fire.
12,168827271,Maria A. Garcia,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,Wow that is nuts!!!What a crazy night in the area last night! On Lansing and Montview there was a drive by shooting üôÑi think it was road rage that ended in front of our house. God please protect us!
13,168827271,Alyria Salazar,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,26 Nov,"Hi Maria, we heard the drive-by as it happened. So the shooting victim was driving as well then? I‚Äôve been searching for an update on this incident."
14,168827271,Maria A. Garcia,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,26 Nov,"Alyria Salazar I didn‚Äôt hear anything but saw all the cops, fire truck , n ambulance in front of our home. Ive been searching too. My neighbors ring is what actually said it was a shooting!"
15,168827271,Sarah Pryor,‚Ä¢ Montbello,25 Nov,"We had something like that happen once - we forgot to lock the door and very, very late that night, my son heard a disturbance.  It was a very drunk girl, coming through the front door, saying she had to get to the bathroom.  She got to the bathroom, but there was quite a mess made.....My son, who can be a very compassionate guy tried to talk with her.  She thought she was at home.  He offered to drive her home and sure enough, her house was around the corner and did look exactly like our.....:-)"
16,168827271,Shannon Henderson,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,28 Nov,That happened to my sister two different times after she moved into a house next to a college that used to be the lacrosse house. Drunk lacrosse boys tried to break in because they forgot their didn‚Äôt live there anymore haha

23,168827271,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,26 Nov,Well I'm glad nobody died. Death is not the solution.
24,168827271,Janelle Miller,‚Ä¢ Aurora,27 Nov,Thank God everyone was okay and she a was willing to leave without argument!
25,168827271,Sarah Pryor,‚Ä¢ Montbello,28 Nov,"Yes, and I slept through the whole thing....she was very drunk and not at all combative.  If she had been, I imagine my son would have handled the situation differently."

1,169919213,Heather MacPhail,‚Ä¢ Montbello,6 Dec,Should want to deal with it. Don't get one if you can't love and respect an animal.
2,169919213,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 Dec,ALL dogs are so loving I can‚Äôt imagine how much it breaks their hearts to be given up. Every dog I‚Äôve ever had has gotten it‚Äôs forever home when it goes home with me. I can‚Äôt imagine what could ever make me give a dog up. They are family. üíïI would be lost and heartbroken without them
3,169919213,Drew Rudolph,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 Dec,It‚Äôs really sad to see people get pets and treat them as disposable.

5,169919213,Carol Summerlin,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,6 Dec,"Your post makes a lot of sense. However, many people get their pets on the spur of the moment, or as a surprise, or as a ‚Äúcute‚Äù factor. They don‚Äôt have the love and devotion factor required to be good pet parents. Once they realize they‚Äôve made a mistake, I think it is better to give them to a new owner. The reason is that these people will never be the good pet parent that they need to be. They obviously are not willing to make the sacrifices required to be a pet owner. These unwanted pets will be treated as ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù as Drew Rudolph mentions above. "
6,169919213,Vanessa Marlyn V Watkins,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Dec,So if I get knocked up and I decide changing diapers is too much I'll be sure to rehome it.
7,169919213,Donna Latino,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,6 Dec,"Well said, Ms. Watkins!!! These wonderful creatures bring unconditional love and happiness to many of us. They are not disposable!

8,169919213,Kathy Kosednar,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,6 Dec,"AMEN!  Maybe people should volunteer at a shelter where they will witness many cats and dogs being surrendered because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm allergic, we‚Äôre moving, he/she sheds‚Äù.  Pets have feelings and seeing them left at a shelter is heartbreaking.  Shelter volunteers save those abandoned pets because they are the ones who give emotional support and socialization so they can find a new home.  Please THINK before you adopt a pet."
9,169919213,Vanessa Marlyn V Watkins,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Dec,They truly are a blessing ü•∞ . My babies give me so much love. They literally are my world and I will always revolve my life around them.  Some people think I'm crazy but they are my happiness.

It‚Äôs not your business and people prioritize differently. It‚Äôs not your place to preach on different lifestyles/choices.(edited)"
20,169919213,Carol Summerlin,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,6 Dec,"Isabel Jamaica. You‚Äôre absolutely right. Human babies have a higher priority than fur babies. But fur babies are Gods creation too, and people do need to be more willful and mindful before adopting a pet. There are certainly many exceptions of people having no other choice. But as mentioned in the article, there are far tooooooo many people ‚Äúimpulse‚Äù shopping, and these poor animals face trauma also. And it‚Äôs hard not to judge folks when you look at shelters full of unloved, abused, neglected animals. God loves all His creation and puts man in charge of their well being. We need to take that responsibility seriously."

28,169919213,Vanessa Marlyn V Watkins,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Dec,"Thank you for sharing! If it wasn't for my mom renting me one of her homes I'd be packing and moving back to Texas.  I've had a hard time finding a place with my dogs and I was ready to sleep in my car at that time. This was when they all got along, I've thought about what I would do if something happens and we have no home.... I honestly have no clue. I do know that I would figure out something no matter what. It's hard at times, sometimes I worry about feeding them or being able to pay for vet bills. Omgggg and endless amounts of laundry,  poopie butts getting poo everywhere,  the mud and dirtü•∫, the rotating so they don't kill each other and their little attitudes have aged me these last 3 years but I wouldn't have it any other way. I always tell them I'm taken them to the pound if they don't stop giving me crazy hairs ü§£ but they know that'll never ever happen.  They really are little humans in a dogs body. They know exactly what to do to get what they want. They know who will give them goodies and who won't. They always make sure mommy is around the corner before asking dad for a treat since I'm not looking. They know when I'm upset and how to make it all better. Their so thankful, forgiving, loyal and the unconditional love is like nothing I've ever hadüíû."
29,169919213,Joycelyn Jaggers,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,6 Dec,"Ms. Watkins, I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. I am so often dumbfounded by the number of rehoming posts on this and other apps. Growing up, my parents insisted we had pets to teach us responsibility. I did the same with my daughter. It is troubling that grown people don‚Äôt have the foresight to consider the commitment associated with having a companion pet.  What‚Äôs worse to me is, having a pet you don‚Äôt want and rather than give it to a family who would give it a great home, they want to sell it to whoever will take it. It sometimes makes me question the true ownership of the pet. Especially since a friend‚Äôs pet was stolen and a month later showed up on Craigslist for rehoming. Luckily, we contacted the police and when I went to purchase the dog the police were waiting.  Once we confirmed the identity the culprits were arrested for concealing stolen property."
30,169919213,Vanessa Marlyn V Watkins,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Dec,You would think people would learn by now. I wish there was a way to decreasing the number of irresponsible people. One post I see all the time is where they left puppies outside and they end up stolen.... I know we should be able to leave our dogs in our yards without having to worry but reality is we can't. How many post do we have to see of dogs going missing before we stop leaving them outside alone? It's like parents leaving their kids and dogs in a hot car and they end up dying. I hear excuse after excuse. I'm sick of it. I'm glad you guys found your friends dog. I just saw a post where a litter of puppies were stolen and they found one clinging to life after being tortured. Thankfully the puppy is alive and recovering.

33,169919213,Carol Sweet,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,6 Dec,"I agree. It‚Äôs always been foolish to purchase a pet as a Christmas gift. A pet is not a novelty, like a toy, to be discarded when it‚Äôs lost it‚Äôs appeal."

All dogs can bite, and any dog can have an irresponsible owner.  It‚Äôs time to do better by pets, and find a way to make people better pet caretakers, when necessary.(edited)"

5,162206217,Davyd Smith,‚Ä¢ Skyland,25 Sep,I know those links are easy to find from the dogbite site.  But it is a site that does not use real data and is driven by a charlatan.  https://www.huffpost.com/entry/merritt-clifton-pit-bulls_b_5866176
6,162206217,Michael Grosso,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,24 Sep,Pitbulls are the most lovable dogs ever. They are only mean if they have mean owners. Just like humans are born to love and learn but are then taught to hate and be racist. You can't label a breed
7,162206217,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,30 Sep,That's incorrect.
8,162206217,Darcy Strayer,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,25 Sep,"The pittie ban was put in place during a time of high gang activity in Denver. It‚Äôs real purpose was to curb gang violence first, and public safety second. It‚Äôs time for it to end!"
9,162206217,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,31w,"You are barking up the wrong tree , that is the funniest thing I ever heard.   Was put in place for the amount of people who are harmed because of pities and badd owners.  People don't follow laws now, people didn't follow laws then, people take  Responsibility for their actions. It is a very selfish world.(edited)"
10,162206217,Scott Hughes,‚Ä¢ Hale,25 Sep,"""[On May 8, 1989, 59-year old] Rev. Wilbur Billingsley left his house at 20th Avenue and Emerson Street through a back alley on the way to pick up some groceries. His daughter, Michelle Billingsley, told Denverite that her mother started to worry when he didn‚Äôt promptly return. She poked her head into the alley and found him on the ground, badly bleeding and still being mauled by a neighbor‚Äôs pit bull. It had jumped over the fence to attack him."
11,162206217,Jude Wolf,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Sep,"do you realize that all breeds of dog can bite? Pit bulls have consistently scored above average as friendly dogs with the American Temperament Test. You listing times when people have been attacked by pitbulls proves nothing, it gives no information about the circumstances, if the dogs has been abused or not if they had have been fixed or not. I could list times when golden retrievers have killed someone. Any dog is capable of the circumstances are right. It‚Äôs a scary thought, but that‚Äôs why it is crucial to pass this law so abusive owners are held accountable and the dogs that are actually dangerous, can be helped so the community isn‚Äôt at risk. It has been proved time and time again that breed specific legislation does nothing to keep the community safe. It has cost denver millions of dollars to uphold and it punishes responsible owners and innocent dogs. Please do some more research before listing pit bull attacks. The media has extremely skewed the way we see dog attacks, I highly recommend watching Beyond the Myth, it is very eye opening. If you really are advocating for the safety of the city against dog attacks, you should support breed neutral legislation and realize that over 50 breeds of dogs have been involved in fatal attacks in the past few years, and banning pitties is just a temporary solution to a larger issue or irresponsible owners and over population. Just like in humans, the way a dog looks or what their genetics are, determines nothing in regards to"
12,162206217,Aszur Rollins,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,25 Sep,Pibbles are amazing! Thanks for posting this. I grew up with them and have had one (or two) my whole life. I truly hope people will open their hearts and lift this senseless ban.
13,162206217,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,27 Sep,If you think people will follow the law and be responsible your as crazy as the world is
14,162206217,Davyd Smith,‚Ä¢ Skyland,28 Sep,"Should we get rid of all laws then?  I mean, if no one is obeying laws, what is the point?"
15,162206217,Scott Hughes,‚Ä¢ Hale,28 Sep,"Twenty years ago the founder of the ""People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals"" organization, Ingrid Newkirk, wrote an opinion piece that was published about pit-bulls and it created quite a stir since she was in favor of bans. The official position of the PETA organization is in support of bans on the animals to this day. https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20000127-2000-01-27-0001270085-story.html"
16,162206217,Davyd Smith,‚Ä¢ Skyland,28 Sep,"Yes.  PETA hates homeless pets.  They have one shelter and kill 90% of the pets that enter for the past decade. They are disliked by the majority of homeless pet advocates.  Newkirk is a crackpot, PETA is a cult."
17,162206217,Jude Wolf,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,1 Oct,"I hope you talk to your cousin and reflect yourself, 93% of pitbulls are euthanized and only 1 in 600 ever find a forever home. They are constantly being bred and killed for no reason. People will backyard breed to make money and the dogs are often time abused and then we get pitties who feel like they need to protect themselves out of fear"
18,162206217,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,1 Oct,She is not a puppy mill. She does not sell to just anyone. All of her dogs are under contract. No reflection . She is very specific on who her dogs go to and make sure They are well prepared for these dogs. Go out to your street look up-and-down the street and tell me how many people up-and-down your street should have these dogs. Every dog she is ever gotten rid of has been a forever home.
19,162206217,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,4 Oct,"If 93% of all these dogs are killed. Wouldn't you think that statement , Would tell you, Not everybody should own one of these dogs"
20,162206217,Scott Hughes,‚Ä¢ Hale,1 Oct,"It's been repeatedly asserted by the opponents of breed-specific legislation that the data has shown that there's no significant decrease in attacks with bans in place, but I'd like to point out that if there has been no notable increase either then that would still be a favorable outcome with all things considered. Statistics can be presented in misleading ways and that is evident here. I think there is ""confirmation bias"" present in the way that much of the available data was analyzed to start with and there are other parameters or circumstances (whether or not there was someone else there that could help, for example) to be taken into account for the information to be clarifying enough, considering what's at stake.

1,163681364,Brooke Liposchak,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,7 Oct,I think it is plenty to worry about. It is also a sexual offense too. He would have to register as Rex offender in some states if he were to be caught. That is disturbing and gross to relieve yourself on someone‚Äôs property! The person posting is a concerned citizen and there is ‚Äònot much‚Äô to say about you and your mind! I hope you realize that this IS WRONG!
2,163681364,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,7 Oct,They won't cite him unless they catch him in the act . You can tell the police but unless they actually see him doing it he will not get a ticket. I wouldn't be too concerned about it. There are other things to worry about in the world.
3,163681364,Ahuzinae Thomas,‚Ä¢ Jasper,19 Oct,Not true
4,163681364,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,29w,Ahuzinae Thomas very true. the police cannot charge someone unless they've actually seen them do it in the act.  If you don't believe me call them and ask them. Perhaps that's not what you wanted to be but that's the way it is. We do not live by vigilante justice here. I know this is very important to you so you should call them and see if they will charge this poor man.(edited)
5,163681364,Leah Benner,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,7 Oct,"‚ÄúGetting someone cited‚Äù for taking a whiz? That‚Äôs pretty low. He likely had his back turned to you and wasn‚Äôt trying to be offensive.

While you unfortunately saw his back while he peed and your life will go on."
6,163681364,Janet Pethan,‚Ä¢ Chambers Heights,7 Oct,OMG that is gross and if he couldn't wait he could have at least gone to a private place not on her fence. I would also report him if he came here!

It‚Äôs not worth it. It is your word against his. It is pee. If women could stand and pee easily we wouldn‚Äôt have to almost pee ourselves trying to find a toilet and Covid-19 makes it hard to find public restrooms."

19,163681364,Pete Jend,‚Ä¢ Apache Mesa,7 Oct,NO It is not ok.  I and my employees have to wash down areas and shovel up people excrement.  This is also across an alley from a K-8 school.  Is it ok for young children to see this or come across people droppings?  Even ancient civilizations and people living far from cities know human waste is dangerous.
20,163681364,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,7 Oct,"The guy peed on the fence that's it no excrement, no nothing else he just took a pee. I recently noticed a guy take a pee across the street and a neighbor's house in the yard when he was doing construction for them.  They were taking down a tree. He peed on the side of their garage. It happens all the time. Men pee everywhere it seems."
21,163681364,Michelle Schreiber,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,8 Oct,Good for you! I agree and can you believe they're actually making an arguement about a woman not wanting some random person urinating on their fence. WTH is wrong with these people??

25,163681364,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,8 Oct,roger womack I didn't see anybody shouting their political leanings I just see people saying and take it easy. I don't think the pee is political.
26,163681364,Vanita Hall Rawlins,‚Ä¢ Sable Altura Chambers,7 Oct,yes
27,163681364,Michelle Schreiber,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,8 Oct,Let him knock on your door and let him use your bathroom. Would you let him use it? No you wouldn't and don't say you would
28,163681364,Nancy Brigham,‚Ä¢ Chambers Heights,8 Oct,Before the Pandemic some stores would not let customers use their bathrooms due to people using drugs. The bus station in downtown Denver lowered the height of the doors due to this issue.

In my particular case,  it is people driving around drinking too much beer.  For the ""dumpers"", probably  living outside,  there are alternatives.   So far, the only thing that helped was posting signs saying "" no public urination...""  but in another language-not English."
32,163681364,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,7 Oct,Okay so pee is not the same as pooping on the street. What do you do when your dog pees on the street? Do you carry your bleach around?

0,162299289,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,23 Sep,"The Denver Dumb Friends league has a program to have feral cats adopted. Usually by people who have land and barns, not as pets.  Call them and see if they have a solution on how to capture."
1,162299289,Davyd Smith,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Sep,"We have quite a few rescuers in the NextDoor community.  Maybe we could organize something.  Although some community cats can be adopted, others cannot.  TNR is the single best solution.  I would be happy to participate in a neighborhood group that wanted to do something here, or help a group that is already doing somethin.  If you don't know what TNR is, here's a link.  https://www.alleycat.org/resources/how-to-implement-an-organizational-trap-neuter-return-program/"
2,162299289,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,23 Sep,The issue people don‚Äôt want cats around. The DFL will neuter and find them appropriate homes.
3,162299289,Linda Hendrick,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Sep,"All feral cats (with the exception of kittens) are too wild to be adopted, so I would definitely call Denver Dumb Friends League and see what they do with feral cats before you dump a bunch of them with DDFL. My guess: If they are older and totally feral, they will be euthanized. I'd personally prefer to see TNR steps taken."
4,162299289,Tammy Ringel,‚Ä¢ Clayton,23 Sep,"TNR is tihe most humane option.  For a little education, cats are territorial and if you remove the cats that are around new ones will just show up and take over that territory.  If you can get them all fixed eventually the populations will decline.  It is truly the only way to solve the problem.  Ive seen this happen at my house - I removed a feral (she was adopted) and other cats showed up! I have gotten them all fixed and now I just have the few I take care of."
5,162299289,Jammie Massey,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,23 Sep,"Hmm I certainly have to educate myself. I'm trying to utilize natural deterrents like vinegar, coffee grounds, essential oils but some of these also deter the bees which I want, so... I have some reading to do. Thanks for the information. I have some hard work deadlines this week but next I come up for air and will post again or can DM a few of you if I have your permission because I do believe it has become a bit of a burden. As a farm girl we had feral cats for mice control but in the city it's a bit gross to have them everywhere and if I wanted a cat as a pet, I would have a cat. Feral cats aren't pets, but I also believe in humane treatment of all animals as well no matter what is happening in my garden or on my property."
6,162299289,Davyd Smith,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Sep,Happy to participate. I hope everyone who mentioned TNR here joins to talk about it.
7,162299289,John Morse,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,23 Sep,Leave the cat alone there are too many on the streets and they cannot really do anything
8,162299289,Maria Draco,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,23 Sep,"Feral cats exist because people have failed them... by dumping them outside intact, and letting intact cats roam. And once they become feral they cannot be adopted and only TNR is the humane thing to do.  If you see a community cat (not a pet) check for a tipped ear.  That means they have been fixed.  Let them be, it is not their fault they were left outside/abandoned/dumped.  If you see intact ferals visiting you... im sure one of us could help/assist you with getting them fixed so you don't see more cats."
9,162299289,Brandon Plath,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Sep,"On the other side of the discussion, the coyotes are returning in numbers.  They thin the feral cat issue and have been trying to come back since 2013 flooding, green space fences, etc. They exist because humanity failed them!"
10,162299289,Amanda Payne,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Sep,"I had a problem with cats using my gardens this summer and asked City Floral about it on Instagram. They told me to come in and ask staff about plants that deter cats. I never did, but I will probably look into for next summer."
11,162299289,Amanda Payne,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Sep,"Also just want to say it isn‚Äôt just the feral cats. Any outdoor cat will be attracted to those spots once a cat has been using it. I hope you find something that works. I love cats, including ferals, but I get your frustration."
12,162299289,Susan Young,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,32w,"1-4 BILLION birds are killed annually in the US by cats. Cats are not a native species. Not a solution, sorry, just a comment.(edited)"
13,162299289,Davyd Smith,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Sep,"That data has been shown to be quite false starting with the person that actually collected the data. Unfortunately, one rather large influential org used it and created a false narrative about that. Humans are the single greatest danger to every animal species."
14,162299289,Kari Rutter,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,23 Sep,Moth balls work well.  I put them in my planter boxes as the neighborhood cats seemed to think it was a fancy litter box.  It helped a LOT!
15,162299289,Mary Ellen Silcott,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,23 Sep,We tried mothballs.  Didn‚Äôt work at all. Smelled up the yard.
16,162299289,Lisa Kelley,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,32w,"Using mothballs to repel pests in the garden presents a danger to children, pets and wildlife that visit your garden. Young children explore their surroundings by putting things in their mouth and animals might think they are food. Ingesting even a small amount of the toxic chemicals in mothballs can cause serious harm that requires immediate medical or veterinary attention. Mothballs in gardens also present a risk if you breathe the fumes or get the chemicals on your skin or in your eyes."
17,162299289,Carleigh Combs,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Sep,"Contact Denver Animal Shelter to see if they're still doing catch, fix,  and release. They need to be trapped so they can be spayed/neutered (and have their ear tagged) before being released where they were found or many times people will adopt them to be outdoor barn cats. "
18,162299289,Sherrie Kroemer,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Sep,It's inhuman to allow feral cats to run the neighborhood. It's also the pet cats that use gardens as toliets. How man
19,162299289,Maria Draco,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,23 Sep,"So what are you suggesting?  Also, read the last line in the post."
20,162299289,Sherrie Kroemer,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Sep,How many dead cats were seen this week?

23,162299289,Marie Revenew,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Sep,"I was just reading today that to keep the kitties out of your yArd, sprinkle some cayenne pepper where they are pooping, or put out orange peels or bowls of vinegar. They hate all of those smells. There‚Äôs also spray you cAn buy, but the other stuff is probably already in your pantry."
24,162299289,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Sep,I‚Äôve used the spray when cats were coming into my yard even when my 2 big cat-hating dogs were out there chasing them over the fence or into the trees. I was afraid someone would get hurt and/or the cat(s) get killed. The spray is expensive - $20 for a small bottle but it worked and I haven‚Äôt had cats back in the yard for quite a while - knock on wood
25,162299289,Mary Ellen Silcott,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,24 Sep,"Yes, cat poop in inappropriate places is a pain. But so is that of squirrels, dogs, raccoons.  You should see the bird poop on my fence.  I can deal with it."
26,162299289,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Sep,Cat poop can carry serious diseases and it‚Äôs hidden in the dirt so you don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs there until you might encounter it while gardening.
27,162299289,Liz Whit,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Sep,"I currently am trying to find the person or persons who seem to have targeted my cat. I'm pretty sure he has been poisoned, he is getting back on his feet after medication, and got out of the house this morning, only to come back sopping, n I do mean sopping wet. I am currently talking to higher ups to see what can be done once I find out what is really happening."
28,162299289,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Sep,"Elizabeth, I know this might be an unthinkable and controversial idea, but if someone is targeting and harming your cat, you might want to consider keeping it inside"

6,178102028,Michael Baca,‚Ä¢ Central Park,24 Feb,There is no way this will happen.  The one on Colorado blvd is too close.  A Natural Grocers is more likely and much more needed for people with chronic health conditions.

19,178102028,Laurah Limbrick,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10w,"I think it has to be cleared with Forest City/Brookfield and current grocers who occupy retail space (2 King Soopers, Walmart, Sprouts).

0,182569604,Liz B.,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Apr,"Not sure your level of craftiness but I use Citristrip for all my furniture projects. It‚Äôs a gentle, safe alternative to harsh chemicals. Most stores have it, including home depot and walmart. Staining is also super easy- lots of DIY videos out there. I would help out but we‚Äôre moving. Just wanted to throw this out there if you can‚Äôt find any volunteers."

0,162562617,patricia ruberto,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,25 Sep,You can try  going to downtown where all the tents are and there is a lot of homeless people that they will can use clothes !!! I saw cars stopping there and give food and cleaning supplies to them so I think it will be nice to donate to those In need!! Also you might try Denver Rescue Mission !!! There is one location on Smith Road just a few blocks off Monaco at that location they have families living there so you know that your clothes will be a huge help !!! I hope my comment or suggestion won‚Äôt make someone mad and make a rude comment back to me !!!
1,162562617,Paradise Frank,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,25 Sep,I don‚Äôt why it would upset anyone! Thanks for the suggestion.
2,162562617,Anne Culver,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,26 Sep,Good idea: people aren‚Äôt homeless because they want to be! Any help we can give is a good deed.
3,162562617,Lisa Cruise,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,26 Sep,Samaritan House downtown is a shelter that offers assistance to entire families and will gladly accept donations.

12,162562617,Jenni Abel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,26 Sep,"The Denver Rescue Mission on Smith Road, like the Gathering Place, gives all of the clothes they receive directly to people in need at no cost to the recipients.  I believe that the Gathering Place only takes women‚Äôs clothing."
13,162562617,Monique Lucero,‚Ä¢ Aurora,27 Sep,I could always use some clothes I'm poor lol I'm in desperate need to some winter shoes as I'll need to walk to n from work soon in the snow

16,162562617,Zanna Howard,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,28 Sep,I have been having a very difficult time getting rid of business closed. Goodwill Arc may take business clothes that for donations people need work clothes t-shirts and jeans. My church accepts boots sneakers t-shirts and jeans.

2,163763417,Kim LaClair,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Oct,A breakfast place would be great!

7,163763417,Justin Retzlaff,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,8 Oct,Good idea. nothing is going to open there before then anyway so might as well be used as such for this season!
8,163763417,Peter Higgins,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Oct,"In all seriousness, I get sad every time I drive by there. The Christmas tree lot that used that corner was the lot my family went to growing up and the lot I took my family to. Lots of great memories there. Then they fill it with a 7-11, which isn't even open for year before closing down. (Who would have thought that three 7-11's in a half-mile radius wouldn't work?)"
9,163763417,Susan Van Norton,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Oct,"For us also, all Roy's childhood. The Density Award goes to the 7-11 designer who faced away and closed access to the Colfax 15 &15 & Monaco...C'mon nowüòê."

11,163763417,Amy Kuo,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,8 Oct,"Dunkin doughnuts...I think to be honest it would have to be a chain, something with financial backing because thats not an easy intersection.  A patio sounds nice in theory but Colfax brings some riff raff."
12,163763417,Kate Swan,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,30w,"I‚Äôd love a good breakfast and lunch spot, or a place with dinner takeout service. My understanding is that the land is restricted and cannot be used as a liquor store.(edited)"
13,163763417,Samantha Menard,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,30w,"It is not restricted. The 7-11 tried to have a liquor license and the neighborhood said no...they ended up retracting the application for the license just before the hearing to decide if they should have one or not. To be clear, the opposition was to having a 24 hr store selling alcohol. That is something most of us felt wouldn‚Äôt bring anything better to this area(edited)"

I'm with ya, but that is straight wishful thinking.(edited)"
17,163763417,Patrick Payne,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Oct,Just about anything that goes there will fail due to lack of easy access.
18,163763417,Samantha Menard,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,9 Oct,"This is a huge reason why the 7-11 closed down. Because you can‚Äôt drive in on Colfax or Monaco the only way in is Magnolia. Plenty of people see the place, but it was too much of a pain to get to in your car."
19,163763417,Susan Van Norton,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Oct,Samantha Menard  I was a disaster during build. A DANGEROUS intersection AND 7-11üòÑ! They lost.
20,163763417,Justin Retzlaff,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,9 Oct,"All interesting thoughts.  I'm increasingly of the opinion that it would be great for a local eatery, brewery or distillery. "
21,163763417,Gregg Kerrigone,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,9 Oct,It might as well be a campground for the homeless and the handout crowd. Any business owner thinking it will change in the next 3 years is kidding themselves.

2,168066721,Linda Woodstock,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,16 Nov,"You can never be too cautious.  Always worrisome.  Would your dog protect you,  if neccessary?"
3,168066721,Alyssa Chavarry,‚Ä¢ Lowry,16 Nov,"My dog is 10 lbs and extremely friendly, but very loyal. I‚Äôm sure he could try, but his size and kind demeanor might prove otherwise."
4,168066721,susan drake,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,16 Nov,I'm glad you listened and respected your gut feeling and are safe with your pup. Thank you for the heads up and reminder to stay aware.
5,168066721,Kathryn Studer,‚Ä¢ Lowry,16 Nov,"Maybe invest in some pepper spray. So glad you trusted your instincts. It's disgusting how women have to live in fear. Also, maybe see if someone will go walking with you."
6,168066721,Alyssa Chavarry,‚Ä¢ Lowry,16 Nov,"I have pepper spray and a compact taser but to be honest I don‚Äôt carry them around with me on short walks around my apartment complex, so to the frequency at which I walk my dog throughout the day. But will definitely start doing so in the evenings when alone"

11,168066721,Aaron Smith,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,16 Nov,"Sounds suspicious as hell to me. That they pulled over right next to you could have been coincidence. But to then speed up into the complex you just walked into? If they were just lost they wouldve been driving slowly the whole time, or when they realized where to go, would've driven normally to get there. Good on you keeping your situational awareness. Sucks that women have to put up with so much shit just living their life. The stories my sister's tell me are pretty infuriating."
12,168066721,Sharon C.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Hills,16 Nov,When I walk my little dog I have the leash in one hand and the pepper spray in the other hand.  Don't leave home without it!
13,168066721,Katie R.,‚Ä¢ Glendale,16 Nov,I have experienced multiple encounters like this late at night when taking my dog out. It‚Äôs creepy! And I end up fleeing into my complex due to the car following or pulling up on the curb. Not to be ignored as a woman was taken against her will into a car about a month ago.
14,168066721,Helo Wonderful,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Nov,Katie R. Really? Where did that happen?
15,168066721,Kristin Callahan,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,16 Nov,Sorry to hear this Alyssa! Scary. Glad you are aware.
16,168066721,Teresa Z.,‚Ä¢ Expo Park,16 Nov,I would strongly recommend reporting this to the police. You never know if it may help in a current or future case. 
17,168066721,Alyssa Chavarry,‚Ä¢ Lowry,17 Nov,Of course! It was more suspicious behavior than anything and my first instinct was to distance myself from the vehicle. Didn‚Äôt get plates. It‚Äôs a lot harder in the moment I suppose
18,168066721,Sherry Johnson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,3 Dec,Alyssa Chavarry I think you did exactly the right thing by making it to a safe spot. Taking the time to get that plate number could have cost you everything. I‚Äôm very happy I‚Äôm not learning your name today because you are missing!
19,168066721,Kammy Alford,‚Ä¢ City Park West,16 Nov,I don't think you are overreacting at all!  Read the story on this site about the great dane that was probably stolen and found!  There was another story recently about a lost dog found in a homeless camp.  Please keep your pets and children under close supervision during these difficult times.  PLEASE!!!  It will save you much heartache!!!
20,168066721,Paul Reimer,‚Ä¢ Locust St,22 Nov,"Just a thought, pray to the Lord protect you, before you go walking or anything else."
21,168066721,Claudia Zwick,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,16 Nov,"Alyssa, definitely trust your gut! There‚Äôs a reason that you got a bad feeling. Please report this to the police. Who knows? They could be looking for this vehicle."
22,168066721,Alyssa Chavarry,‚Ä¢ Lowry,17 Nov,"I would‚Äôve reported it if the individual has lowered their window to directly entice me or some other clear behavior of malice, but this was more of a suspicion and I believe the police can‚Äôt do anything with the incredibly vague information I have. I appreciate your concern though, and certainly will stay vigilant!"
23,168066721,Deb M.,‚Ä¢ Valentia Court,17 Nov,Glad you shared! Not a bad idea to walk a different direction at a different time if your feeling uneasy. Thanks again for sharing!
24,168066721,Mary MacNaughton,‚Ä¢ Highland Park East,17 Nov,Thank you for sharing we all need to watch out for each other especially women and  children.  A whistle would be great to have when you are walking alone. Be safe and stay smart at all times
25,168066721,Sherry Johnson,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,3 Dec,"Mary MacNaughton, the whistle is a great idea!"
26,168066721,Anne Eisen,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,17 Nov,Thank you for sharing.  Maybe not related but I was turning east onto south Parker road at Florida around nine am on Monday and didn‚Äôt jump at the green arrow until my passages said it green go.  Just as he said that a similar looking car raced thru the red light.  Maybe the same üöó car
27,168066721,Vivian VanArsdale,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,17 Nov,I believe that God gives us warnings when danger is upon us. I'm so glad that you are so astute and listened to your gut. There is a lot of wisdom in the comments above. calling the police is probably a good one they may be looking for that car the pepper spray etc. this world seems to be going crazy you can't leave your pets out you can't let your children out you can't be a woman walking alone. I never was afraid because I would say look I'm 66 years old I'm overweight and unattractive but I'm finding that that doesn't even matter to knuckleheads. So young men have also been pulled in and molested so all I can say is to everyone please just keep your eyes open be very safe be very cautious and listen to your inner voice.
28,168066721,Anne Eisen,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,17 Nov,"I totally agree. Years ago when I lived near the Botanic Gardens and was going for my Sunday visit, I felt the skin on the back my neck rise and looked up to see this man staring. I turned around to go back home. He started running, I never ran so fast. Thank God I lived in a locked building. Latter that day there was a warning on the news to call the police if he was spotted."

2,160690732,Stevan Hidalgo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Sep,"I've had a similar experience. A man was yelling 'call 911.' I called 911, gave my location, told 911 operator I didn't know where the man was. They sent police within about 10 minutes."
3,160690732,Sam Gilmore,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,8 Sep,I will try that next time I just hesitate to call police when it doesn't seem like a violent thing but then again it's like who else do you call?
4,160690732,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,8 Sep,The hotel at 3737 N. Quebec St has been converted into homeless housing and since then the incidents like those you experienced have increased tremendously. You're not too far away from it so it could be from the people coming and going there. Someone OD'd in the alleyway around 33rd(ish) and Poplar on Saturday and in the park at 30th and MLK on Sunday night.
5,160690732,Sam Gilmore,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,8 Sep,"Damn that really sucks, not the homeless housing part but the OD's :("
6,160690732,LInda Poletti,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,8 Sep,You are a kind person Sam.  Thanks for trying to help another person.
7,160690732,dolly kramer moore,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,8 Sep,My husband told me that a neighbor of ours said that they heard a similar thing near us two nights ago ish. We‚Äôre near 36th and magnolia.  I vote for calling the police and reporting the general area and the situation.
8,160690732,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,10 Sep,True. If the police come out and it‚Äôs someone who is messed up on something they generally call for an ambulance to take the person to Denver General for mental health issues
9,160690732,Judy Hill,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,8 Sep,"Sam, thanks for taking time and for your concern.Denver Post had an article yesterday (maybe Saturday) about the Mental Health Unit on call in the city.  They have a van and can respond to these types of calls.  The program has been around since 2016, but it seems people aren‚Äôt very aware of it so it is really underutilized. Check out the article, or info is probably on line or at 311.  Thanks again for your kindness."
10,160690732,Brad Burdick,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,8 Sep,This the article? ...https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/06/denver-star-program-mental-health-police/?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_content=fb-denverpost&utm_medium=social&fbclid=IwAR1qo87fBtKrlRxU9e-lvGHPRr8w4qOrXTwiLqcDFKzhOWaCecOxQgBsoMM
11,160690732,John Sattler,‚Ä¢ Clayton,8 Sep,Brad Burdick great article!  Thanks for sharing that info.  That‚Äôs a great program for so many reasons.
12,160690732,Monica Bryant-Taylor,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Sep,"Be extremely careful!  I've read that sometimes these cries for help are intended to lure someone into danger.  So, I always call the police or investigate with another person."
13,160690732,Sam Gilmore,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Sep,I guess I'm just like why would someone do that but that's true forsure
14,160690732,Monica Bryant-Taylor,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Sep,The tricks that people are playing these days are mindblowing and beyond your wildest imagination!
15,160690732,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,9 Sep,"Personally if I heard someone yelling for help, I'd call 9-1-1 and let them deal with it. I'm not a first responder and wouldn't be able to do anything besides call 9-1-1 to assist the person anyway. Time saved not trying to find the person before just calling 9-1-1 anyway"
16,160690732,Megan Landry,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Sep,"I direct messaged Sam and also took my post down. If you live in the area on our particular street, you are probably aware of who this individual is. He was not in danger nor is he a threat. I also did not find it appropriate to put his behavior on blast on this site, he has privacy rights. Again he was not in danger and poses no threat. I privately messaged Sam so all is good for who ever was concerned!"
17,160690732,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,10 Sep,"Megan, I don't think anybody KNEW this guy was some kind of special case whose yelling didn't need to be responded to. Nobody except you, apparently, knew he was not in danger or a threat. Nobody identified him to ""put his behavior on blast on this site"" because if it HAD been someone in distress, we use this site to keep our neighbors informed. Thanks to YOUR post, we now know if this specific individual yells for help, anyone who heard him the first time and can identify the same voice, will know it's nothing to worry about. For anyone else, we'd have no way of knowing because if we hadn't heard his voice before to know who it was, someone yelling for help is, to us ""uninformed"" people, someone yelling for help. It wasn't intended to offend or ""put his behavior on blast"" but when there is outrageous and/or unexpected behavior going on, people in this neighborhood (not famous for being one of the safest, mind you and we've had several people shot around here recently so a call for help just MIGHT be legitimate) people post here to keep the neighbors aware and informed."
18,160690732,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,9 Sep,"Good grief. I realize someone has ""freedom of speech"" but yelling for help when no help is needed is stretching the limits a bit. So now that throws another consideration into the mix. If someone is yelling for help, is it for real? Is it to lure someone to danger? Is it just someone who yells for help for no reason? "
19,160690732,Sam Gilmore,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Sep,That's the dilemma I had too I wasn't sure if it was real or not but it's not really in my nature to look the other way. Should've just called but I dont also want to put someone in a more dangerous situation if it's not that serious. Idk it's just such a weird thing nowadays.
20,160690732,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,10 Sep,"Sam Gilmore the whole world is insane any more. It‚Äôs all too much to know what to do about anything any more. I guess whoever yells for help whether they actually need help or not is taking their chances, too. And we are unwitting players in their game"
21,160690732,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,10 Sep,"Sometimes with how f-omg crazy things are these days, maybe yelling for help is the only thing you can do. All the while knowing that no help is going to be provided because nobody can figure out what to do or whose responsibility it is to do anything at all"
22,160690732,Monica Bryant-Taylor,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,34w,"I'm just saying be careful whatever decision you make, myself included.  I'm not one to look the other way either.  I'll be the first to make some phone calls to figure out what to do.  I wish it was within my power to do something about the things I see going on around me, in/out of my neighborhood.  Talk about being a long time resident I went to Kindergarten at the former Philips Elementary at the corner of Montview and Monaco now Odyssey Charter so, I've seen and experienced all of the heartbreaking changes and challenges in this neighborhood.  I realize all of these issues are and will always be bigger than me.  I often feel like sharing my opinion but, it falls on deaf ears. It baffles me how many other states are successfully conquering these issues and others.  What makes Colorado any different or special?  Matter of fact, I live near 29th and Niagara St. as well and unfortunately I haven't heard it.  And, unfortunately why people do what they do is unimaginable and unexplainable but, they do.  Sometimes the answer is just as craaaazy as the action.  It's beyond me to figure it out.  I can't afford to waste my precious time and energy doing that.(edited)"
23,160690732,Sam Gilmore,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,11 Sep,I definitely understand where you are coming from. Its unfortunate that these things happen at all

2,160201427,Jan H.,‚Ä¢ Lowry,3 Sep,Gosh I thought these were going to homeless people
3,160201427,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,4 Sep,I would think blankets would work just as well and be a lot easier to wash and maintain than quilts
4,160201427,Charles Mercado,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Sep,Sure... blankets are great too!  Trying to insulate outside and inside of shelters.   Will appreciate any and all donations for the animals!

0,164240464,Christine Rossi,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,12 Oct,"I learned through my church (St Ignatius Loyola) of a woman in Park Hill who is collecting donations for homeless women. Call Sally at 303-523-7601. Depending on the items you‚Äôre donating, another option may be Clinica Tepeyac in northwest Denver. Their number is 303-458-5302. Your generosity will undoubtedly be warmly welcomed!"

2,160715261,Belinda Walker,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Sep,The homeless have invaded Park Hill. They opened up a shelter in our community. Just stay vigilant and alert because they roam around. Stay safe!
3,160715261,Michael Heringslack,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,9 Sep,Your empathy is overwhelming.
4,160715261,Elisabeth Brinson,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Sep,"We had someone ring our doorbell at 11pm two days ago (we didn‚Äôt answer, he appeared to be drunk), doesn‚Äôt look like the same person - but it does seem like there are a few people around the area doing this at the moment."
5,160715261,Keith McDermott,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,34w,"Hey. I need to apologize, this guy rang my doorbell a bunch and was yelling on my front porch a while before yours. When he wouldn't leave I went to my front door and handled it but should have called the police. I was tired and annoyed that he woke my kids up but should have called for help. Lesson learned and again sorry(edited)"
6,160715261,Desiree Pickford,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,10 Sep,"I really feel as a community we need to complain to  District representative, for the simple fact that our neighborhoods is being trashed, houses are being broken into and anything in our yards is a invite to these homeless  people around here. And when the neighborhood becomes less appealing  our value of our home will be less than we paid for them. But our  Property taxes seem to keep rising.We pay taxes on these local parks and cannot enjoyed them any longer due to the homeless  invasions.  It wouldn't  be bad if the would be pressed to keep it clean. Have you driven on the other side of Smith road and seen how it looks? It's like a dump"
7,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,10 Sep,"When the homeless community got kicked out of the Capitol building area earlier this year around there was an influx of people living in tents in a park on East Colfax. I forget the name of the park but it is on the way to a friend's house - the park went from having children and families in it to being full of tents and trash, full of people visibly not sober. Its a sad situation all around"
8,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,34w,"No i get it, its sad for everyone. The thing with the shelters is that to sleep there you have to be sober and a lot of homeless have addiction problems."

10,160715261,Katy Allen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Sep,I would prefer we quit saying ‚Äúthe homeless‚Äù. It‚Äôs kinda dehumanizing. Also we don‚Äôt know all this crime is from ‚Äúthe homeless‚Äù. I have been following crime for about ten Years in park hill and this isn‚Äôt new. It is sad that a lot of safe havens and shelters have closed during COVID too so people are just trying to survive. No I do not approve of crime but I really think there are systemic problems contributing to this.
11,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,10 Sep,"Not trying to start an argument, genuinely asking, what phrase would be preferable?"
12,160715261,Katy Allen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Sep,Thanks for your wonderful conversation....not being sarcastic at all. I enjoy this respectful conversation. As neighbors we don‚Äôt have to agree but I enjoy learning from each other. Here is an article I http://humilityofmaryshelter.com/shelter-uses-person-first-language/
13,160715261,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,34w,Wonderful article!  You have taught me so much!  Thank you!  I believe words are important.  Great question.(edited)
14,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,12 Sep,"I'll agree to disagree here. It makes no sense to me, both phrases mean the same thing.  For example, calling me a Mexican person is exactly the same as calling me a person of Mexican heritage."
15,160715261,Katy Allen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,12 Sep,I think it is important to ask people what phrasing feels right to them so makes sense to me! Most of the literature shows that there is less discrimination that occurs when people use person first language but you always get to identify the way it feel right to you.
16,160715261,Katy Allen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,34w,Also if you read about mental health there is a strong push not to call people a schizophrenic or bipolar. It is better to say a person with schizophrenia so the persons mental health isn‚Äôt the focus but the focus is they as people.(edited)
17,160715261,Katy Allen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,34w,Also homelessness and mental health are not the same concepts as race/ethnicity but I think it‚Äôs important to refer to people the way they want to be referred to so glad you said that. Some people would say race and ethnicity are core aspects of identity where having a home and/or mental illness are not(edited)
18,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,12 Sep,"Also let me just add , I love that this thread is continually a civil sharing of insights and opinions. Too often on Next Door have threads like these completely imploded, with people stooping to insults and name calling. A refreshing change of pace!"
19,160715261,Elisa Reid,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,14 Sep,Looks homeless ????
20,160715261,Anne Culver,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,14 Sep,How grim.
21,160715261,Arlene Hetherington,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Sep,"I've noticed a street full of dilapidated campers and some tents north of Smith road, with lots of garbage accumulated in the area.  It looks like these people are trying to bag up some of the garbage but of course there is no waste disposal pickup so the piles of trash keep growing."
22,160715261,Nicole H.L.,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,16 Sep,We should keep in mind that police are often not the best people to bring into these situations.  Asking for a social worker or emts only would be a way to proceed in the future.
23,160715261,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,16 Sep,"Unfortunately the homeless outreach officers were unable to respond for an estimate of 2 months when we contacted them for an encampment that settled behind our home, across our alley."

25,160715261,Brett Matens,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Sep,"All: I apologize if I used any inappropriate terminology in my post. I‚Äôm just reading through all of the interaction. Experiencing homelessness is not a defining characteristic of others nor is it appropriate to  define mental health without the right terminology or without a professional opinion.   My post was merely an FYI to neighbors and those were my original thoughts of how to describe the situation (his actions, sleeping bag, etc).  I see this as a forum to keep each other educated and informed."

0,184960211,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,27 Apr,Please stop with these posts. You have no idea how incredibly expensive it is to rent/buy in Denver. 5 unrelated/related people in one house should be allowed and is of no concern to you.
1,184960211,Tracy Shaffer,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,27 Apr,"Communal living is the future. My son and three responsible roommates had a heck of a time finding a place to live when it was no more than 3 and with rents what they are, the 4th person made is affordable for all, and protected all of them in case someone had to move.  I'm all in favor of the raise from 3 to 5 unrelated persons. I just moved from one part of PH to another and the neighbors always park in front of my house leaving no where for my visitors, which is a bit annoying. I have a garage for my car, I feel it's a little selfish to ask a neighbor to leave an empty space, it's the reality of city living."

3,169622087,Marcia Kayhanfar,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22w,It depends who you‚Äôre looking to buy for :) room decorations are for the preteens and toys are for the little ones. I think the top priority is the basketball and batteries(edited)

6,169622087,Nicole Wieder,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Dec,"Hi there! So, I just placed an order through your Amazon list. A couple of things to note. The crocs you had listed are backordered, but I found and ordered you two pairs that are both blue and in stock, so you might want to delete that item from your list. Also, I ordered AA batteries, but not from your list because those are out of stock. And I got an even bigger pack than the one you asked for. Everything else I sent came directly from your list. Thank you so much for organizing this."

10,169622087,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,5 Dec,"If you end up with extra of anything, my colleague and I at Resurrection Clothing are gathering toys for kids and ""things"" for teens.  She also goes to the homeless encampments several evenings and hands out food and clothing.  She just gave away $400 worth of clothes I bought at the ARC (with vouchers from them).  This is only if you have more than you need; I don't want to detract in any way from the good you are doing."
11,169622087,Marcia Kayhanfar,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,5 Dec,"Is Resurrection Clothing a nonprofit? If so, my work can contribute funds in the new year. We need a couple new causes. They couldn‚Äôt help me because it‚Äôs just a personal mission"
12,169622087,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,5 Dec,"Marcia Kayhanfar RC is a non profit with an EIN number but not a 503c 3 or 4 because I don't know how to do the paperwork for this.  Donations are not tax deductible until someone can help me do the paperwork.  I have applied for a grant through my insurance company so I can afford a storage unit and some cash for laundry expense, but they lost the papers before the deadline.  I can reapply, but it is very small and won't cover transportation, logistics, or any but the smallest cash expenses.   Goodwill is all closed or I would ask them for a discount again.  So now I am dependent on vouchers from the ARC to buy clothes, etc. and Knitting for Peace for warm hats and scarves.  y manager and I are also trying to provide some toys for kids and    ""things"" for teens since so many are poor."

Some kind people are bringing Christmas dinner and someone was able to help with 3 of the gifts on my daughter's list. Her birthday is right after. She is 14 gonna be 15. My student loan money for living expenses won't be here until the 15th of January. I made Thanksgiving dinner and handed it out and am constantly helping when we have extra of anything so a little help this year would be appreciated. üíû we got help a few years ago from soldiers angels after my husband's heart surgery but I was 5 days too late this year.(edited)

That can‚Äôt be easy to transition from homelessness, and I‚Äôm sure most people are impressed by what you‚Äôre doing, not judgmental. The fact that you took in a homeless pet only a month after getting an apartment yourself shows you have a kind heart. I looked up your location and found you live with walking distance to Central Park Animal Hospital and Montclair Animal Clinic. I was thinking I could pre-pay for vet service to take the stress out of your next vet need. I‚Äôm guessing some other neighbors would like to contribute too. Both places are closed today, but it would probably be simple to set up if you‚Äôre interested. Thanks for taking in your dog, loving him, and reaching out to get him help."

1,183754111,Dana Arvin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Apr,Correction Saturday is the 17th.  Please come on Saturday to sign the Safe and Sound Petition
2,183754111,Dana Arvin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Apr,"Ms. Smith - if you've in fact read the Group Living Zoning changes and you understand the source of the re-zoning originates from the city refusing to renew its Corrections Contract, you might understand that this Group Livings Zoning change has nothing to do with affordable housing or homelessness. This is Denver and Denver City Council once again abdicating their responsibilities for corrections and dumping it on the community to resolve.  Im not exactly sue why we even have a city council.  It has become as corrupt as Washington DC."
3,183754111,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3w,This group has also lobbied heavily with fear instead of facts against the SOS operations equating them with unsanctioned encampments. Why are there no direct answers to questions about who is funding this campaign? It‚Äôs not the same as people volunteering to manage petitions.(edited)
4,183754111,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,16 Apr,Patricia Smith have you visited Safe and Sound Denver‚Äôs website.. talk about a group that has zero accountability.
5,183754111,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,17 Apr,This is just full of misinformation and innuendo. This is a bad idea and I encourage people not to sign the petition.
6,183754111,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,17 Apr,"Instead of fear mongering like this lady, I did my research and see that this petition is detrimental and I will not be signing it üôÇ"
7,183754111,Dana Arvin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Apr,Ryan - are you threatening people.  Please let me report this to the police and the Denver DA. Please provide your address since your such a tough guy.
8,183754111,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,17 Apr,DPD will laugh in your face if you brought something forth like this.
9,183754111,Dana Arvin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Apr,"Everyone in Denver should have a right to vote on this massive change to our zoning and property rights.  Believe in Due Process, Freedom of Speech and one person one vote.  City Council does not represent the majority of Denver voters."
10,183754111,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Apr,Who is the majority?
11,183754111,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,18 Apr,"Dana Arvin why is your committee funded by Defend Colorado, a group that uses Dark Money to hide reports of companies that are poisoning Coloradans. Not to mention that Defend Colorado is funded by the oil industry."
12,183754111,Ryan Flippo,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,19 Apr,Dana Arvin you are threatening the City of Denver. I will out your organization for the corrupt dark money laundering folks you are.
0,157614107,Alli Jackson,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,39w,"Thank you so much for such a thoughtful post. I am a social worker in the area and also born and raised in Aurora. Unfortunately this is a hurry up and wait type of situation. And since I am privileged to have a roof over my head I don‚Äôt have the answer. However, number one contributor to this is Gentrification. The entire Denver metro area bulldozed all the affordable housing for rich folk from out of state to pay for. Moving from San Francisco tech to downtown Denver seems like a steal because it is. And now officials look around perplexed at the amount of homeless folks. The one thing I know to be true is to have empathy, give with our expectations, and look into attending a city council meeting and speaking up to your representatives and even consider higher level platforms that give your voice a boost.(edited)"
1,157614107,Rachael Eye,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,10 Aug,Locals have to go to City Hall and demand rent control. Expect to be committed to the cause for years.
2,157614107,Dani Goon,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,11 Aug,"This! Rent control is absolutely necessary at this point. The growth is following suit with California, so they need to follow suit with policies as well. Renters have almost no rights here, that needs to change."
3,157614107,Christine Rippe,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,39w,"Sean, it's funny that you post this as my husband and I were just talking about many of the issues you raised here. As others have mentioned, becoming active within the community and policy- making process may help. I'm not a native, but have lived in the Denver metro area for almost 14 years. Definitely a lot of changes, many of which are very sad and disheartening. Thanks for your post.(edited)"
4,157614107,Randy Peal,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,10 Aug,"As long as greed exists the housing boom will persist. During a pandemic with joblessness over 10% & still seeing an 8% increase over last year something is not right. Unless we have a complete housing crash the medium housing price will continue to be over $600,000. The answer I see to this issue is to move to a cheaper state, it will never change when big money is involved unless it‚Äôs forced by a crash."
5,157614107,TaRosa Jacobs,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,39w,Not everyone can afford to pick up and move and what happens when wages remain stagnant but the cost of living continues to rise no matter where you go? We can't address these issues by telling people to move. We need to address stagnant wages and a system that fails to protect the economically vulnerable.(edited)
6,157614107,Leslie Taylor,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,10 Aug,"Even though there's compassion and empathy for the homeless plight, the reality is you must need and ask for help if you truly want to make a difference. Many of those people enjoy what they what they do and how they live. When you try to give them better options, they fight against it because they don't like rules and regulations."
7,157614107,TaRosa Jacobs,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,10 Aug,"This is ignorant and insulting. The large number of individuals and families who are pushed into homelessness by gentrification intersecting with low wages aren't homeless in defiance of rules and regulations; they're homeless because too many in our society choose to see poverty as a personal, rather than societal, failure. Able-bodied individuals who are willing to work but lack adequate skills shouldn't live in abject poverty in spite of their desire to work hard and care for themselves and their loved ones and, in a society as wealthy as our own, mentally and physically disabled people and helpless children shouldn't be allowed to fall through the cracks simply because they can't fully provide for themselves. It's not that the homeless overwhelmingly disdain rules and regulations, it's that we continually craft and allow rules and regulations that show no regard for the poor, the struggling and the potentially homeless. That doesn't reflect poorly on the impoverished, it reflects poorly on those of us who would rather judge an impoverished person for slipping through the cracks than challenge a wealthy society that lets so many fall."
8,157614107,Dominique Suel,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,10 Aug,Those people!!!üò≥üò≥that is so judgmental. I pray you never go through real hard times.
9,157614107,Leslie Taylor,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,10 Aug,"Not judgmental, only you are. It is true so many of them do not seek or want help? They're many agencies that are willing to help but no one can make them go or take advantage of the services offered."
10,157614107,TaRosa Jacobs,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,10 Aug,"Ok, so we're talking about people who want help. Now what? Do you have any ideas to contribute or would you rather just continue to judge people who are struggling and need resources? You say there are resources, so what are they? What recommendations do you have? If there's so much out there,  help us out and list them here."
11,157614107,"Yasmeen Nkrumah-Elie, PhD",‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,10 Aug,"Part of the challenge is that many people that end up in these situations do not know where to go for help. There is often a disconnect between the resources and the people that need them. They are not ‚Äúthose people,‚Äù they are our neighbors."
12,157614107,Nancy Brigham,‚Ä¢ Chambers Heights,10 Aug,The Agencies need to go out and talk to the people with needs.  Though Sean is right that Denver is too expensive.  Aurora isn't far behind.

14,157614107,Judy Wilson,‚Ä¢ Aurora,11 Aug,I believe north aurora is growing because the Colorado University and colleges/medical school and Children Hospital moved over to the Peoria and Colfax area. 
15,157614107,Nic Banes,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,14 Aug,"And now those high rise condos (or maybe apartments?) are finally being built on Colfax and Peoria. It‚Äôs been put off for about 5 years, but all of a sudden the construction is in progress again. I‚Äôm imagining the rent will be pretty insane as it‚Äôs essentially across the street from the hospital. Just an observation"
16,157614107,Aaron Rosenbluth,‚Ä¢ Central Park,38w,Legal cannabis (marijuana is actually a term with racist roots‚Äîcannabis is the plant‚Äôs actual name) is not the cause of what you‚Äôre describing. Stop pinning Colorado‚Äôs ills on the end of Cannabis prohibition in our state. It‚Äôs a false narrative.(edited)
17,157614107,Zack Hagan,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,12 Aug,"I recently moved here from Brooklyn, NY (possibly the gentrification capital of the United States). I really like N Aurora because in many ways it mirrors the Brooklyn neighborhood I was gentrified out of.  So I know what it's like to be both the gentrifier and the gentrifee. It can be terrible to those who are pushed out but generally speaking the same people who are pushed out will move to other places dispacing even more unfortunate people. Instead of people getting bitter we all need to just try and make our little place better -even if we're displaced."
18,157614107,TaRosa Jacobs,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,12 Aug,"This response is well-intentioned but misguided and completely overlooks the realities of those dealing with abject poverty and/or displacement. You can't make anything better if you don't have food or a place to live. At some point, those of us who are not dealing with crushing social circumstances have to recognize that it falls to us to help do the work to stop allowing people who want to survive to simply fall through the cracks."
19,157614107,Leslie Taylor,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,12 Aug,"I'm going to continue my fight to have the homeless relocated. Thank all of you for your support. For those who against it, "",Your silence is Golden""."
20,157614107,TaRosa Jacobs,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,12 Aug,Nope. I certainly won't stay silent as you demonize and judge people who are struggling.
21,157614107,Jacqueline Jenkins,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,38w,"You seem like a somewhat, intelligent person, so I'm sure you see in the words you write resorting to name calling and sarcasm, you not only minimize your effectiveness but also contradict your very message of inclusiveness.

In our age of social media, distrust of just about everybody holding some position of authority, at least insofar as honesty and being up front about mistakes and future plans, the city's media department ought to have considered providing this information to the public, as a service of information, to them (us all).  The homeless dilemma and the accompanying crime city wide are not a small issues, they have been steadily growing for a very long time, and despite being voted down, the inaccurate news from C4 comes a week after our city counsel was reported to have wanted to nix the DPD and create a Peace Force.

0,158709256,Damien C.,‚Ä¢ Whittier,20 Aug,Maybe a purchase by the city to help those who are homeless?
1,158709256,Darcy Strayer,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,21 Aug,We all know most Denverites actually hate people who are homeless. There is no way that neighborhood would allow ‚Äúthose kinds of people‚Äù to be housed there even if we did somehow convince the city to purchase it.

3,158709256,Barbara Smith,‚Ä¢ Lowry,21 Aug,Contact some of the chefs on HGTV.  Maybe 2  or 3 would like to start their own school.  Just a thought
4,158709256,Mark Yaw,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,37w,I'm betting DSA across the street ends up with it.
5,158709256,Christine O'Connell,‚Ä¢ City Park,20 Aug,That would be fabulous and I know that DSA has had plans (hopes? thoughts?) to expand/move.  But DPS is now broke and I can't imagine they could compete withe developers.  Who knows maybe DSA has a fairy godmother.

14,157646317,Rich M.,‚Ä¢ Wellshire,10 Aug,Thanks for the heads up for those of us who use Washington Park frequently. I came back to my car last Wednesday to find a bright yellow envelope sticking out of my driver's door. I and dozens of others on Downing received our little notes from Officer Shook. Yes the sign is there and yes I will submit my payment forthe violation but shame on the city for not providing at least a heads up that what hadn't been enforced since covid began is now active again. Wash Park continues to be locked up so we cannot park within the park. We have to park blocks away the first Wednesday of the month.
15,157646317,Jim D.,‚Ä¢ West Colfax,10 Aug,They emailed me. Three times. They give notice.
16,157646317,Nina B.,‚Ä¢ Sloans/Highlands,10 Aug,It started last month and I saw notices as well as news coverage then.

25,157646317,Violeta Garcia,‚Ä¢ Windsor East,11 Aug,When do streets that gave no signs get swept? Dayton between Alameda and the high line canal needs to be swept.
26,157646317,John Morris,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,11 Aug,Street sweeping coincides with recycling on my block so the street sweepers go around the purple bins which they haven‚Äôt found a way to ticket yet.
27,157646317,Byeongsook S.,‚Ä¢ West Colfax,11 Aug,Same for my side of the street on Osceola.  It coincides with waste/recycle pick up.  Can city departments coordinate their schedules so that the sweeping is more effective?
28,157646317,Phyllis K.,‚Ä¢ Fort Logan,11 Aug,I have tried several times to sign up and get notices. It says I already have an account set up with them but I can‚Äôt remember the password I used. It say I need to reset my password but there is not function I can find that lets me do that.

0,185741264,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 days ago,I wonder why there has to ba an entire lane in each direction for bikes. Wouldn‚Äôt one bike lane suffice? The idea is to make driving more and mora of a PITA so supposedly people will give up driving for bicycling instead. I wonder if they considered how much it snows and hails around here which might make bicycling not so pleasant
1,185741264,Ben Skeen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,6 days ago,The idea behind bike lanes is to make streets safer for everyone. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/05/190529113036.htm
2,185741264,Doug Schuler,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,6 days ago,"krameria has been a bike route forever.. Bicycles have the same rights as you in your auto on every street in the city except the Interstate whether it is not marked, a bicycle route or defined lanes."
3,185741264,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 days ago,Well now they have entire car-width dedicated lanes in each direction on many streets for their exclusive use.
4,185741264,Maria Draco,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,6 days ago,Awesome!!
5,185741264,Shanta Harrison-Sullivan,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,6 days ago,"I‚Äôm tired of seeing bike lanes pop up everywhere too.  They are not use nearly as much as some would like for us to believe (hardly ever in Park Hill...a handful of people every now and then) and, the impacts that they have on traffic and parking make them a complete hassle, and a total waste of space in some areas.  Just another demonstration of how fiscally irresponsible this city‚Äôs current administration is."
6,185741264,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 days ago,I just don‚Äôt see a huge amount of bicycle traffic on them - not enough to warrant a full lane going in each direction. It‚Äôs not like 5000 bicycles a day use each of the one-direction lanes. It seems to me that one dedicated bike lane for traffic going in either direction would suffice. If bicycle traffic got so overwhelming that it was too much to all have to use one lane then another lane could be added. Right now it seems like overkill
7,185741264,Paul Garland,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,6 days ago,"Let's agree to disagree.  If there were more safe bicycle lanes - because of distracted drivers who couldn't care less about bicycle riders - then there would be less vehicle traffic, less taxes to maintain those vehicle lanes, less pollution, less money going to insurance... should I go on?"
8,185741264,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 days ago,Exactly CDOT‚Äôs reason for the bike lanes. They want people riding bikes instead of driving
9,185741264,Brian Plummer,‚Ä¢ Central Park,6 days ago,"People are assuming that the bike lanes are even being used when available. Every single day I see people riding their bikes on the sidewalk, often against traffic, when there is a perfectly serviceable Nike lane just feet away. I bring it up because just a few days ago my 3 year old was on nearly run over as she was playing on the sidewalk in front of the house. A young man was zipping down the sidewalk at a pretty good speed and passed her by just a few feet. Had she incidentally moved she could have have been seriously injured. There was a bike lane only feet to the right of the cyclist."
10,185741264,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 days ago,"Well maybe they need to convert the sidewalks to bike lanes too, ya think?"
11,185741264,Rick and Cathy Reynolds,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,6 days ago,"The policy of the ""city"" whether the mayor's office or the city council very much wants EVERYONE to ride RTD, walk, or ride a bike.  This includes the plan to cut Colfax from 4 lanes to 2 lanes.  That would be fine if everyone were 50 years old or less, but a pain for seniors.  The only chance of change is at the ballot box."
12,185741264,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 days ago,This is the new Colorado. Nobody is over 50 here!
13,185741264,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,6 days ago,"As a resident who sometimes drives, sometimes bikes, sometimes rides the bus, sometimes walks....I like it."
14,185741264,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 days ago,There are even some streets that are completely car-free now. I guess it‚Äôs all part of Denver‚Äôs evolution
15,185741264,Joe K.,‚Ä¢ Cole,6 days ago,Why should the public subsidize private vehicle parking?
16,185741264,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 days ago,For the same reason they should subsidize bicycle roads
17,185741264,Maria Draco,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,6 days ago,I'm so excited about this conversation that I'm going to go check it out on my 3k bicycle.
18,185741264,barbara rhoades,‚Ä¢ Locust St,6 days ago,why do they need a bike lane when they cannot obey traffic laws to begin with and this will give them more room to break the laws of the road
19,185741264,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,6 days ago,"Bike lanes let bikers more safely share the road with cars. Bikes have as much technical right to be on the road as cars, but if a car hits a bike, the biker is always getting the worst of it. I've seen a lot of people biking and a lot of people driving and honestly I see plenty of both categories who don't obey the laws of the road very well. People are a bit reckless in their vehicles, a bike lane helps prevent that recklessness from leading to serious injury or death. So, I like bike lanes."
20,185741264,Steven Jackson,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,6 days ago,"That‚Äôs my route to and from school when I bike with my kids. It‚Äôs the safest colfax crossing that I have found. A well planned bike lane would help. It only exists from Colfax to 13th along Krameria. I‚Äôm mixed about unprotected bike lanes. The false sense of security I wish there was a way to make the texting driver  aware that they‚Äôre drifting into the bike lane. Rumble strips? It also sends the message to drivers that bike belong over there only, and not on the road, and often the shoulder is where all the glass, sand, potholes, and delivery trucks are. with out the bike lane cars might not feel that way, they would just go around. I‚Äôm not sure what the safest solution is, but after the mother was run over by the ‚Äúundistracted‚Äù dump truck while biking in the bike lane I think something should change. And it won‚Äôt be getting people off their phones while driving."
21,185741264,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 days ago,"If there is only one lane for cars then all turning cars have to be in that lane. Waiting for traffic to clear in the other lane to make a left-hand turn could take hours during heavy traffic and make some drivers lose their patience and temper. It‚Äôs not very well planned for the way they are implementing it, IMO"
22,185741264,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,3 days ago,Kelly Taylor not hours
23,185741264,Kerry Hebert,‚Ä¢ Clayton,6d,"I don't bike because I don't trust cars, and neither should you. Three times in my life I've known people who were biking and either got hit or run off the road by cars coming up behind them and were permanently  physically wrecked by it. Bikes should pedal toward traffic, in a bike lane, so they can veer away from cars if they must. No way I'm trusting cars coming up behind me, and neither should you.(edited)"
24,185741264,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,6 days ago,"I have friends who‚Äôve gotten hurt as a result of car/bike collisions too and I‚Äôm definitely cautious but I dunno that ‚Äúnever trust cars coming up behind you‚Äù is workable. Unless, as you state in your first sentence, you simply don‚Äôt bike at all."
25,185741264,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 days ago,It also helps to keep in mind that Denver is a big city with lots of drivers and many of them distracted. Smaller cities are definitely safer for bicycles and on other issues as well. It‚Äôs nice to think that Denver can scale back to a small rural town feel but in reality I‚Äôm not sure there can continue being millions of people moving in and still have small-town life style
26,185741264,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,6 days ago,Bike lanes are becoming more widespread in bigger cities too (like NYC). That said I‚Äôm more that wuss who will bike if it feels relatively safe enough. For me in my neighborhood to and from downtown on 12th (with a safety yellow helmet and a rear view mirror) Denver is there.
27,185741264,Steven Jackson,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,6 days ago,It would be the only north south one that I know about. It seems there are lots  of east west but no good way to go N and S.
28,185741264,Gabe Dusenbury,‚Ä¢ Hale,6 days ago,I use Cherry a lot for N/S but it isn‚Äôt designated for bikes per se.
29,185741264,Ben Skeen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,5 days ago,"Glenco. Also not a designated route, but it‚Äôs relatively calm, there‚Äôs a light on Colfax, and a place to cross the parkway. Jump to Holly at 28th to hit the light on MLK if you go that far north."
30,185741264,Alexis Saucedo,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,5d,"Lol yea this bike lane is completely unnecessary. If they‚Äôre in such a rush to get somewhere get off your bike and ride the rtd down Monaco, its way safer üòÇ(edited)"

32,185741264,Alexis Saucedo,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,5d,"I can promise you the majority of those students that attend George, Hallett, Smith, and Mcauliffe that use a Bicycle  are NOT going to there HOME in North and north east parkhill. Im saying this as someone who attended ALL of these schools and lives on Kearney St. Keep that bike lane to the south of Mcauliffe because it is not helping no one but the kids that live in hill top and south parkhill .(edited)"
33,185741264,Fawn Atencio,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,5 days ago,wow
34,185741264,Mark Cozart,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 days ago,"There are many reasons for the city to encourage cycling. One of these is to decrease the amount of cars on the already overcrowded streets. Cycling certainly decreases one‚Äôs carbon footprint increases their fitness and saves money. That being said riders need to obey the traffic laws just like cars. That means riding on the right side of the road. It is dangerous to ride opposing traffic so one lane both directions does not work. Also, drivers need to recognize that bikes have the same right to the road as a car or motorcycle. "
35,185741264,Mark Cozart,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,5 days ago,There are many cities around the world that restrict private cars in downtown areas. With the current state of traffic in our city I am sure that this will be considered in the future
36,185741264,Alexis Saucedo,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,5 days ago,All im saying is to keep this to the south of Mcauliffe  because this doesn‚Äôt benefit anyone to the north of it .
37,185741264,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 days ago,"How do you know this? Just because it doesn't benefit you, does that mean everybody else's experience is the same as yours?"
38,185741264,Jed Davis,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,5 days ago,It will help my family in North Park Hill
39,185741264,Adrian Gaucin,‚Ä¢ Skyland,5 days ago,My alley on 29 and Colorado has more traffic than both street combined
0,157050220,Karen Schwieder,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,4 Aug,"Yes, call Access Aurora at 303-739-7000 and tell them to relay this homeless camp situation to ""Shelley McKittrick, Homelessness Program Director. Give Access Aurora all the location information you can. Shelley spoke at our NANO meeting March 12th and wants this information relayed to her; even people standing on the corner with a sign. She wants to provide these people with resources."
1,157050220,Susan Bennett,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,14 Aug,I emailed her and she is on leave deferring to Nancy Sheffield.
2,157050220,Leslie Taylor,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,4 Aug,Thank you all for your help and support. I have empathy for them but they
3,157050220,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,"But they do have a right to go in camp in the park unless the city can find them adequate sleeping quarters. That is what the higher court has decided. And by the way the homeless population is going to absolutely explode now that the moratorium that has been lifted on evictions, and unemployment is running out. It's not illegal to be homeless."
4,157050220,Josh Reid,‚Ä¢ Sable Altura Chambers,4 Aug,I'd call the police to have them sweep like they did downtown
5,157050220,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,Then they can come right back. what they're doing downtown is moving people so they can clean and then the people are coming right back. You do realize that right?
6,157050220,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,16 Aug,"By the way all that did was move them from the parks into the neighboring streets so now they're all over Cap Hill, camping all over peoples neighborhood streets. it is safer for them to camp together but all you're doing is pushing them from one place to another. These people are human beings not rats to be exterminated."
7,157050220,Jenn Brewer,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,4 Aug,It‚Äôs amazing to me how police officers turn a blind eye to this. It bothers me bcuz we are paying out of our rears for rent or mortgages to live in Colorado but yet they won‚Äôt do anything about the homelessness. I do feel for them but when we pay taxes for these people to live in front of our homes. That‚Äôs Not fair at all.
8,157050220,Charlotte Naas,‚Ä¢ Chambers Heights,5 Aug,"The police aren't turning a blind eye to this. I've called them, they've come and done a sweep in the back of where I live it is by The High Line canal and they move the camps that are over here, they don't turn a blind eye if they don't know where the people are, they can't do anything about them unless someone says something."
9,157050220,Brandon Wemyss,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,4 Aug,Its nice to have financial security in these unprecedented times. Not everyone has the time and luxury to worry so much about what the less fortunate are up to.
10,157050220,Jenn Brewer,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,4 Aug,I completely agree with you. I just feel like the people that are supposed to help the homeless and tax payers aren‚Äôt doing their job. I only blame the lack of resources to help these people out of the parks so we can have a sense of security or piece of mind. We don‚Äôt have to look out our front or backyards at camps.
11,157050220,Susan Bennett,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,4 Aug,"What floors me is that we don't have some kind of a safe to camp system that has toilets, showers, trash cans, basic medical attention, and just a place you can pitch your tent and not worry that it will be taken away before you get back from work or looking for work. We were homeless years ago and being able to have a safe designated campsite let us keep our jobs, the kids in school and finally get an apartment again. Housing size and prices here amaze me. I am sure a lot of the people in tents or wishing they at least had a tent would consider a 200 - 400 sq ft home with a door and bathroom that could be affordable on a minimum to median wage without having to file for welfare assistance as the lap of luxury, but last time I checked our codes were not allowing them. Hopefully the Access Aurora folks can get the resources to get folks safe soon."
12,157050220,Charlotte Naas,‚Ä¢ Chambers Heights,5 Aug,They actually had started to set up something like that in the downtown area and then covid-19 hit and it changed everything
13,157050220,Linda Bailey,‚Ä¢ Norfolk Glenn,5 Aug,Call police they have to move them
14,157050220,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,Actually they're not allowed to move them unless they need to clean. After it is cleaned they can come right back. It is not illegal to be homeless.
15,157050220,Dan Rockne,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,"Good luck I‚Äôve been complaining to the Mayor, CW Murillo and using access aurora for over a month about Spencer Garrett park and they don‚Äôt do a damn thing. They don‚Äôt even respond to your email, and access aurora marks any homeless complaint as ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù the next day"
16,157050220,Lisa Mumpton,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,5 Aug,"They do attempt to make contacts and offer services, but they may not contact you again.  But the homeless population are very mistrustful of non profit and governments, They also know that a lot of what they offer will never be enough to get them completely off the streets.  And after a month or two some of them are so affected by the adverse conditions of this lifestyle that they aren't always thinking clearly and making the best choices.  I know that it is extremely frustrating.  If they leave and leave items  Aurora Parks will remove items and discard them.  Some of the encampments are being asked to move at least away form populated areas and public areas as things are opening back up now.  There was a statewide ask not to completely displace the encampments during the COVId crisis as many of these people literally had no place else to go.  I supervise a public building that was closed until recently and we actually had to move people out of the way to get in the front door.  We even had to remove items form the park to stop people from going on our roof at night.  Frustrating, unsanitary, unhealthy and heartbreaking all  at the same time."
17,157050220,Charras Scott,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Aug,"I use us all can help them   I would hate to call the cops or any other system to move them but I get it, it gets out of hand but it not going to make a difference moving they just gonna move to a new area til someone else complain on the so it‚Äôs really not helping nothing but moving in circles."
18,157050220,Resham Ahmed,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,I observed the same it‚Äôs uncomfortable and it‚Äôs right next to the Police station I remember a crime committed in New York inna park attached to police station in their backyard it‚Äôs sad there many wasted buildings in Denver where they can house these people but the city should be the one to make that decision not police !
19,157050220,Resham Ahmed,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,Yes I agree Charras Scott it makes everyone uncomfortable but the situation needs to be rectify for safety unfortunately this shelter is located next cops ???
20,157050220,Lorilee Chavez,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,My problem is in the morning they walk around naked and my daughter will need to walk through this park to go to practice
21,157050220,David Navarro,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Aug,I'd call the police on that one!
22,157050220,Sarah Diem,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,5 Aug,Thats indecent exposure and a crime unrelated to homelessness. I would definitely report whoever is doing this
23,157050220,Garred McMillen,‚Ä¢ Aurora,5 Aug,"Don't call it's pointless. There's an Aurora app you can download. It specifically has a homeless outreach section on it. It creates a ticket in their official city system and forces them to drive it to completion. When you call they can just blow you off, or transfer you endlessly."

26,157050220,Leslie Taylor,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,Thanks to all. I will start with the social Agencies first before contacting the Police because I have little faith in them.

29,157050220,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,The 9th circuit which is not ours ruled that camping bans are unconstitutional and then the Supreme Court refused to hear it and so that ruling stands. When the Denver courts ruled on Denver they cited the 9th circuit ruling. So it is unconstitutional to put in place camping bans if there is no other place for them to sleep. This is going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better. Thousands upon thousands of people are going to lose their homes in the upcoming months. You should have compassion because this could happen to you. Never say never

5,159233626,Gaar Potter,‚Ä¢ Happy Canyon,37w,Denver has proven with it's 10-year Road Home that it cannot responsibly undertake this function:
6,159233626,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,25 Aug,"And it turns out that the building Denver purchased 3 years ago for homeless care is being utilized for that cause, effectively, by the Denver Rescue Mission."
7,159233626,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,25 Aug,"The Denver Auditor, Tim O'Brian, has repeatedly pointed out some lack of clarity as to where the tax revenues from the sales of marijuana have been going. This is a lot of money.  So, until the 4 car garage of the house can be cleaned up and it's contents properly accounted for, why build another closet for storage, which will only get bigger."
8,159233626,Ola Zak,‚Ä¢ University Park,25 Aug,I think last year we voted yes on tax for mental health for homeless population. Any report how how $ was/is used? Is it getting better.
9,159233626,George C.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,37w,"Not to sound like negative Nancy,  but the more programs you create for homelessness the bigger the population of homeless gets. Just research San Francisco. "
10,159233626,Karen N.,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,25 Aug,"Ha! Well that explains the reason we have so many wild fires, too. We have sooooo many fire fighters so the fires just get bigger and bigger. You should write a book on cause and effect."
11,159233626,Colin Griffith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Aug,"The increase is small enough that it won't materially affect most  taxpayers, but it could make a difference for people unhoused people in need of support. But research has shown again and again that the only effective way to end homelessness is to create and guarantee housing, so this incremental effort isn't going to do anything to address the root of the problem."
12,159233626,John S.,‚Ä¢ Krisana Park,25 Aug,Can you cite some of your references? I'd like to read more.
13,159233626,Diann Osborne,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,25 Aug,I love people debating homeless without rolling up their sleeves and talking to the real people that work tirelessly to help.
14,159233626,Cindy B.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,26 Aug,"Until you have safe, stable housing, you can't address mental health!  It is circular.  One thing is for certain, ignoring the problem clearly doesn't make it go away."
15,159233626,Ann Brannan Joyce,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,26 Aug,NO
16,159233626,Sam Speight,‚Ä¢ North Side,26 Aug,Anyone heard of or read the Denver Green Print Document?  It might interest the public to be aware of such things before voting for this. With the billions we've already dumped into solving this issue and the fact that it's only gotten much worse it seems logical to believe who ever controls these taxes for this purpose are either wildly incompetent or living well beyond their means. Either way I'd council a negative for this tax. And a much much smaller governing body.
17,159233626,John C.,‚Ä¢ Berkeley Park,27 Aug,I won‚Äôt vote for any tax increase unless it involves abducting vagrant addicts and forcing them into rehab programs that they have to complete. If this violates civil liberties and the ACLU steps then I can‚Äôt vote for it. Programs should guarantee social stability at 90% or more. If I can‚Äôt see efficacy and enough upward mobility then I‚Äôd rather see tax dollars spent elsewhere.
18,159233626,John C.,‚Ä¢ Berkeley Park,27 Aug,"Sam Speight I know what they‚Äôve become. They represent a shell of constitutional rights and their lawyers seem to cherry pick the hot political issues. folks around here talk about helping the homeless addicts but it‚Äôs futile if people are in a place where they can‚Äôt help themselves or care to get help at all. Whether new homeless programs are passed or not, I predict it getting worse without recovery coercion."

The problem has increased exponentially. The homeless budget for 2020 = $51 MILLION."

2,160008632,Cathy Van Blerkom,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,1 Sep,"Montclair Elementary also regularly uses the park, for PE it seems. Of course not at the moment."
3,160008632,Susan Marshall,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,1 Sep,"Only rarely have I seen Montclair Elementary using it, and that was primarily when the school field and playgrounds were not available due to the construction of the new classrooms."

5,160008632,Susan Marshall,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,1 Sep,"I filed a complaint yesterday with 311. I also emailed a complaint to the school from their website under the contact tab. I think everybody who is upset about this should also call 311 and also complain to the school. The person I spoke with at 311 said health inspectors would look into it. Please please if you have been as inconvenienced as I have and obviously other neighbors have, to file a complaint both with the City AND with the school."
6,160008632,Cathy Van Blerkom,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,1 Sep,"Yeah, probably during construction. Being across from the park, I just noticed them a lot."
7,160008632,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,1 Sep,"Last school year montclair elementary was using it for recess because their playground was being worked on. I don't mind it, the school kids need to play also. If it happened to be the much older rowdier kids that came when we were there, we'd just go to one of the other several parks within walking distance. No big deal. And as far as the mask issue, I see kids playing in the playground all the time without masks, not just the schoolchildren."
8,160008632,Stephanie Schwartz,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,2 Sep,"I would encourage people who are concerned to look at data and guidelines regarding masks for kids, especially outdoors."
9,160008632,Jennifer Hitchcock,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,1 Sep,Glad to see I‚Äôm not alone in this. I definitely don‚Äôt mind if the students use the park but it needs to be in a way that is socially responsible and accommodating for everyone who wishes to be there. I filed a complaint with the parks this morning and was able to speak with an associate from the school this afternoon. They were very understanding. They said they were going to try what I suggested above: for the students to use the field area of the park rather than the playground. I‚Äôm hoping they can stick to it!

22,160008632,Stephanie Schwartz,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,2 Sep,"I have to say, now that I've read this thread that most of this makes me really upset with our community. The people at Einstein Academy screen their kids and faculty members for illness several times a day, sanitize hands 8-10 times a day, and have asked their entire community to take a pledge to keep the community safe. I think they have gone above and beyond, and it doesn't seem like we are being the welcoming neighbors we could be. Shame on us."
23,160008632,Aubrey Markson,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,2 Sep,It does help to know the school‚Äôs recess times though if you want to avoid the older kids. Thank you Jennifer for posting that information!

We had no idea our using the park was such a problem for the community. We've only heard from one person via email and one person called yesterday, and I am not on Nextdoor, really, so there's no way for me to follow that thread. It's disappointing to hear that people think we are being irresponsible after all of the many many conversations we've had with community members and Parks & Rec and different health professionals over the last several months, but we obviously weren't able to speak with everyone before the school year began. Please please please ask anyone with concerns to reach out to me directly. We are more than happy to engage in a mutually-respectful conversation and try to come up with a win-win solution that works for everyone. Ultimately, we can only work on problems of which we are aware and partner with people who are willing to dialog with us. """
26,160008632,Susan Marshall,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,2 Sep,I also let them know about this thread this morning as I thought they should know how some in the community felt about this.

I was just so happy for those kids that they were out of their houses with their friends, in the open air, learning and playing. Didn‚Äôt even occur to me to be upset about it."
29,160008632,Jan H.,‚Ä¢ Lowry,35w,Stephanie you seem to have an  over-investment in the resultant outcome rather than allowing those that have the authority to evaluate the situation to make the decisions on behalf of the the entire community. Do your friends own Einstein Academy or do you have some other undisclosed relationship with them? Your ‚Äúover-selling‚Äù of the school‚Äôs reported compliance with COVID recommendations inside the School and your ‚Äúnotification‚Äù of the school by telling them what is in ND is clearly intended to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù them. 
30,160008632,Stephanie Schwartz,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,3 Sep,"I just know that I've had several conversations with them over the last several months, something I doubt any of you have done. I was a concerned neighbor when I heard a school was coming, and I wanted to make sure my young children were safe, so I made a point to get to know them. Maybe I am trying to protect them because I've seen the work they've done, and I know the potential they have to positively impact the community. They have been more than happy to make time for me and address my concerns, and they have no reason to do so. I just think it's far more productive to have real conversations and give people the benefit of the doubt than run around spreading rumors and gossiping about things when we don't know the facts. But, sure, let the ""authorities"" decide. I'm sure they'll see what I've learned."
31,160008632,Jan H.,‚Ä¢ Lowry,3 Sep,"Stephanie- When people post about their concerns on ND about what a school/a business or anyone is doing in their community and they ask for input from others, and get a variety of responses and hear what other people have seen and done to assess a situation, that is not called ""spreading rumors and gossiping"".

1,171568983,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Dec,Hi Julie. Thanks for the offer. The Elf would be getting mischievous while baking dog treats for a photo shoot for our business. Because of the flour component I don't want to borrow an Elf just in case the flour won't come off. I really appreciate the offer though!
2,171568983,Elizabeth Kucera,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Dec,I found them on botj Target and Walmart.com
3,171568983,Sheldon Sidney,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Dec,They had a ton yesterday at the Walmart on Hampden and Santa Fe.
4,171568983,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Dec,"I'll try that one omw home from work. Thanks. When I look up the inventory at Target, for example, it may say they have them there and then you show up and an employee laughs at you when you ask where they are lol. I had no idea these things were such a hot commodity."
5,171568983,Sheldon Sidney,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Dec,Liz LaRue yea it seems like they really blew up this year. That Walmart had a whole pallet about waist high with the elf‚Äôs and accessories. I feel like it was right when you walked in. Good luck!
6,171568983,Ana Gonzo,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Dec,"We also tried to find one. Inventory checks would say it would be at a certain location and then I'd go there and no Elf. I have an idea, I'll call you after my shift tonight!"

0,163913093,Michael Paglia,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,8 Oct,"Yes outdoor cats are rare in Denver--maybe because of the dangers from foxes, coyotes and racoons. Also Denver has a preponderance of responsible pet owners, so that may explain it, too. Our animal shelters here for instance have to import puppies and kittens for adoptions from more backward places where people don't spay and neuter their pets like they do here."
1,163913093,Gregory Clark,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,9 Oct,Backwards? Where are those places?
2,163913093,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,8 Oct,"I can tell you I see them ALL the time since I've moved here about a year ago. Some have collars, some don't, but they all look well kept and not feral."

4,163913093,Rick and Cathy Reynolds,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,8 Oct,"We've had 3 cats in the past, all outdoor.  One disappeared after a few months and two lived long and healthy lives.  None were de-clawed for their own protection.  Currently there are about 6 roaming our neighborhood during the day."
5,163913093,Keegan Perkins,‚Ä¢ Central Park,30w,"I think some people haven‚Äôt had cats, and are trying to be helpful, thinking a cat may be lost. They‚Äôre different than dogs. That said, I‚Äôm sure some cats shouldn‚Äôt go outside and do get lost, wander too far, become too independent, or find themselves in trouble. There‚Äôs a lot that can happen to any pet outside.(edited)"
6,163913093,Kate Killin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,30w,"I have an indoor cat and sometimes he tries to bolt outside. Thankfully we have always caught him but if he were to run away I would be devastated to think people would just assume he was an outdoor cat and not check try to catch him. Also, outdoor cats are a threat to wild birds, which already are dying at a high rate. Also, its technically a violation of Denver Animal Code to have an outside cat because you do not have control of your animal if it's free roaming.(edited)"
7,163913093,Cara Tedeschi,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,9 Oct,So Denver Animal Control have to pick up a cat and bring it in? Or  What about if there is a collar?
8,163913093,Claire Warnes,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,9 Oct,I‚Äôm from the UK and before moving to NY had never heard of ‚Äòindoor‚Äô cats!
9,163913093,James Scott,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,30w,Thank you! Cats are intelligent. They don't need to be prisoners of their people.(edited)
10,163913093,James Scott,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Oct,"Cats are independant intelligent creatures. They do great outdoors. They socialize with other cats & people. I know some cats are incapable of this, but most cats are happier & healthier, much like humans, when they can be active outdoors. If you think outdoor cats are a problem, I think you are a problem."

15,163913093,Allen Friedman,‚Ä¢ Central Park,9 Oct,We don't own any cats but there are a couple of outdoor cats in our neighborhood.  Nothing works better to keep the mice away.
16,163913093,Justine Meyers,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,9 Oct,I personally think it depends on the areas. My cat is an indoor cat unless I am outside with him to make sure he‚Äôs safe - that being said I live in an apartment and near a very busy intersection.. but when I lived in a more rural area my cat had access to indoors and outdoors and generally didn‚Äôt go to far.
17,163913093,Nora Weiker,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,9 Oct,"In Brevard CTY fla. there is a large Area between the port and the Hosp. The county  began breeding tux cats. There are at least close to 1000. They have vet care,    fed 2x daily, shelters...it is a sight to see.! N"
18,163913093,Shannon Burton,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Oct,"People worry too much.  I grew up in Estes Park and all of our cats were outdoor cats living in the mountains.  They were fine and lived happy long lives. My Mom's most current cat died at 20 the one before that was 18.  If i was a cat I would much rather take the risk and enjoy life and catch mice, then go stir crazy staying inside all the time."
19,163913093,Rae Bevis,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,12 Oct,Agreed
20,163913093,Linda Hendrick,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,9 Oct,"Until recently, I never had indoor cats. But about about 3 years ago, I adopted an 8-year old cat. My other (18-year old) cat would go out in my fenced backyard and sun himself, but never left the yard. The newer 8-year old jumped the 8' fence daily, but jumped it again to get back in the house until . . . the day he didn't and was gone 5 days. Upon his return, the vet bill for his injured leg was almost $500. He was never allowed outside again, and neither was the kitten I adopted 3 years ago. They both appear quite happy to stay indoors."
21,163913093,Shannon Burton,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Oct,"People jump to conclusions when they see animals.  Like this guy thinks he is ""rescuing"" puppies, and the vet tells the guy to return the litter of pups back to where he took them because they are fox cubs and he took them from thier Mother.  ü§¶"
22,163913093,Dakota Mancillas,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,30w,"Depends on where in Denver I guess, my cat growing up didn‚Äôt like being inside but he liked being bad and beating up the neighbors dog & cats so we tried to keep him inside lol but mainly he went outside & came back home whenever he pleased (before he started being bad)(edited)"
23,163913093,shannon quillian,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Oct,I can‚Äôt really add cuz I have had many cats and keep them indoors But last winter there was a cat that came to my backdoor and looked cold and hungry. It was snowing. I felt sorry for it and fed it and built a makeshift shelter out of boxes and blankets only to find out later that it belonged to the lady across the alleyway.
24,163913093,Kacey Mathews,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,9 Oct,"No, they‚Äôre not. I volunteer at Denver Dumb Friends League & they‚Äôre always getting in lost cats. They post pictures of all the lost & found cats on their website."
25,163913093,Oakley Cobb,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,9 Oct,I think that it is becoming more rare as people become aware of the negative impact that outdoor cats have on songbird populations.
26,163913093,Debbie Alther,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Oct,Exactly what I was going to say. I love cats and song birds which is why when I had cats they were always indoors.
27,163913093,Judith Holland,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,9 Oct,I agree that the dangers of preditors to cats should keep them inside. There are also diseases like feline HIV among others that can kill them.

6,161523641,Ingrid Underwood,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Sep,"If the frame is in decent shape, someone could reupholster them.  It is sometimes cheaper to reupholster than to buy new couches.   Otherwise, post them as free on Nextdoor, Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace and set in the alley or front yard with a free sign.  They will be picked up by someone!  Some of the donation places will pick up - some are free and some are for a fee.  You have to check their websites.  We had several desks and dressers and they were very selective about what they took and had to be small enough that ONE person could move it.  Some are not doing pickups at all due to Covid."

8,160878572,Halyna N.,‚Ä¢ Peterson Road,10 Sep,The mass mailers are just that. It's cheaper to send out to everyone than to check who already responded.

16,160878572,Gayle N.,‚Ä¢ Upper Skyway,9 Sep,You are kidding. Lets have respect. Please! President Trump was just asking you to make sure your vote was counted and not thrown out by the Democrats!!!
17,160878572,Robin L.,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,34w,"Somehow some folks here don't understand that the U.S. Census began shortly after President Washington took office. We are Americans and need to be counted. Don't make this institution into something political. Think of participating in the Census as important as voting, except that it only happens every ten years. Come on, you can do this successfully 5 times in your adult life without complaining, can't you?(edited)"
18,160878572,Deon G.,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,10 Sep,"Well said. I have worked every census since college, and you‚Äôre right ‚Äì people don‚Äôt understand how critical a complete count is. It is so much more than redistricting, and those who are typically undercounted go without the services they need."

22,160878572,Paul M.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,9 Sep,"What have the census workers been doing all summer?  They have had five months to visit all non-responding addresses in their assigned areas.  Or perhaps someone at the office is exceptionally slow to update the outstanding address list?  Either way, this seems like a management incompetence issue so typical of government operations."
23,160878572,Casey E.,‚Ä¢ Cragmor,10 Sep,They purposely wait to allow people time to voluntarily complete the census. That info is available to you.

WTH???? When I say I don't know, then I DON'T KNOW!!!"
28,160878572,Lynn Buschhoff,‚Ä¢ Union Station,10 Sep,"I believe you. As David Brooks notes in The Second Mountain, one of the victims of the past three decades of urban planning is the community. It used to be the community that taught , nourished and supported each other. Now we live in isolation and have to turn to government and ngo's for community. It is no wonder you don,t know your community, especially during a pandemic.  Judging from the previous snarky comments in this thread, it is going to take a lot of forgiveness before we can reweave a strong sense of community in this country. At least people are talking , though I wish they weren,t so busy playing the blame game."
29,160878572,Ruth P.,‚Ä¢ Palmer Park,10 Sep,It makes me sad that something so important as the Census which determines how federal monies and representation of the people has to become so political.  You are asked a few simple questions.  What are you trying to hide?

33,160878572,Laura H.,‚Ä¢ Jackson Creek,10 Sep,If they can't get a hold of someone they then go to their neighbors to at least get a head count of how many were living in the residents on April 1. My neighbor was out of town due to his father in law being sick then passing away.  So i had someone knocking on my door to get their info.
34,160878572,Rosie B.,‚Ä¢ Old Colorado City,34w,I called the Regional Census office in Dallas and spoke with a very nice lady.  she said the enumerators (census takers) are allowed to ask certain questions about your neighbors if they cannot get in touch with them.  She suggested to call our local office if you have any questions - 719-257-5049.  I also discussed the problems with people posting comments and using this as a political forum - Again - she suggested calling the local office.(edited)

The actual owner was walking around calling him and I asked her what he looked like. I had to bring her into our backyard where Cheddar was laying in the sun under our awning. We still see him although I suspect the thrill of the ruse has worn off since we now know what he's been up to because we don't see him except for a couple times a week now."

9,160096746,Paige Burkeholder,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park East,5 Sep,CPD is proposing a Group Living Amendment #7 that will not only significantly increases the number of residents allowed in a residential home but also allows for Community Corrections (felons in the system) and 24/7 homeless shelters in Denver residential neighborhoods.  Buffer zones from schools will be removed.  Permitting for additional residents will no longer be required.  Notifications will be given but not the ability to approve or deny.

4,162690330,Jeff Krump,‚Ä¢ Windsor East,28 Sep,This is not the role of government. City council has enough on their plate. Deal with the homeless problem or the protestors who are damaging property. No restaurant nor patron is forced to use the delivery service.  If the price is too much people and restaurants will quit using the service.
5,162690330,Cynthia Ivers,‚Ä¢ Lowry,29 Sep,Should be supply and demand. This is not the role of govt.

1,174845976,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,25 Jan,"Probably because it's the access to their store, the only business currently open at that location."
2,174845976,Ashley Dancho,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Jan,"Exactly, I called and spoke with the Sprouts GM this AM and she was appalled, had no idea this had been going on for months and they are often placed directly at the exit intersection where all their customers drive over.  She wants the landlord of the shopping mall to get involved, then they, they will do what they can to help."
3,174845976,Sarah Makarechian,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Jan,So messed up.
4,174845976,Bobby Yocum,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Jan,If this is a recurring event someone should point a camera in that direction to figure out what's going on.
5,174845976,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,25 Jan,"I hope someone from the store reads this and does it. That would go a long way to stopping the problem, wouldn't it?"
6,174845976,Ashley Dancho,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Jan,"Kelly Taylor See above, Sprouts GM is now alerted and involving the landlord of the shopping mall."
7,174845976,Michelle Bowers,‚Ä¢ Bluff Lake Aurora,25 Jan,"Thank you for taking notice and doing something about this. Thanks for the warning as well. It‚Äôs a day-ruiner when you end up with a nail in your tire, not to mention all the other problems this could cause. I had no idea - thanks again."

9,174845976,Chris Perez,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Jan,"Ashley Dancho thanks for the heads up! Sorry about the tire loss, that is rotten."
10,174845976,Theresa Venters,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,25 Jan,"Wow, we were wondering how we had 2 nails in two tires! Total of 4 nails. ü§î"
11,174845976,Ashley Dancho,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Jan,I am sorry to hear this Theresa Venters - it is really worrying to me that this has gone on so long with so many affected.
12,174845976,Ashley Dancho,‚Ä¢ Central Park,26 Jan,Theresa Venters if you frequent this area of 35th and think you got nails in your tire from there then I would encourage you to report it.  The information to do so is listed above.
13,174845976,Ryan Mac,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Jan,This explains the nail in my tire!!!!

When I'm on my bike or walking, I pick up every nail or screw or any other weird metal chunks in the road that I see. I figure one less flat is always a good thing! I find quite a lot, and hope that by picking them up every time I see them it will make a difference. Lots of construction going on everywhere in Denver, so I'm sure that's a big part of where they come from!"
17,174845976,Yvette Johnson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Jan,Thanks for sharing. So this is basically in front of Sprouts?
18,174845976,Ashley Dancho,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Jan,All along 35th in both directions eastbound and westbound and they have been predominantly between Quebec and CPB but it seems others have found them East of CPB in the community as well.
19,174845976,Lesley Lochhead,‚Ä¢ Lowry,25 Jan,If this has happened more than once it really seems like this isn't an accidental drop of nails by a construction truck or whatever. I agree with the person  who said sprouts should turn a camera to view that area.

26,174845976,Mrs. Vivian M Beanum,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,26 Jan,Is it just nails?  Any report of screws in the road?
27,174845976,Derek Carosi,‚Ä¢ Central Park,26 Jan,That would explain my flat last week....
28,174845976,Francie Dudrey,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,26 Jan,You too?!? Hubs and I had one on each of our cars. UGHHHHH.
29,174845976,Cynthia Bourret,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15w,Thanks so much for posting this!  I drive on run-flat tires that cost $1200 to replace so I'm very grateful.  I will avoid that area for now.(edited)
30,174845976,Ashley Dancho,‚Ä¢ Central Park,29 Jan,Hello (again) nails all over 35th again today so if you passed by and had any tire trouble please report it right away - information to do so is in posting above.
31,174845976,Steve Haddock,‚Ä¢ Central Park,11 Mar,Well we found more nails tonight on 35th Ave next to Papa John‚Äôs.
32,174845976,Steve Haddock,‚Ä¢ Central Park,11 Mar,Correction black screws
33,174845976,Steve Haddock,‚Ä¢ Central Park,11 Mar,I found 2 screws in my wife‚Äôs car last week. Unfortunately it was in side wall resulting in having to buy new $400 tire. 
34,174845976,Ashley Dancho,‚Ä¢ Central Park,12 Mar,"I am sorry Steve, please be sure to save your documentation, report it to your local precinct and anytime you see these Sprouts has asked that their GM be notified via her call right away. Khadija 720.629.5104."
35,174845976,Mike Alexander,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,13 Mar,"This doesn't help the core problem, but may save you all money. Go to the automotive section in Walmart or any auto parts store and buy tire plugs. As long as the nail goes through the tread and not the sidewall, plugs will fix your tire so it doesn't need to be replaced. Plugs will often last for the life of your tire. I've used them for a long as I've been driving (which is longer than I care to admit)."

19,171290132,Karylle Silva,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,20 Dec,We always have have tamales and posole on Christmas eve. Pampa said it was because we have something to unwrap. I kill the posole. I do tamales with red chile I get in new Mexico. It really isn't that hard and I find it soothing to spend some time doing it. I have extra red chilies if you would like. The corn wraps and masa are cheap at most grocery stores. You can do this.
20,171290132,Karylle Silva,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,20 Dec,Oh and also the thing about homemade is you can control sauce to meat ratio and masa thickness
21,171290132,Omar Cisneros,‚Ä¢ Central Park,22 Dec,El Tamalero is an Aurora staple for sure. Gotta get there super early if you want the good stuff though.

0,160556626,Veronica Barahona - Ziegler,‚Ä¢ Central Park,6 Sep,Unfortunately you have to go thru the eviction process.
1,160556626,Linda Hendrick,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,6 Sep,"The entire process can take up to 90-days. Please read up, because you need to follow up EXACTLY as the law requires in order to get them out. If you follow the rules, the Sheriff will come and personally evict them at the end of 90-days, but you have to get the ball rolling by crossing your t's and dotting your i's! BTW, Trump has been trying to pass some kind of Exec Order that no one can get evicted until after the 1st of the year, but I don't think he's gotten it through yet."
2,160556626,marcia jones,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,6 Sep,I also think the governor and mayor are against evictions at this time.  People can't find work and the homeless situation is getting worse.  I think you have to go through the eviction process.
3,160556626,Terri Moore,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,6 Sep,He had over 30 days to find a place. We have been told that other family members have offered to take him in and he refuses.
4,160556626,Jacqueline Bell,‚Ä¢ Central Park,6 Sep,My sister had squatters at the home she listed. She paid them off and they left.
5,160556626,Melissa Jaure,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,18 Sep,From what she explained it doesn‚Äôt appear he is a squatter 1 2 as a tenant he has rights! A lot of them. It would be cheaper to pay 3 -6 months of rent payments to him then going through the process 3) there is government orders due to pandemic. 4) there are laws that govern the transaction itself.5) super bad karma to put a human being out right now 6) consider renting to him at least until the end of year
6,160556626,Kirk Wayland,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,6 Sep,Never on the lease means he‚Äôs just squatting and therefore trespassing.....but I‚Äôm no expert.
7,160556626,Terri Moore,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,6 Sep,I agree but have been told that is not how it works. Makes no sense but then what does these days?
8,160556626,Tree Wallace,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 Sep,If his name isn‚Äôt on the  lease how does he have any right to b there? He‚Äôs a squatter! How can the police not do anything?  Sounds like u need legal advice.  So sorry! Can u appeal to the sister to help u out?
9,160556626,Terri Moore,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,35w,That is what I thought too. We don't have any extra money at this point. We needed to sell the properties to pay my mothers care. He had a month to find a place and we were also told that other relatives have offered to take him in but he refuses.(edited)
10,160556626,Gretchen Koehler,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,6 Sep,I agree with Kirk and Jacqueline.  If you want this solved fast make him an offer..  https://ipropertymanagement.com/laws/colorado-squatters-rights
11,160556626,Terri Moore,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,6 Sep,unfortunately there is no extra money to do that. This is why we are selling them. Thanks for the link though.
12,160556626,Caitlin P.,‚Ä¢ Lowry,6 Sep,I mean I‚Äôm not sure what the Mortage cost is but if it‚Äôs going to cost you one more mortgage payment for the 30 days it takes to evict him plus the court cost. He may leave for like $500 or $1000 and no eviction on his record. If you think about it makes more sense to try a low amount buy out.
13,160556626,Terri Moore,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,7 Sep,You are right about that. He wants $2000.00 to leave. It is ridiculous but looks like we don't really have another choice at this point we need to close on these ASAP. My mother needs that money for her care. This is extortion and still not right. I cannot believe there is nothing the law can do to protect us from this happening.
14,160556626,Deborah Stough,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Sep,Pay them
15,160556626,Terri Moore,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,7 Sep,Looks like that is what we are going to have to do. I cannot believe that it has come down to this. It is extortion!
16,160556626,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,8 Sep,I disagree. If he says he wants $2000 you tell him you don‚Äôt have that much and can give him $300 to get out
17,160556626,Jan Rehfuss,‚Ä¢ Lowry,7 Sep,Can you just watch the house until he leaves and then just change the locks?
18,160556626,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,7 Sep,Haha thats brillant
19,160556626,Liz Gordon,‚Ä¢ Central Park,7 Sep,I second the change the locks idea. You could always call the non-emergent police dispatch to request and escort while you have the locks changed.
20,160556626,Terri Moore,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,7 Sep,We will be doing that as soon as he signs the paper saying he agrees to vacate. We are going to have to pay him to do that now though which horrible. It is extortion and I don't know how that is even legal.
21,160556626,Christina Ulster,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Sep,Trump‚Äôs order only applies to people who can‚Äôt pay rent because of the pandemic. You should still be able evict people for cause (in this case squatting in your house).
22,160556626,Terri Moore,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,7 Sep,I completely agree and he has been offered a place to stay he refuses to go until he gets money. It is so infuriating!!
23,160556626,Christina Ulster,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Sep,I‚Äôm honestly surprised that you can‚Äôt have him arrested for criminal trespass since he was not on the lease. Sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this added stress at what I‚Äôm sure is already a stressful time.
24,160556626,Terri Moore,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,7 Sep,Me too! Thanks. Yes things were already stressful enough this the last thing we needed on top of it.
25,160556626,Jill Jacobs,‚Ä¢ Lowry,7 Sep,"Under Colorado law if a person is allowed into a house with permission originally, then the person is not a squatter even if that person isn‚Äôt on the lease.  You can‚Äôt change the locks when you have someone living in your property because self help is not available in Colorado. Instead, you have to go through the eviction process or work out a deal so that the person voluntary leaves. Make sure that you give him the money only when he hands you the keys.  Just hoping to add some clarity from a real estate lawyer..."
26,160556626,Jan H.,‚Ä¢ Lowry,7 Sep,"So the person on the lease, is the one who is allowed to let someone in (the brother). The owner of the property is NOT the one who is legally given the right to grant permission or not?"
27,160556626,Crystal Andersson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Sep,If it‚Äôs your property you should move in too. It‚Äôll get really uncomfortable for him real quick.
28,160556626,Crystal Andersson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Sep,...and bring some large slumber party buddies.

0,177817757,Andrew Adamsbaum,‚Ä¢ Beeler Park,20 Feb,"Hi Paulina.  That's great that you guys are getting into some outdoor adventures!  Will you be camping or backpacking?  Forgive me if you already know this, but backpacking means parking the car and carrying all your stuff on your back to your campsite, while camping might mean driving to a campsite and unloading directly from the car for the night.  Both are fun, but the requirements are pretty different, the big difference being you'll want to be a lot more weight-conscious for backpacking as the pounds you carry add up fast.  For example, when my girlfriend and I go backpacking with our dog, we all cram into a 2-person tent just because it'll save us 2-4lbs."
1,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,20 Feb,Thank you so much for all this info Andrew Adamsbaum! For now we plan to camp not backpack but perhaps one day we will graduate to that adventure! My husband was looking at the Northface Dolomite   bag with 3 layers for different temps. in my opinion was a little pricey ($200) but what do I know. That said it‚Äôs synthetic and based on what you said I think we def would prefer down since we both get cold easily. We have been looking at inflatable pads so will def look into the Neo. I know the pad makes a lot of difference! 
2,177817757,Jane Pacheco,‚Ä¢ Elyria Swansea,10 Mar,"Such helpful info, thanks!"
3,177817757,Kimberly Pugh,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,20 Feb,My suggestion from a person that loves to camp. Is to get the Colman cot. They fold up into a bag and keeps you off the ground. Easy to put stuff under as well.
4,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,20 Feb,Ooooooh I think we would like this a lot. Thank you Kimberly Pugh! Will look into it.
5,177817757,Bella Lo,‚Ä¢ Clayton,20 Feb,"Hi Paulina! Excited for you all! A piece of advise given that your first trip is to Moab - make sure you stake your tent really well and use all of the extra lines they give you!

6,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,20 Feb,"Thank you Bella Lo! We went to Moab last year and rented a teardrop trailer and the wind was NO JOKE! I dont know how I forgot this so thank you for the reminder bc you‚Äôre right, that‚Äôs more planning for a tent! "
7,177817757,Elizabeth Yeung,‚Ä¢ Central Park,20 Feb,"Splurge for a decent sleeping bag, and get individual ones! Check out rei- and aim for down"
8,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,20 Feb,"Thanks Elizabeth Yeung! In your opinion, what is the advantage over the individual bag v a 2-person bag? I would think the close body warmth would be helpful in the bigger bag?"
9,177817757,Carrie Lambert,‚Ä¢ Skyland,20 Feb,"Sierra Trading Post over on the west side of town has great deals on quality equipment! Also, REI is a great resource to learn about gear and they have great customer service and warranty for items!

10,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,20 Feb,Thx! We got our snowshoes at Sierra Trading Post so we def have that on our list!
11,177817757,Maria Draco,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,11w,"Cots are lifechangers.  I've done the sleeping bags and mats, but the cots are it for me.  Bulkier, and more gear to carry around, but worth it for the comfort.(edited)"
12,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,20 Feb,Yes def going to look into these. Do you have a specific one we should consider?
13,177817757,Katie Erickson,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,20 Feb,"We have down Nemo bags, the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs have zippers on opposite sides so you can zip them together, down is more expensive up front but lasts longer if you take care of it, keep an eye on REI sales, I think we got our bags for 30% off. And klymit for a pad! They have several 2 person pads that work for backpacking too, if you decide to go for it."
14,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,21 Feb,"Going to check out those Nemo bags, thank you!"
15,177817757,Anthony Howlett,‚Ä¢ Central Park,20 Feb,"a single sleeping bag is MUCH warmer than zipping two together because you can close it up around you and keep in your body heat. I second a cot also, the difference in temperature 24"" above the ground as opposed to on the ground is significant and you can put your stuff underneath. Which probably doesn't sound too important but when you are looking for a flash light and shoes in the pitch black ,to go to the bathroom, it's huge! Enjoy!"
16,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,21 Feb,I think I‚Äôm sold on the cot! Thank you!

19,177817757,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,21 Feb,"REI has such great options, and if you get their store brand, it has a lifetime warranty. Down sleeping bags (to 20F) are good for many seasons (not winter), and you can keep them zipped open in warmer months...down is so versatile for camping in Colorado and even in Utah (which still has 4K altitude and cooler temps at night). That store also has some used gear."
20,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,21 Feb,Didn‚Äôt know about they lifetime warranty so I think we‚Äôll def be going there and if anything will use it for research!
21,177817757,Christina Swanson,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,21 Feb,Nemo has a two person sleeping bag.
22,177817757,Nate Hull,‚Ä¢ Skyland,22 Feb,"If you're just getting into this, and initially only pursuing warm weather camping, I'd start with something super cheap to make sure this is something you can't live without before investing in really high quality gear. For years I used to get everything from Walmart or Big5 until I realized how often I use and need to replace this stuff."
23,177817757,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,22 Feb,"That approach makes sense if you can afford to keep replacing (and donate the old stuff). Or, since Paulina has outdoor goals, it might be best to get something better early on....which saves money and is more environmentally sustainable in the long run ."
24,177817757,Carly Erickson,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Feb,"My husband and I both have Kelty Galactics. They can zip together to form a 2-person bag (I have the women's and he the men's so the women's bag side is two-ish inches shorter at the top.) We have used them zipped together but actually prefer to sleep our separate sleeping bags and then snuggle. We both feel like it is warmer that way. Depending on how your dog sleeps, you may want to get them their own sleeping bag as well. Our dog will not get in our bags, zipped together or separate."
25,177817757,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,22 Feb,A good sleeping pad is important to insulate for warmth if on the ground.
26,177817757,Maureen Upton,‚Ä¢ Central Park,22 Feb,"LL Bean full-size 3‚Äù camp mattress is the bomb, great quality, totally insulates you froM Even frozen ground.  Takes up darn near whole tent but it‚Äôs just like cushy carpeting for our tent-home. And a string of battery-powered lights make it cozy, better than staring into each other‚Äôs blinding headlamps. We‚Äôve got a nice camp"

We set up our tent in our living room and tested out a great cot from our neighbor (thank you Maria Draco!) We decided a cot is not ideal for the sizing of our tent. We decided to go with the Klymit insulated Double V sleeping pad instead. Also based on everybody‚Äôs feedback, we decided to forgo a double sleeping bag and get individual ones.

9,180320809,Alexis Carrington-Ford,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,16 Mar,I ask only because our are rather small but I do wonder about break ins
10,180320809,Alexis Carrington-Ford,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,16 Mar,Gotcha. I like the nest or ring products as they have window sensors that will alert you if some tries to open a door or window. And if you are away they act a motion sensor as well. But I wonder if bars might be in order of they are large. I have both the best and ring products btw.
11,180320809,Glenn Godden,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,16 Mar,But you're implying they are the ones that are responsible for all the break ins cause they can fit into small areas correct? Pretty big assumption on your part. Lots of skinny people of all races out there.
12,180320809,Gloria BURNS,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,16 Mar,"Put a lock on your gate you can get bars for the basement windows or put in alarms if the window opens your neighbor will hear it, i put something in front of all my windows plants bottles anything to make noise the most important thing is to make it hard for them put a lock on your gate.what i want to do this summer is raise my gate make sure the smooth side is on the out side and to make real hard put wood on front and back so they don't have any thing to climb up on. we all need to go watch some home alone.Smile (peace)"
13,180320809,Terry Sipes,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,16 Mar,"My bad if it came off like that, maybe I should have said the sneak thieves use their children to go through the window open the back door and let the parents, aunts, uncles do the work. That's not comforting to the woman that has small windows, or the people whom were shot on the Monaco/11th area as the strong arm men dressed up in orange vest and did a strong arm robbery gone bad, thank god for the police on that one... or the robbery/rape at high noon on 6th/Lyden last summer and on and on and on, no neighborhood is safe in Denver, but you can be smart about your surrondings, but be safe...

1,171920300,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,27 Dec,Will get that bill through because there are enough of those to override Trump's silly veto. He's such an idiot

8,171920300,Jessica Watson,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,27 Dec,Jamie Tenace Tenace there is not...its an extention of time not adding additional payments. Its for the new people filing and those who didn't receive the one time stimulus yet.

12,171920300,Jessica Watson,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,27 Dec,Yes its an extention of time not additional funding. If you haven't received this give more time as well as for the people just filing.

Yeah $2000 is great but that‚Äôs the way I look at it    After all the negotiations to even get to an agreement that $600 is what they could do and the $300 and now to not sign that bill after people who need that $ immediately is just so messed up that it‚Äôs unbelievable.    Now it‚Äôs a step backwards!!       SAD !
16,171920300,Caitlin McIntyre,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Dec,"I believe the extension was put in place for those who just started collecting unemployment starting in November. The payment was set to give those who had applied for unemployment starting March-October, but since the rate of those filings went up starting in November, the governor extended that order to include those who filed starting in November or now. That way they can be included in that one time payment."
17,171920300,Jessica Watson,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,27 Dec,Yes exactly. Its and extention of time not additional funds.

20,171920300,Breanna Oneill,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,27 Dec,Honestly I've heard both ways. Idk... I get unemployment through TN and they denied me an extension. Like look here. Im in CO and a bartender... I have a daughter with an autoimmune disease... im a single mom who has exhausted all resources.... I was willing to settle for that little bit bc its SOMETHING.
21,171920300,Jessica Watson,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,27 Dec,You should apply for pandemic unemployment and you may be able to do that in co because your living here.
22,171920300,Jessica Watson,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,27 Dec,I'm sorry to say this because I sure hoped we would get it. HOWEVER this is an extention of time. It extends the time the money is available for unemployment to send out. It still remains a one time payment meaning if you have gotten it once thats it. If you haven't this gives you more time to get it and for them to give it to new people applying for unemployment right now. Hopefully they work this out quickly but be prepared for a hard January as even if a federal stimulus was passed it would be mid to late January before anyone saw money.

26,171920300,Larissa Chmielewski,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,27 Dec,"It was a time extension, not an additional payment.

28,171920300,Tina F.,‚Ä¢ Legend Oaks,27 Dec,I talked to unemployment last week. My 26 weeks is up next month and my unemployment stops even though I have not been able to find a job . So I have absolutely no income. I don't qualify for the $375 they told me cause it is only for people that earn between $25-$300 a week on unemployment and I earned more than $300. Great system.
29,171920300,Tina F.,‚Ä¢ Legend Oaks,27 Dec,Also they told me there are no extensions past today.
30,171920300,Rae Zepp,‚Ä¢ Central Park,27 Dec,"I am on unemployment as well and it ended last week for me.  However, I am not mad at the President for not signing the bill.  No matter if he signs it for $600 or $2000 do you really think you're getting your check tomorrow.  Wake up people - no matter if you like the President or not he is trying to get more money for YOU!  That way you can ride out another month or two before finding a job at FedEx, UPS, Amazon, King Soopers/City Market, Target, Walmart, McDonalds, etc.  They are all hiring.  Don't forget the USPS is in dire need of people to work for them and have great benefits.  It's unbelievable how selfish and ungrateful people are today."

6,156960455,Brenda Thompson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Aug,I'm with you Larry. Porta-potties and trash bins. Plus a fence on the south border.
7,156960455,Michelle Olson,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,4 Aug,"Again, I just paid $410,000 for my 1ksf home in 2018. Who is going to pay for the loss that I will face from this encampment? I cannot afford this loss. This house is my retirement plan. I already need to work until I'm 75 just to retire.  I should just shoot myself right now because I will never ever be able to recover the loss that I will face from this."
8,156960455,Larry Clark,‚Ä¢ Central Park,4 Aug,I'd go even further and recommend that the area be used to build housing & services for the homeless
9,156960455,Haley Johnson,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,"On 40th and Colorado there was housing built for the homeless a few years ago that is now experiencing lots of drugs, crime and violence and that is in an appartment!"
10,156960455,Yanka Skyton,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,Your recommendations are kind of irrelevant since your neither live nor have a voice in district 8. Maybe reach out to your local gov-t instead?
11,156960455,Larry Clark,‚Ä¢ Central Park,4 Aug,"And ""yes"", I'd be willing to be taxed a bit more to help pay for it.  Assuming those kind of replies will be forthcoming..."
12,156960455,Mike McCumber,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,"Larry, how about offering up your backyard? I will pay for the porta potty and wash station. Deal ?"
13,156960455,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,7 Aug,Larry you can make a donation I don‚Äôt want to pay additional taxes on my county taxes I‚Äôm sure a lot don‚Äôt agree with additional taxes they just added for teachers and I‚Äôm sure Tay Anderson for his security aren‚Äôt we taxed enough pretty soon we will be taxed out.
14,156960455,DJ Leaderach,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,Again all people who dnt live right near it. People who live close don‚Äôt want it. Can‚Äôt you respect that??
15,156960455,Suzzette F.,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,4 Aug,Thank you for putting all the links into the email made it a lot easier to contact them.
16,156960455,Elizabeth Ivy,‚Ä¢ Clayton,4 Aug,"I agree with Suzzette, thank you for putting up the links."
17,156960455,Trinell Mack,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,I was wondering what happened to all of the encampments by sams club. Here we go....
18,156960455,Christina Roybal,‚Ä¢ Clayton,4 Aug,Tonight drove by at 9pm and tents were all removed. I'm hoping someone from Denver City and County resolved this time.
19,156960455,Jessica Warren,‚Ä¢ Clayton,5 Aug,I saw one tent yesterday right before sunset.
20,156960455,De hervey Hervey,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,what happened to the parking lot at the Colosseum that is not being used for any entertainment?
21,156960455,Suzzette F.,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,5 Aug,I received a response from the city and they informed me that the illegal camping should have been removed as of last night.
22,156960455,Jamie Reyes,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,5 Aug,"The Park Hill golf course security team has been instructed to not allow anyone to camp there since after all, it is private property. Tents have been removed"
23,156960455,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,7 Aug,I assumed that the owner had approved since it had been known to Parkhill where did the rumors come from.  My concern would be as well that they may move to the neighborhood
24,156960455,Haley Johnson,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,7 Aug,"Kathy Wright, all I will say is that  the Denver department of health did come  assess the golf course for a homeless camp. There was also a very small news article about it. Theres a lot of shady things going on. And it is still a possibility."
25,156960455,Daniel Pacheco,‚Ä¢ Central Park,5 Aug,"The least we could do is stop calling it ""camping""."
26,156960455,Haley Johnson,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,5 Aug,"The last time I checked, when you sleep in a tent, it's called camping. What do you call it, when you set up a tent in the mtns, near a lake, or even in your backyard???"
27,156960455,John Howe,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,5 Aug,Thank goodness.  I lost much sleep over this.

3,172200514,Celine Batiste,‚Ä¢ Central Park,30 Dec,hello depending on what's wrong with your tire if there's a hole in it it can be patched and aired up and that is about $100 just give you a heads up

10,172200514,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,30 Dec,I think the shipping charges from eBay might be prohibitive!
11,172200514,Karyn Manzanares,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,30 Dec,"Look into Snap Finance. They only work with certain tire shops like Big O and that‚Äôs where we get tires from, but it‚Äôs a same as cash 90 day kind of thing, not determined by credit, apply and get approved online and no money down unless you want to put some down. We‚Äôve been doing it for years this way. Right around this time too so we don‚Äôt pay interest cause I make the biweekly payment and then pay it off out of my tax return."
12,172200514,Janelle Miller,‚Ä¢ Aurora,30 Dec,Wow!! What place is that? Have you tried discount tires? Or Firestone?-You can get their credit card and get a discount as well- they charge about $100/tire for a new all weather tire. I have an appointment with Firestone this Friday!
13,172200514,Janelle Miller,‚Ä¢ Aurora,30 Dec,Did you try calling Big O Tires too?
14,172200514,Nadine Rains,‚Ä¢ Aurora,30 Dec,"I‚Äôm heading to big Os now! I called sams and they didn‚Äôt have my tires, but big Os does, wild to think I can do two tires there at less than what I was being charged at this tire shop on colfax down the road from me ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

22,172200514,Laura Avant,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,30 Dec,We have used Discount Tires for years and even bought special wheels and tires for 4 wheeling.  They  are great and not all that expensive when you consider that it was our 50th wedding anniversary and 4 wheeling in Canyonlands was what we wanted to to.  they gave us a written estimate and honored it.
23,172200514,Stephen Williams,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,30 Dec,Check out the place at 6 and havana. Just south off the 7-11 next to car wash they have used tires and are cheap

1,168467710,Sam Christensen,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,20 Nov,"Absolutely!  We're moving one block north on Ash next month, so we were just driving over to see how the roof was coming along and saw her.  There were other people helping as well, and we got to meet some neighbors in the process.  "
2,168467710,Candas Yocum,‚Ä¢ Central Park,20 Nov,She‚Äôs beautiful!
3,168467710,Sam Christensen,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,20 Nov,"So pretty and sweet!  I hope her owners either receive the voicemails or see this post soon.  If not, I'll pick her up in a few days and put up fliers."

9,168467710,Chad Hinshaw,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,21 Nov,"I echo others, PLEASE consider other options like Dumb Friends League or Max Fund before using the Denver Animal Shelter. Denver will not scan for a microchip or attempt to locate owner, but they will give every vaccination under the sun to the dog on arrival regardless of whether it‚Äôs needed. This leaves the owners several hundred dollars bill to get their animal back. Given the current situation this can make it very difficult for owners to regain their pet, so if you have another option please consider it."
10,168467710,Sam Christensen,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,21 Nov,"I actually took her to Maxfund for the chip scan first, then held her myself for a few hours waiting for a response.  After a few hours I asked if Maxfund (both veterinary and shelter divisions) could hold her and they said they could not.  "
11,168467710,Ed Munoz,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,21 Nov,So she‚Äôs still at the shelter and owner‚Äôs (number on chip) have sadly not made contact yet...hopefully they will soon! She‚Äôll be there a minimum of 5 days before she can be considered to be adopted out.
12,168467710,Sam Christensen,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,24w,"Do you work at the shelter?  They said they will be making contact with me if she isn't picked up, and they added me to an auto update system that will notify me as soon as her owner claims her if it's before the five day hold (I have not received any notification yet).(edited)"
13,168467710,Sandy Kibling,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,21 Nov,"Thank you for taking care of Eve, I hope she gets home soon."
14,168467710,Susan Blake,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,21 Nov,Have you posted on PawBoost?
15,168467710,Sam Christensen,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,"I'm used to the shelter posting on Pawboost, so I didn't even check to see if they do this here.  I'm on it right now."
16,168467710,Sam Christensen,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,She's on Pawboost now.
17,168467710,Josh Buckman,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,21 Nov,I feel like we need an additional thank you for being A+ humans peppered into the comments here. That‚Äôs all. :)
18,168467710,Sam Christensen,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,24w,"Unfortunately Eve hasn't been picked up as of yet, so I'm going to make a flier and start putting them up around the neighborhood tomorrow.  If anyone wants the PDF to print and also put up, feel free to PM me your email address."

20,168467710,Dora Silver,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,22 Nov,"Sam your a true human being.. so many people are looking for companions right now. She‚Äôs beautiful and seems well adjusted. Maybe her parents left her in the care of someone when they went for the holidays and she escaped, she‚Äôs a husky after all but they are probably unaware I‚Äôm hoping. I know someone who is a dog rescue person who could help so let us know how to help you you‚Äôre an amazing person..."
21,168467710,Blake Lawler,‚Ä¢ Elyria Swansea,23 Nov,"I was actually going to say this, the owner may not know. We found a dog and their owner left him with a sitter he also had a microchip. Luckily she called back within an hour and had someone come get him. I wonder if there is a way to see if the address is correct like asking animal control to check the address or something ü§î"
22,168467710,Megan Landry,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,24w,"Sam, you amazing wonderful soul! Thank you for doing everything you could for this sweet baby! If my dog ever got out (god forbid), I would be devastated but I would want her to be found by someone like you! There are MANY wonderful things about Park Hill but the help and love for dogs in the neighborhood is nothing I have ever seen before! It's incredible, I've seen so much goodness and sweetness in this neighborhood and helping dogs!(edited)"
23,168467710,Sam Christensen,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,23 Nov,I haven't even moved in yet!  We just bought a house around 31st and Ash and get possession on the 4th.  We knew/know nothing about the neighborhood but this has been a great experience so far.  We were actually only driving over to check on the roof progress when we came across Eve.  
24,168467710,Megan Landry,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,23 Nov,Sam Christensen  Welcome to the neighborhood! This is the best neighborhood in Denver! I was born and raised in Denver and wouldn‚Äôt ever live anywhere else! We are so happy to have you as our neighbor! Please reach out if you need anything at all! We can help with supplies for Eve if need be! I know someone is missing her desperately I have all my fingers and toes crossed we find her owners!

28,168467710,Sam Christensen,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,24w,"So far I've emailed Dumb Friends League, Artic Rescue, and Red Fern Animal Rescue.(edited)"
29,168467710,Ann Burke,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Nov,"Hi, Samantha! Red Fern Rescue is low on fosters right now, but the Heads love Huskies. Will reach out to them since you have offered to foster, but they are also needing donations so could not afford to spay and properly vet Eve, as their budget is already allocated on the homeless dogs coming Dec 5th. However, we as neighbors could easily come together to help Eve financially through donating her medical and food needs to a Rescue. That being said, the care and luxurious housing at DSA is top notch. The best place for her to find her family right now is at the Denver Animal Shelter. What day is she listed for adoption? Please feel free to reach out to me."
30,168467710,Charlene Harlow,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,25 Nov,"Douglas County Canine Rescue is an option.  I haven‚Äôt been following your posts closely, but I‚Äôm surprised to read that that no one has stepped up to claim this husky. If you are willing to foster her even better. I‚Äôm sure they would help you ."
31,168467710,Sam Christensen,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,25 Nov,"Yes, I'm totally willing.  I know that's 2/3rds of the battle."

2,168358325,Blake Lawler,‚Ä¢ Elyria Swansea,20 Nov,"This is a good thing you do we have done it cause there were so many unfixed cats. We have three of our own all fixed, microchipped, and up to date on shots. I never knew how cat owners could just let their cats run around  until I became a cat owner and realized they do what they want. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3,168358325,Maria Draco,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,20 Nov,Continue the good work!! TNR is the humane solution to many issues. üôå  I've had to put my small project on hold until the clinics re-open. It's going to be another horrible kitten season.
4,168358325,Linda Ornelas,‚Ä¢ Adams Heights,20 Nov,I have a large colony of feral cats that I feed daily. I use my own money and give them leftovers from my cats and dog along with fresh cat food. I see them out in the cold and it breaks my heart. I see them limping sometimes and am confident that they are all homeless. I don't know what to do? If you find time I could use some help? I would say right now it's about 8 to 10 cats maybe more? You are a wonderful  person to dedicate yourself to this cause! I live in Commerce City off 68th and Clermont street. Please private message me if you are interested? God bless you!
5,168358325,Blake Lawler,‚Ä¢ Elyria Swansea,20 Nov,Oh wow bless your heart we did this for some cats when we first moved in 41st and Steele and were able to get traps from Metro Denver Cat. Unfortunately they're the only resource that I know of and they are not doing TNR right now. I know how overwhelming and heartbreaking it can be. I would call them and see what they suggest for the time being and what resources they have they are a wonderful resource. I love donating to them because of the impact on the community they have. It saddens me people get cats and let them outdoors without them being spayed and neutered especially with all of the resources that do it for free or with a small donation because then it ends up being a huge problem with cats that have no homes. üíîüò™üò≠
6,168358325,Nathalie Landeau,‚Ä¢ Central Park,20 Nov,Thank you for doing this.  I have done TNR in the past and it is not easy.  You are really helping those feral cats and also helping to prevent more unwanted cats !
7,168358325,Cecilia Allee,‚Ä¢ Commerce City,7 Feb,Hi I was wondering if you are able to tell me on how or who I can contact for them to come and get our family of cats that live here in my back yard there are 5 of them 3 of them have been here since being kittens so one of them is most likely the momma. My son makes sure they have food that is why they have stuck around. On one of the younger cats it has recently got sometime of injury to its front right foot or leg we cant get close enough to tell what has happened.  I dont mind if they are brought back just want them to be looked at and possibly fixed so they dont have anymore. Thanks Cecilia

1,153959463,Tom Yohe,‚Ä¢ Central Park,6 Jul,The Quality Inn has been converted into a interim stay facility to get people off of the streets and back on their feet.  Stays there are going to be 6 to 12 months.  It is not an overnight shelter for folks still living on the streets.

I will grab treats and call animal control if I see it again.  thanks for those suggestions.  I just assumed its family found it but Emily has seen it around last week so it is probably homeless and abandoned üò≠"

They are having to spread a lot of money around to convince folks that trees, fresh air and parks for families to enjoy are bad for the neighborhood.  In reality the only thing it's bad for is their bottom line.(edited)"

The city cleared them out a week ago.  The BBQ sponsored by the owner was a PR event.  Fortuitously, last Thursday at a community meeting our DPD community officer offered their supply of backpacks to be handed out at the event.  The DPD didn't plan on it, but it was a happy convergence, thus the police cars in the parking lot of the clubhouse on the south side.(edited)"

1,155657139,Jeannine S.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,22 Jul,Absolutely! Or for schools which I read is legal and what they might have done! This is not the time to spend money on something like this
2,155657139,Christine Shepherd,‚Ä¢ Five Points,24 Jul,Jeannine S. it's kind of like going to get your hair done while your house is on fire.
3,155657139,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,22 Jul,"They may be showing a diplomatic way of changing the atmosphere of that area.  The Corona virus is going to leave a depressing atmosphere on this nation, on much of the world.  It'll take some time for things to bounce back.  The year 2023 is not really that far away, just around the corner when you think of all of the people, just in the greater Denver area, who will be suffering great financial loss, many whom will not recover, many who never recovered from 2009."
4,155657139,Colin L.,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,22 Jul,That‚Äôs wishful thinking. The mall stretches for miles - won‚Äôt all be worked on at once. 
5,155657139,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,41w,"Yes, I will not argue those points.  It is wishful thinking; as opposed to biting the bullet of accepting that there simply is no rhyme or reason for the indecision, and such decisions made, by the city, in current times.  The start date alone seems to point to creating a positive to look forward to, while looking away from a plethora of problems too wearisome to keep looking at, let alone make decisions to remedy.(edited)"
6,155657139,Jeffrey Sturman,‚Ä¢ CBD,22 Jul,I'm glad they approved it and that local biz are funding it.
7,155657139,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,22 Jul,"With all that is going on that has been a great detriment to local businesses, residents, & customers, it is a thing to look forward to, as we endure this really long and spasmodic pause from what has been normal life, to whatever degree we have been living it."
8,155657139,Linda P.,‚Ä¢ Wellshire East,41w,"Watched the July 20 city council meeting and they go into great detail about why all but one council person decided to support the mall renovation.  They also explain why an editorial in the paper doesn't understand the situation under consideration.    Nothing is being cut by this vote from current school funding.  The 33 mil mentioned wouldn't necessarily go to the schools in any case if cut from the mall project. The state might reduce state funding to the schools if it did.  Without it, the mall renovation would likely be impossible for the next 10-20 years and other funding acquired from fed and other sources would almost certainly have to be returned to those sources and fought for again in years to come after it's already been hard fought & put in place now.  Needs and benefits were discussed.   Replay of the meeting is available through the city council website. It's a long meeting.  I believe discussion of this issue is the last agenda item. It's toward the end at any rate but it is a fairly long though interesting discussion.  Fast forward is available.  After listening, Denver Council's decision made a lot of sense to me.(edited)"
9,155657139,John Franquemont,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NW,23 Jul,"This project has been in the works for a long time. Infrastructure projects like this have a lot of moving parts and once they‚Äôre in motion, it‚Äôs difficult to just stop them due to a recent event (covid-19). These improvements have been warranted for awhile now and once completed, this could very well change the dynamic of the mall and Lodo. With the mall being more pedestrian and restaurant friendly, more people will be attracted to come and check it out. Not to mention, they‚Äôre adding more mature foliage and green space, which is always a worth-while improvement."
10,155657139,Ingrid K.,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,23 Jul,What they need to invest is more security around the mall and downtown areas!!

13,155657139,Florence Sebern,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,23 Jul,"The Denver Urban Renewal Authority declared this area blighted in order to  use Tax Incremental Funding (TIF) as a redevelopment tool. When TIF is used, all regular taxes are diverted to DURA (and the developer) for 25 years. This means that property tax revenues for schools are diverted, too."

20,155657139,Pam Becker,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,23 Jul,Maybe they want them wider for the tents though....
21,155657139,Jami Horwitz,‚Ä¢ Whittier,24 Jul,"The City of Denver's response to the homeless situation is identical to Trumps's response to COVID-19. Denver passed the camping ban, then totally dropped the ball as homeless numbers sky rocketed.  Eight years of this.  Coming up with a Corona virus vaccine seems like it will be easier than coming up with solutions for homelessness in Denver."
22,155657139,Pam Becker,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,24 Jul,"What‚Äôs crazy is that there are more places for the homeless right now than ever before.  The coliseum and local schools all opened up for them.  There are tons of organizations that are wanting to help, yet still the tent town grows!"

I'm just scared with new more contagious strain that it shouldn't be the time to let more people gather.

Then it was an estimate to have a manageable tool to gauge. Now we know too much. The system that Summit County deployed is more practical, yet still flawed because of the tourism variable (personalities willing to travel, same as those who take risk). It does NOT DO SMALL BUSINESS any favors ...in fact, it presents them with a whack-a-mole false tease of they have to go back to lock down on Sunday (which they will if it goes over 10%>>>>and if it is 8% NOW......it is already over 10%).

0,155678844,Gaar Potter,‚Ä¢ Happy Canyon,22 Jul,I just go look at the Capitol Building and Civic Center Park for my inspiration. GOOD JOB DENVER!
1,155678844,Ralph C.,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,22 Jul,Perhaps those of us with classic cars could expand the parade participants?
2,155678844,Gaar Potter,‚Ä¢ Happy Canyon,22 Jul,Looks like they want us to stay home:
3,155678844,Scott J.,‚Ä¢ Hampden East,22 Jul,Dont forget to wear yr mask and step around the homeless tents on the sidewalk. ü§´
4,155678844,Shirley Tracey,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,22 Jul,Perhaps those of us with AK47s could get a parade spot??? Just kidding. :-)
5,155678844,Shirley Tracey,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,22 Jul,"No it was just a joke.  I don't want to shoot anyone.  Several people on this website have been discussing buying guns for protection because we have so much crime in the neighborhood lately.  Sorry, I should have realized someone would think I was serious.  Just a stupid joke. No worries."
6,155678844,Heather Side,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills/Holly Ridge,22 Jul,A parade for all of the businesses lost? The people being evicted soon or the ones foreclosing on their homes? Or maybe it‚Äôs for the record unemployment in the state- will the roly poly Governor be there? Is it a parade for the record number of suicides in the state for the last 3 months? Or it must be for all the lonely people who can‚Äôt get together to worship. Just wondering WTF you think there is to celebrate?
7,155678844,Jeremy G.,‚Ä¢ Baker,22 Jul,"Suicides are down in CO, not up."
8,155678844,Shirley Tracey,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,22 Jul,"People are allowed to gather for BLM peaceful demonstrations, and to gather for defund police violent destruction, and gather in Civic Center Park to live in tents and party-on.  Freedom of speech only applies to some, they have privilege.  The rest of us just work to clean up the mess left behind."
9,155678844,Mary Jermance,‚Ä¢ Fort Logan,22 Jul,"After watching how people rallying in support of law enforcement in downtown Denver this past Sunday got attacked and beat up by hordes of ""Antifa"" thugs, and the Denver Police did nothing per instructions from above, think I'll pass, thanks all the same. I'll just stay home and ""re-imagine"" Denver as the really nice city it once was a very long time ago."
10,155678844,Shirley Tracey,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,22 Jul,Amen Mary!  Yes.  I too remember.  The violence in every city is horrible.
11,155678844,Jeffrey Sturman,‚Ä¢ CBD,23 Jul,In reality crime is at historic lows across the nation! Don't watch the lies at the pres rallies.
12,155678844,Andrew Rothman,‚Ä¢ Beeler Park,22 Jul,Just turn off fox news and it all goes away...like a miracle.
13,155678844,KR C.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,23 Jul,Really?  I though MSM wanted it to all go away....
14,155678844,Shirley Tracey,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,23 Jul,What is MSM?  I like to know what is happening so I read and watch and listen to a variety of perspectives.  Fox shows video you won't see and interviews you won't hear anywhere else.  I wonder why?
15,155678844,KR C.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,23 Jul,Mainstream media.  I have heard them minimize the riots frequently or not report on them at all.  Very few if at all reported on the riot Sunday at Civic Center Park attacking the pro police PEACEFUL protestors.  Some barely got away with their lives.
16,155678844,KR C.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,23 Jul,"My hope is that the leaders in power will have the Capitol building cleaned and repaired as well as the buildings and businesses surrounding it.  Take care of the crime and hope that we can come to better and more positive solutions rather than what is going on in our city currently.  A neighborhood parade is nice, but there are bigger issues to solve and hope that there can be unity with various positive solutions."
17,155678844,Shirley Tracey,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,23 Jul,When people  continue destroying property and attacking people who is going to come together with positive solutions and unity.  I am more realistic than that.  The longer this rioting goes on the more I am disliking this movement.  The value of the original mission has been lost.  Now it is just evil.
18,155678844,Dee S.,‚Ä¢ Five Points,23 Jul,Perhaps the parade can showcase the location selected by each city council member for the homeless encampment in their District as requested by the mayor.
19,155678844,Shirley Tracey,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,23 Jul,That is hilarious Dave.
20,155678844,Digital Marketing Strategist Kersten Arnold,‚Ä¢ City of Denver,24 Jul,"This thread is now off-topic and has been closed.

2,156274774,Charles Telles,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,29 Jul,He's just an idiot and embarrassment. He doesn't have a clue what to do. Good thing he can't run again but he still has lots of time to ruin things.
3,156274774,John Beldock,‚Ä¢ RiNo Art District,1 Aug,The mayor is being undermined by city council.
4,156274774,Gaar Potter,‚Ä¢ Happy Canyon,40w,John B. Not really. Their boots (jack) sound like they hit the ground pretty much in unison...(edited)
5,156274774,Victoria Herne,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,30 Jul,We voted on allowing camping and the vote was no.  Now he wants to turn the Denver Coliseum parking lot into an encampment.  He needs to respect the voters.  The executive branch is supposed to enforce the laws not ignore them.
6,156274774,John Beldock,‚Ä¢ RiNo Art District,31 Jul,The mayor is being undermined by city council.
7,156274774,Sally G.,‚Ä¢ College View / South Platte,31 Jul,I agree with all of you!
8,156274774,Peter F.,‚Ä¢ Eastmoor Park,2 Aug,People I am a huge conservative! We need to consider all people during this time of crisis. Homeless People need a safe haven were they can stay distanced and reasonable safe. We need to address the Homeless crisis but this is not the time to get confrontational about the encampment.
9,156274774,Reeves B.,‚Ä¢ Harvey Park,28 Aug,I never participate in online chats about public policy because my observation has been that such chats are usually driven by emotions and competing political ideologies with very limited awareness of the facts ...but I just CAN'T resist weighing in on this homeless discussion.
0,156455930,Maria A. Garcia,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,30 Jul,There was a camper on fire but thats all i saw....also noticed that Spencer park is becoming a homeless camp park
1,156455930,Julie Elliott,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,3 Aug,I noticed that as well. It doesn‚Äôt seem to keep people from enjoying the playground though. Thanks for letting me know about the camper. It was about a block west of the park and I couldn‚Äôt see what was going on down there while on my way home from the store. Thank you for the info.
0,174010975,Sherry Liberato,‚Ä¢ 92nd and Grove,16 Jan,What kinds of things?
1,174010975,Sarah Sheehan,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,16 Jan,I am currently working with two families that have very little.  I am happy to share more details about these families privately but here are the basics: 
2,174010975,Carol Giambri,‚Ä¢ Church Ranch Blvd,17 Jan,How kind of you to help families. Have you checked craigslist for free items? Furniture should be easy finding and free.
3,174010975,Mariee Santistevan,‚Ä¢ Sunnyside,17 Jan,I recently worked with a Community resource navigator through Denver Health & I didn't know they reach out for items through Nextdoor?
4,174010975,Sarah Sheehan,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,17 Jan,I hope your experience with Denver Health was positive. I can‚Äôt speak to how Denver Health works specifically but I imagine you are correct about them not reaching out for things on Craigslist and Nextdoor. 
5,174010975,Connie Bake Wolfe,‚Ä¢ Woodland Valley 1,17 Jan,I have an older large iPad 2 you could have. It works fine just isn‚Äôt a new model. PM please.
6,174010975,Sarah Sheehan,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,17 Jan,"You just made my day!!!!! But to be hi eat more than that, these four little boys are going to flip their lids!!  I am putting together some of my kids‚Äô legos and going to bring them over this week. Virtual hug to you for making this happen and I will send you a photo of the kids so you can see their faces!!!"
7,174010975,Jessica Mitchell,‚Ä¢ City Park,17 Jan,"I have  baby boy clothes I am going to go through, if you'd lik3 I will message back all the sizes once I know what I have."
8,174010975,Sarah Sheehan,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,17 Jan,Thanks! Baby is a boy and turns 1 in February.
9,174010975,Jessica Mitchell,‚Ä¢ City Park,17 Jan,Kaitlyn Fravil....she's at the top of the home page giving away about 50 outfits for a baby boy
10,174010975,Sarah Sheehan,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,17 Jan,For some reason I can‚Äôt find her post. Would you possibly be able to DM her for me?
11,174010975,Adrianna Jimenez,‚Ä¢ Remington,18 Jan,Hi! How can I get active into this type of volunteering?
12,174010975,Sarah Sheehan,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,19 Jan,"Adrianna Jimenez hi! I will DM you and we can talk about how to get you started! I always welcome help personally but I can also connect you directly with other organizations depending on your time/interests.  If you have a heart and interest for helping your neighbor, you are greatly needed!  One-off opportunities to standing commitments and everything in between! Yay! Excited to connect!!"
13,174010975,Jessica Mitchell,‚Ä¢ City Park,18 Jan,I have some baby boy clothes that I found and will have more.. plenty of boxes will let you know when I'm done going through everything.
14,174010975,Kristana Kane,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,19 Jan,I used to volunteer for No One Left Behind helping former
15,174010975,Sarah Sheehan,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,19 Jan,I agree! Loveliest and hardest working families ever! Would love to get to know you and pick your brain! I am going to DM you now so we can connect. I would love your help with furnishing and getting these families set up.
16,174010975,Yenifer Salazar,‚Ä¢ Homestead Park,19 Jan,"Hi. I have some toys that my kids don't play with anymore, if you're interested. I also have some clothes, I will let you know the sizes as soon as I go thru them."
17,174010975,Sarah Sheehan,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,19 Jan,Yes please!!! I will DM you now! Really appreciate the help!
18,174010975,Sarah Sheehan,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,19 Jan,Hi Everyone! Thank you for all of the responses - both DM to me and to this post.  
19,174010975,Brett Schager,‚Ä¢ Wyco Park,20 Jan,"Sarah, has the family applied for public assistance on the Colorado PEAK website?"
20,174010975,Sarah Sheehan,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,21 Jan,"Yes! Both families have! Thank you, Brett!"
21,174010975,Brett Schager,‚Ä¢ Wyco Park,24 Jan,"Sarah, Providers Resource Clearinghouse used to provide furniture, but now they seem to be defunct.  Do you know of any other providers that give furniture?"
22,174010975,Zita Gallegos,‚Ä¢ Sunnyside,23 Jan,I can go through some of my sons toys and give them to you for the family.  This is amazing if you ‚ù§ please dm me if you still need anything.
0,154677621,Patty Blevins,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,13 Jul,So sad. üò™
1,154677621,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,13 Jul,It would be great to turn it into low-income housing.
2,154677621,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Jul,The cost would be prohibitive. It would also depreciate all the properties in the area. Personally I think it would be a poor idea.
3,154677621,ELAINE MARTIN,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Jul,Richard Boehm üëç
4,154677621,Mark Stenstrom,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Jul,The main Treat Hall is a national registered landmark so it won't be taken down thankfully.
5,154677621,David Akerson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Jul,"Anna Mccaffrey, i had the similar thought.  The worlds greatest homeless facility"
6,154677621,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Jul,As long as you live far enough away it does not depreciate your homes value.
7,154677621,Ben Miller,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jul,Richard Boehm yup
8,154677621,David Akerson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Jul,"Richard Boehm, I live 1/2 block away.  Johnson and Wales would have indoor apartments for every person, no tents or outdoor sleeping.  There are cafeterias, classrooms, shower and bathrooms, theatres.  Great for the city of Denver, a fantastic solution for our homeless issue"
9,154677621,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Jul,What I find interesting is your profile says you live on Glencoe a mile away and not a half block
10,154677621,David Akerson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Jul,An old profile that I haven't updated.  I live on Olive St. now in the 1700 block.
11,154677621,Donna Burrell,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Jul,Are there any thoughts about the property being declared a historical landmark? I have lived a block away for 40+ tears and there's so much history to protect.
12,154677621,David Akerson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Jul,See above Donna.  Apparently Treat Hall already is.  As for the rest of the campus....?
13,154677621,Gami Mattson,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,16 Jul,"Donna, I totally agree with you. I grew up 60+ years with it being Colorado Women‚Äôs College. It has a wonderful history."
14,154677621,Keegan Perkins,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jul,Affordable housing in those dorms would be helpful. I think it‚Äôs too early to know what will happen.
15,154677621,Kat Aguilar,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Jul,Maybe a community center for actual parkhill ?
16,154677621,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jul,As I was driving down Colorado Blvd I noticed that there are a couple of abandoned hotel. Also some of the hotels on Colfax. Should be cheap to remodel and use for homeless shelters
17,154677621,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,42w,"Sadly Richard those hotels are being sold to developers who are planning to build 12-story market-value apt buildings with no parking, which will be a new ring of hell to deal with. The neighbors are fighting it.  You are right about them being perfect for low-income housing though. There is no real long term plan to abate the homeless problem in the city.(edited)"
0,159002177,Nancy Arko,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Aug,Good that we know how she feels after all these years!  
1,159002177,Heather Smith-Hillman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,37w,"I couldn‚Äôt comment on the previous post as the ability to do so was shut down, perhaps by Nextdoor?  I was not surprised by this at all.  My husband and I worked with her when we sold our home in Hilltop in 2013 and she was totally unprofessional in every way.  I walked away from the entire experience feeling like we had just dealt with a very evil person. I always thought that at some point, karma would come back to haunt her, never imagining that it would involve theft and racism.(edited)"
2,159002177,Justin Retzlaff,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,37w,"Such a vile, ignorant person.  So disillusioned.  Has no idea that vilifying black lives matter and the homeless or mentally ill, IS the very America-hating that she wishes ‚Äúpeople‚Äù would stop.  She has so much disgust for what happens to actually be people exactly like herself.(edited)"
3,159002177,Keegan Perkins,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Aug,"I strive to move to understanding, compassion, and forgiveness. I don‚Äôt see that she did anything that can‚Äôt lead to those. She certainly isn‚Äôt single handedly responsible for disparities in housing and income. Sounds like she stole some signs. I can‚Äôt speak to what else. But if she makes amends, we should go forward. People make mistakes."
4,159002177,Justin Retzlaff,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,37w,"If she showed any remorse or leaning towards that direction, I‚Äôd agree.  But she continually defends her ignorant positions of BLM and the homeless being ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with Denver/America‚Äù.  I would gladly give credit to anyone ATTEMPTING to be a better person, which to date, she has not.(edited)"
5,159002177,Billy Rediess,‚Ä¢ Lowry,23 Aug,"Haven't we all seen this sort of dark side for years, however recently it is has become perfectly acceptable in society.  I wish her heart was different, but it's just not. We are who we are. I ask though for each of us, how can we be  better neighbors to one another, including those who don't have our hearts?"
6,159002177,cylie babcock,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,23 Aug,"You, sir, are a true gentleman. Maybe, we should all wish her a change of heart, not for her but as kind people we should want people to be their best."
7,159002177,Valerie Alford,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Aug,She broke 3 laws 1. She trespassed on private property 2. She stole private property 3. MOST IMPORTANT She tried to negate the owners 1st Amendment Right 
8,159002177,Dave Coldiron,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,23 Aug,I trust someone will be filing a complaint with the Real Estate Commission.  This kind of behavior makes all Realtors look bad and they should tolerate this criminality.
9,159002177,Mark Yaw,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,37w,"The one thing that mental health, education, law enforcement, and spiritual professionals will tell you with 100% certainty -- people with antisocial personalities never change. Because they can't. And so these individuals end up all alone, because people afflicted with compassion and empathy can't change, either.(edited)"
10,159002177,Anna Noble,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Aug,What‚Äôs scary is she was doing stuff like this for over 40 years before someone finally held her accountable.
11,159002177,Matthew Lee,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,24 Aug,"Anna Noble  I am NOT defending this lady's actions, but what are you talking about? Examples?"
12,159002177,Maren Jorgensen,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,23 Aug,Thanks for sharing Millete. Well said! We have to hold people accountable for their racism and bigotry!
13,159002177,Kiran Majid,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,23 Aug,Thank you for sharing.
14,159002177,marcia jones,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,23 Aug,Perhaps this relator - and other relators - should consider the fact that the neighborhood they're trying to protect doesn't need or want protecting.  Relators don't know the lives and opinions (except the posting of signs) of every resident.
15,159002177,Greg Petty,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,23 Aug,"I  certainly agree with the Millete's post.  the upsetting thing to me is how widespread views like hers are.  Until the past 4 years I had no idea how deep the resentment and racial bias was among so many whites.  I'd like to believe that if we change Presidents, we can start to have some reconciliation in the country that will lessen the bigotry and anger, especially of people on the far right."
16,159002177,Cristin Cochran,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,23 Aug,"I missed the earlier messaging on NextDoor but, per the Denver Post, it was that sharing that led to her termination.  I am proud to be part of this neighborhood that saw something wrong and did something about it.  Driving along Dahlia Street today from Alameda to 6th Avenue happy to see lots of BLM signs.  Also driving home from dinner last night past a homemade BLM sign on Monaco; my husband joked that the homeowner had to make his own sign out of steel and lumber to keep Denise from toting it off!"
17,159002177,John Bitzanakis,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Aug,"I totally agree what she did was wrong, but I don‚Äôt see one comment about the RIOTS downtown last night!!  I guess not important"
18,159002177,Tracy Shaffer,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,23 Aug,"Ms. Reich's actions not only disgrace the profession, they are illegal. Not only trespassing, theft, and tampering, there are also Fair Housing Laws and numerous ethical violations from National Association of Realtors. Her views, in my opinion, are abhorrent and I hope she is held accountable for her actions. She does not need my forgiveness, she needs counseling."
19,159002177,Deborah Stough,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Aug,I wonder if the real estate commision is looking into this?
20,159002177,Michele McManus,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,37w,"It has been over 20 years since I left that Re/Max office and the profession. However, I can tell you Denice Reich does not restrict her dislike to People of Color alone. Much like trump she had a reputation of screwing over fellow Realtors to get the sale. She was dishonest, mean, phony and only out for herself. I can attest to this not just by reputation but by personal experience. IMO she should lose her license. Otherwise, my guess is she will just open her own office. She is a cancer on the real estate industry and the community.(edited)"

26,159002177,Karen Ashmore,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,23 Aug,"Thank God we have realtors like you, Millete! I hope everyone who read your post calls you when they are ready to buy or sell a property. And refer other buyers/sellers to you. I know I will."
27,159002177,Jane Skarka,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,23 Aug,"I second that, Karen!"
28,159002177,John Bitzanakis,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Aug,I guess a stupid theft is more important then all the damage done to private and city property in downtown last night!!!  Let us keep quit like all the other cities
29,159002177,Dave Coldiron,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,23 Aug,calling out Reich's deplorable behavior doesn't justify the criminal behavior downtown.  We can condemn both. 
30,159002177,Judy Roybal,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,37w,"Lately, I talked to a ""long-time friend"" (re-evaluating) and was told that Black people were monkeys. I advised him to read about Darwin's theory - we all come from ""monkeys"". - Darwin's Theory Of Evolution"

I lived on Curtis Street across from the homeless shelter on 23rd & Curtis and yes, my car got broken into once, there was always trash around, and the alley always smelled like urine, BUT... I never looked at it being their fault. It is not their fault they are homeless. It is not their fault that they can‚Äôt get into a shelter because it‚Äôs safer on the streets than in a shelter. I met some very nice homeless individuals and ALL of them were trying to look for a job, but their interviews were far south in Englewood or Lakewood. They had no way to get to work even if they got the job. So please, stop complaining so much and be grateful that you are not homeless during a time like this."

22,154432154,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Jul,"Where are they all coming from. Are they displaced locals or transients? Personally I posted a couple of months back creating free camping grounds with toilets, water, showers and trash disposal. They don‚Äôt have to be in city proper. They could be relocated to these site and with free camping this would allow banning camping on sidewalks, parks, easements and along  roadways. This would allow social efforts to be concentrated to those areas and policed. I empathize but creating unsanitary, unstructured, health issues and potentially criminal sites is not an answer."

0,173867862,Robert Terrell,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,15 Jan,As many issues as you guys in that area are having I would invest in a security camera system. There are some relatively inexpensive systems out there. We moved from your area to Englewood and have cameras all around our home. The thugs are realizing this and have gradually started to stay away. Our videos turned over to the police have resulted in three arrests.
1,173867862,Jim Winski,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Jan,"In this particular block, the houses do not necessarily face the street. There are 3 single family home courtyards on the south side of the street, so only about 5 houses have a side yard that faces 29th Pl. On the north side of the street are a few sets of condos & townhomes and only a handful of those have a direct view of the street. We'd need to get cooperation from those few houses/condos that do face the street to set up cameras."
2,173867862,Anna Bellatorre,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Jan,"Yes, that is our situation. We do not face the street, so any cameras attached to our house or doorbell would not help with street crime. We did reach out to our neighbors with corner units to see if they had anything."
3,173867862,David Peterson,‚Ä¢ Bluff Lake,15 Jan,"Sorry this happened to you. Unfortunately, this is very common in Central Park. Most likely your husband left the door unlocked.

0,167881678,Julia Thornton,‚Ä¢ Quebec Parkway,14 Nov,People need to take this serious
1,167881678,Aman Ellis,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,25w,"Never go there again. Call 7/11 corporate and report. Also, in some states you can report covid protocol violations to a government run oversight group.(edited)"
2,167881678,Christa Osman,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Nov,Yeah...they obviously don't give a sh**...and need to be reminded why protocols are in place. I would say report it to the appropriate agency.
3,167881678,Jodie Alexander,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,15 Nov,Agree with Aman... email and call corporate. I did the same with another 7-11 ... I had a terrible experience and was told by a member of staff that they ‚Äòweren‚Äôt sweating it so I shouldn‚Äôt either‚Äô regarding masks and Covid. 
4,167881678,Aman Ellis,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,15 Nov,And potentially saving a life
5,167881678,Karen Urwin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,15 Nov,If you contact 311 they will take a report and pay a visit to the store.
6,167881678,Carleigh Combs,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,15 Nov,It's not just this location. I've been to multiple 711 locations all around Denver metro and between customers and employees there's always at least 1 person without a mask. And I'm not sure I've even seen hand sanitizer dispensers at any of the locations I've been to over the last few months. I know for a fact the one across from where I live does not have any. Are they supposed to?? I haven't stayed up to date with recommendations/ requirements since prior to summer  so I have no idea what businesses are supposed to be doing lol.
7,167881678,David Navarro,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,15 Nov,"Everywhere it seems people are wearing their mask under their nose if thats if their even wearing it at all. Walmart on Quebec, Walmart grocery on Havana and Colfax especially. Very SCARY times we live in."
8,167881678,Jean Tilley,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,15 Nov,Yea I've pretty much stopped going into stores because of employees and customers wearing their masks below their noses- which actually produces smaller droplets than your mouth! The anti maskers should take some of the blame for the poor economy by scaring customers away. I spend way more in person than when shopping online.
9,167881678,Lyndsey H.,‚Ä¢ Parkfield,15 Nov,"If your high risk, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be going out ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è."

11,167881678,Tim Farnum,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Nov,"Do you even hear yourselves? , ‚Äú report it to the government agency ‚Äú 1984 is closer than I ever could have imagined."
12,167881678,Matt L.,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,15 Nov,"Awfully close to wrongthink there, Tim.  Careful, you might get unpersoned."
13,167881678,Christa Osman,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Nov,This is public health. But nice try.
14,167881678,Lyndsey H.,‚Ä¢ Parkfield,15 Nov,"April H. How? She‚Äôs specifically saying she is high risk and doesn‚Äôt like how a store is handling the pandemic. Just my opinion but my sister, who is high risk, hasn‚Äôt left her house since March. So if you feel unsafe, stay in."
15,167881678,Christa Osman,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Nov,"It's more than just high risk people feeling unsafe. Why is this concept so difficult?  This is public health safety. Nothing about these regulations are difficult to uphold. Sanitizer? Plexi glass?  Masks? These are simple protocols.  Not hard. Why should anyone feel like businesses are disregarding simple protocols because they are lazy and disrespectful? Nope. Not acceptable.  This isn't acceptable for any other safety regulation put into place, and this situation is no different."
16,167881678,Juanita Villa,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,15 Nov,You don't have to be high risk. My brother who just turned 47  passed away just a week ago. His coworker had covid and refused to tell anyone at his job and unfortunately my brother got it and passed away. It's not a joke!
17,167881678,Lyndsey H.,‚Ä¢ Parkfield,15 Nov,"That‚Äôs really awful about your brother. My grandmother, who is 89, got it and got over it within 10 days. Didn‚Äôt even have to go to the hospital, just went to her PCP."
18,167881678,Juanita Villa,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,15 Nov,It is Lyndsy. He went to his pop as well and was sent home to quarantine. A few days later he was gasping for air and when his wife called the ambulance it was to late. His lungs failed and than his heart.
19,167881678,Joanne Stilwell,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Nov,So sorry Juanita. That is tragic.
20,167881678,Juanita Villa,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,15 Nov,Joanne Stilwell

25,167881678,Lyndsey H.,‚Ä¢ Parkfield,15 Nov,You should look into grocery delivery or click list. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing.
26,167881678,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,15 Nov,"All of my groceries have been delivered since March. With Amazon if you have a subscription like for free shipping or whatever you get your groceries delivered for free. If you have food stamps, you don't even need a subscription, you can get your groceries delivered for free through Amazon."
27,167881678,Julia Thornton,‚Ä¢ Quebec Parkway,15 Nov,I have very little money no credit cards
28,167881678,Lyndsey H.,‚Ä¢ Parkfield,15 Nov,You can use a debit card. Just saying there are ways for you to stay in your house. People have been doing it for 8 months now.
29,167881678,Julia Thornton,‚Ä¢ Quebec Parkway,15 Nov,You have to have 35.00 dollars worth of groceries for them to deliver I shop sales only so no it's not possible for everyone glad that you are able to do this but not everyone is so lucky

33,167881678,Carol Summerlin,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,15 Nov,Ugh!  I try to avoid all 7-11‚Äôs.

0,161329833,Susie Coffman,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,To me that is not hateful especially when you go to bed with gunshots and get woke up 5 hours later by a SWAT siren.
1,161329833,LInda Poletti,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Sep,I *think* Kevin was referring to Simone's post seeming hateful to the OP.  My read is that Simone telling Jennifer to go back to Stapleton seems hateful....
2,161329833,Tonia H.,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,I lived in that neighborhood for 50 years grew up with most of my Friends from Lowry Air Force Base. I have relocated to Lakewood..I couldn't handle it anymore and bullets don't have GPS. HOWS THAT BEING HATEFUL? ITS A REALLY BAD NEIGHBORHOOD.. NOW!!!!
3,161329833,Rob Key,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,34w,"No, it‚Äôs Simone Hammett-Lynch who‚Äôs being hateful. See above.(edited)"

5,161329833,Susie Coffman,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,And in NM away from everything on a Mesa
6,161329833,Jennifer Ward,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,"One person directly messaged me and suggested to setup a neighborhood watch for your immediate area. The thought is, it can serve as a small deterrent but also when the entire area has one already and we still have the same level of incedents, then hopefully the city will get more focused on doing something."
7,161329833,Rob Key,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,"Yeah, I tried initiating a NW for my neighborhood and no one seemed to want to give time or take action. Only lip service."
8,161329833,David Navarro,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,14 Sep,"I've lived here about 33+ years and it's the best I've seen.  Keep viligent of yourselves and your neighbors, keep a loaded gun handy and ready to protect your family because sometimes the police will not be there to defend you. (I've seen it take up to 50+ min for the police to respond when it's serious, no fault of the police, they just have alot to do in this area.) This area used to be 100x worse from today for sure"
9,161329833,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,"I agree about being prepared to defend yourself. Things can happen in a quarter of a second. No police, no matter how diligent, can ever be on site  quick enough to respond to that."
10,161329833,David Navarro,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,14 Sep,Aurora Pd has done a remarkable job.
11,161329833,Angie Valdez,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,"We are in Denver though. The incidents that took place last night happened around 16th and Uinta, Valencia"

15,161329833,Susie Coffman,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,I didn't think so just safer there.
16,161329833,Kirk Wayland,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,14 Sep,Colfax is a never-ending circus train. It's edgy and sometimes sketchy but I'll take it over some whitewashed strip mall in suburbia. The crime statistics along Colfax are fairly typical of any major transit artery in a metropolitan area. Just keep your wits about you and cultivate some street smarts in those kids.
17,161329833,Simone Hammett-Lynch,‚Ä¢ Aurora,14 Sep,amen
18,161329833,LInda Poletti,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Sep,"Jennifer, I applaud you. Thank you for posting and for trying to make a difference.  Keep moving in this direction, you will make an impact.    Ignore the sarcastic comment, the helpers will shine.  And yes, many thanks to APD and DPD from me and my family!"
19,161329833,Sherrie Kroemer,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,I've lived in this neighborhood for 20 years. This is the worst it's been. I would be for having think tank meetings to fix it.
20,161329833,Gloria BURNS,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,"what i am about to say is not to cause a debate, but we are living in a different time people don't think the same way.years ago people share they look out for each others,so we have to do the best we can try as hard as we can to protect our selves and the people around us,watch and see it's not going to get better.man had over sis thousand years to get it right is he improving? at this time some one with real power is getting ready to make a change.it's not just one part of the earth that is having problems it's all over the world !!!"
21,161329833,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,"Not sure I understand this ""man had over sis"" and ""someone with real power is getting ready to make a change"". What does that mean? Who is ""someone with real power""? What are you alluding to?"
22,161329833,Gloria BURNS,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,GOD IS THE ONE WITH THE REAL POWER
23,161329833,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,Oh.
24,161329833,Catherine Tenedios,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,"Jennifer - thank you so much for posting this question an acknowledging the systemic problems as I think about this often . How can peoples lives be safe on all levels while acknowledging privilege and the real fear that comes with the frequency of gun shots . I don‚Äôt have any answers yet , educating  myself on systemic oppression and how I perpetuate it . I am aware I am opening up myself to negativity by even posting a comment . Please let me know if a neighborhood watch gets started and what our roles would be ."
25,161329833,Tracy Urban,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,We hear you that‚Äôs why we are going to move.  Not a kid-friendly neighborhood unfortunately
26,161329833,LInda Poletti,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Sep,I don't think moving is always an option for people so posts like that aren't really helpful to this thread.
27,161329833,Angie Valdez,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,What's your suggestion for helping to add to this thread?
28,161329833,Amy Heaton,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Sep,"Hey, Jennifer. I would be totally on boars with joining with you. I will send you my email and phone number. Thanks for your post."
29,161329833,Kim LaClair,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,Have you voiced your opinions at the East Colfax Neighborhood Association https://www.eastcolfaxneighborhood.org/ meetings? 
30,161329833,Jennifer Ward,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Sep,"To be honest this was an impulse post and I don't regularly get on Nextdoor until the last week or so.  I am aware there is an East Colfax neighborhood association and I certainly plan to get more involved and was hoping to hear from them on this thread.  I also have not yet contacted our councilwoman as I was hoping to find others who feel the same way and approach as a group, since there is generally more power in numbers.  My main goal from this post was to find some hope that maybe something can be done, even if it only makes a tiny difference.  And I personally have no intentions on moving, as l still love my neighborhood and we personally have not felt threatened."

3,169684073,Deb Moss,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,4 Dec,Just this afternoon at the Hoffman Heights dollar store a girl was nicely asked to leave her backpack at the front of the store.  She left the store using awful language and a yelling match resulted in the parking lot.
4,169684073,Robbin Eldredge,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,5 Dec,This is a huge issue all over the metro area right now. Expect your car insurance to go up and be smart and diligent.
0,157869104,Jarrod Allen,‚Ä¢ Aurora,13 Aug,Unfortunately I was able to get video camera footage and within 30 seconds of the wallet falling out of my pocket a homeless woman picked it up and took off with it. She had obviously seen me drop it.

He will hook you up!  Also thats easily repaired just with a tubeless tire plug, take you like 5 min but you need a compressor or some kind of air, Just pull out the screw and stick in the plug with the tool it comes with & your done-  Advanced Auto carries them as Walmart, etc. . . Kits about $5-6 but you can repair like 10 tires with one kit.  (I have one of them & they work great for repairing your own tire, (Most tires you dont even have to take off vehicle!)(edited)"

We have called the cops but they said there is nothing we can do. He scares us. He is thin, Caucasian with black greying short hair."
5,158777140,David Aba,‚Ä¢ Lowry,21 Aug,"He did not threaten me or point at me like he was holding a weapon, but, this does sound like the same person based on your description and experience."
6,158777140,Angela Krauss,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,21 Aug,Let the police and apartment manager know about this. Isabella Thalles died because of an incident that started out this way.üò™
7,158777140,Melody Hodges,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,21 Aug,That's why I'm surprised the cops said there was nothing they could do.... My impression from the news stories was this was exactly how the incident that resulted in Isabella Thalles death began.  Maybe talk to an attorney?  Perhaps he needs a mental health intervention.
8,158777140,Susan Puccio,‚Ä¢ Central Park,21 Aug,"Melody Hodges he hasn‚Äôt broken any laws ( if he threatens or assaults ahuman the police could do something). this is why people are asking for mental health folks to work with the police dept.  police are not trained to assess, mental health is! so don‚Äôt say ‚Äú defund the police- say ‚Äú Add/ support ‚Äú support the PD with mental health!"
9,158777140,Cathy Bann,‚Ä¢ South Hilltop,21 Aug,Just report him to the police and have them talk to him so crazy that people are going nuts
10,158777140,Jane Salland,‚Ä¢ Lowry,37w,"The cops told me to call them so they could have a conversation with him and in addition to the cop that came out, the community resource officer called me to talk about it. But the cops never have come in time to see him.(edited)"
11,158777140,David Aba,‚Ä¢ Lowry,21 Aug,Thanks for the thoughtful comments. My wife and I will see what we can do with building management for that condo complex. If it happens again I‚Äôll record the experience with my phone - then call the police.
12,158777140,Debbi GreerEdick,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,21 Aug,"People like this can be very mean.  Please watch your pup carefully, if you live close to this person."
13,158777140,Jane Salland,‚Ä¢ Lowry,21 Aug,"Yes, he told us he could break our dog's neck"
14,158777140,Bill Horowitz,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,21 Aug,Call police last guy did that (business owner lived downtown) ended up pulling a weapon on innocent people walking dogs .It's not your lawn anyway. And if it's HOA even more reason to stfu! But just writing.
15,158777140,Sharon Berthrong,‚Ä¢ Lowry,21 Aug,i always pretend I am hard of hearing and ignore the idiot.
16,158777140,Susan Puccio,‚Ä¢ Central Park,21 Aug,i think the more calls ( to get concerns documented) would help in getting help for this man plus protection for others.
17,158777140,Susan Puccio,‚Ä¢ Central Park,21 Aug,"there used to be a man who walked sand creek trail who was very afraid of dogs( many dog walkers on this trail) and would yell and pull out his phone and pretend? to call the cops on us.  i could tell he was afraid but he was pretty scary too. often, people hide their fear with anger. Haven‚Äôt seen him for over a year now but he was scary."
18,158777140,Donna Regan,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,21 Aug,"If the man is mentally ill, why call the police. If they did arrest him they would take him to Denver Health for an evaluation and soon be released. NO ONE can force him to take meds. Be thankful your not one of his neighbors."
19,158777140,Jan H.,‚Ä¢ Lowry,21 Aug,"The fact that he is behaving this way, does not mean that he has a severe mental illness nor does it mean that he cannot be helped by a therapist or other support services without medications. It does not even imply what kind of mental health diagnosis, he has, if any."
20,158777140,Donna Regan,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,22 Aug,Jan Holland-Beachley I should not have assumed. I‚Äôve been involved with homeless men for 17 years. Of course there are resources out there to numerous to mention here. The bottom line is he‚Äôs in control weather he chooses to seek or reach out for help.
21,158777140,Deb Montour,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,21 Aug,"Time for the peace force, i guess. I hope he has been reported"
22,158777140,Kimberley Galbraith,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,21 Aug,Don't respond...he may have some level of mental illness.  Just leave him alone and think nothing of it! üòÄ
23,158777140,Avi Ancel,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,21 Aug,The man is obviously mentally ill. I strongly suggest you call the police - and the sooner the better. Remember that man down town denver that shot the couple and killed the woman a month ago? Call the police please. Avi
24,158777140,Nadia Garcia,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,21 Aug,"Be careful with crazy people like that, remember what happened not to long ago downtown to the couple that were walking their dog üòî Hope the cops do something about that"
25,158777140,Bell Sands,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,21 Aug,Yikes!  True.
26,158777140,IsaacRay Gomez,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,21 Aug,"He tried gettin slick with me once! Yelling all kinds of profanities at me an my dogs. I told him to come down to say it up close to my face, he just muttered something about police."
27,158777140,Avi Ancel,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,21 Aug,Why didn't you call the police?
28,158777140,Jim Askins,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,21 Aug,Tell the police he's not wearing pants and yelling profane things at you.
29,158777140,Mary Flower,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,22 Aug,Don't lie to the police!
30,158777140,Jim Askins,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,22 Aug,Mary Flower relax. It's sarcasm. Life might be a lot more enjoyable if you lighten up. Seems to be a common theme on ND.

5,158794076,Barbara D.,‚Ä¢ Central Park,21 Aug,Is that your lawn or an easement?  Wouldn't that be trespassing?
6,158794076,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,21 Aug,The police had them move the bikes and suitcases off our fence line and that was that
7,158794076,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,21 Aug,"If you suspect illegal activity,  why don‚Äôt you call 311 and have it investigated?  Maybe if they knew they were being watched then they might leave. Or at least stop.  Where do you live?"
8,158794076,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,21 Aug,Yes Kristen I have already gone the 311 and 911 route. For a week they show up and nothing gets done. I didn‚Äôt just hop on ND and state this without contacting authorities.

10,158794076,Karin Schumacher,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,21 Aug,"PLEASE contact Chris Herndon, City Councilperson for help.  This situation is unexplainable and unacceptable. What are the cops telling you?  If necessary, contact one of the news stations to come and take photos and put it on the news.  I bet lots of people are looking for their stolen items. (Why can't the police match the bikes to the IDs that folks have registered as stolen?) Further the police can set up a watch/surveillance to see if/when drug deals are going down."
11,158794076,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,21 Aug,"The police quite literally never even looked through the pickup. There were a good 10 bikes in it and they didn‚Äôt even question it.

1,158985611,Frank Barnhart,‚Ä¢ Aurora,23 Aug,No clue. The lady that was next to me at the light was talking on the phone with them.
2,158985611,Jay Yoakam,‚Ä¢ Aurora,23 Aug,Only 3 Caucasian allowed or they are considered a gang.
3,158985611,Brian Plummer,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Aug,Naaa that‚Äôs called a entitlement

6,158985611,Nicole Ryan,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Aug,Why did someone waste their time calling the cops
7,158985611,Frank Barnhart,‚Ä¢ Aurora,23 Aug,Who knows. Maybe the lady who called it in was having a bad day.
8,158985611,Abeth Parisian,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Aug,Maybe it was her golf cartüòâ
9,158985611,Mitchell Eisenberg,‚Ä¢ Aurora,23 Aug,I have been seeing an increase in golf carts recently...did something change that more people bought them?
10,158985611,Frank Barnhart,‚Ä¢ Aurora,23 Aug,Its probably the golf cart parked behind noodles and company dumpsters
11,158985611,Brian Plummer,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Aug,They were at Starbucks in a no parking zone around 1130. I‚Äôve seen them blow through stop signs on 29th more than once. Last week there were 7 of them in the cart with two of them standing on the back bumper.
12,158985611,Bryan VZ,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Aug,"Plus they are underage,  too many for the amount of seats, not wearing seatbelts,  disregarding the rules of the road, and are usually drinking alcohol while driving."
13,158985611,Dwight Thompson,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Aug,What they are doing is illegal. They need to be fined and the parents reprimanded
14,158985611,Scott Carlson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Aug,"I don‚Äôt think you need an actual license for one of these do you?  Personally, I would treat it like kids on bikes riding in the streets - Those also blow through stop signs and disobey laws all the time.  If the kids get hurt then it is their issue to deal with - but if they aren‚Äôt hurting you perhaps the ‚Äúnanny state‚Äù should let them be???"
15,158985611,Chris Barnett,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Aug,Didn‚Äôt realize the number of Karens that lived here
16,158985611,Chris Barnett,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Aug,I‚Äôm sure you all did some kinda hoodrat stuff as a teenager and if you didn‚Äôt then I really don‚Äôt trust your mayonnaise judgment anyway.

19,158985611,Dwight Thompson,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Aug,"I did stupid stuff as a kid. I got caught and faced the consequences. It's part of growing up. I nearly hit then the other day while they blew a red light. And using ""Karen"" in this instance shows how little you understand about that term and why it was created. If this was black kids, they'd already be in jail. And yeah, the so-called ""nanny"" state needs to get involved because sooner rather than later, they are going to cause real damage. And to answer even more of your uneducated questioning: YES, IT IS ILLEGAL TO DRIVE A MOTORIZED VEHICLE WITHOUT A LICENSE."
20,158985611,Scott Carlson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Aug,That you for liberating me from uneducatedness.  So I guess my kid‚Äôs battery operated skateboard is illegal then too by that bolded definition.  And the electric car for 6+ year kids right?

22,158985611,Chez Dyas,‚Ä¢ Bluff Lake,37w,So... Are you good with golf carts as long as they meet all the Low Speed Vehicle requirements and follow all street sign and other driving law?(edited)
23,158985611,Dwight Thompson,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Aug,"Absolutely. In this case, following  the law would keep them from a bad accident. Plus, having to go through getting a driver's license will reach them some much needed ethics in driving in public."
24,158985611,John Dahmer,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Aug,"Holy $hit, the cops we‚Äôre called on 4 little girls in a golf cart? I see those girls all the time and they are never a bother nor is it any reason to call the police. People are pathetic. Truly pathetic."
25,158985611,Dwight Thompson,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Aug,"You've been lucky. I didn't call the cops when I nearly hit them, but they nearly died when they ran that light in my instance. I've seen multiple threads on here about them nearly getting hit. If they had a license and followed the law, I'd see no problem, but clearly they are not."
26,158985611,Ellie Carringan,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Aug,"none of them are even close to 16 from what i have seen. they are clearly not supposed to be driving, especially in a vehicle not made for streets"
27,158985611,Chez Dyas,‚Ä¢ Bluff Lake,23 Aug,"Anyone checked their age and if the golf cart is street legal? Or are we just assuming things here? There are such things as street legal golf carts. If the driver has a license too, then this may all just be one big misunderstanding."
28,158985611,Corey Hopes,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Aug,Cops were called.. and rant was made online the next day. (I have nothing better to do)

6,168215855,Vivian VanArsdale,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,18 Nov,I have a little 7 lb toy poodle who is a Houdini. I walk the perimeter as a security guard and I have no clue how she can possibly get out of the yard. I'm to the point now I take her with me everywhere because I can't leave her alone at home unless I lock her in the bathroom which I have had to do.
7,168215855,Melody Hodges,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,18 Nov,"I had a Houdina once.... I never could figure out how she got out of the yard.  She also managed to get out of her collars (plural) so I got her a harness but she got out of that, too.  I still haven't found them, and it's been years.  I can't figure out what she did with them.

When he reached us he just stared at my dogs. They're small dogs between 11 and 19 lbs. He finally looked up and asked me if I would sell him my bigger dog for $10. I told him he wasn't for sale and he moved on. Maybe he just wanted a companion but It just gave me a weird vibe."

31,168376079,Perla Mendoza,‚Ä¢ Central Park,24w,It does and it is a learning lesson for everyone. But right now it‚Äôs more about how we can be there for one another as a community. She‚Äôs just asking kindly for help and if you are able to help out than kindly do so. We are not here to make people feel bad more than they already are.(edited)

2,155315516,Stephen Milner,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,19 Jul,Did you get a timely response? Are the people ok? Did you see or hear anything before the shots?
3,155315516,Rob Juarez,‚Ä¢ Lowry,19 Jul,I was on hold with 911 for about 30 sec but ambulance and police arrived pretty fast. The victim was conscious when taken by EMTs.
4,155315516,Ginny Lupo,‚Ä¢ Lowry,19 Jul,"Robyn, it is traumatic to witness something like that.  I believe DPD has psychologists or similar who are available to witnesses who need a little help processing.  I‚Äôm sure this experience is all you‚Äôll be able to think about for awhile.  It sounds like you did the right thing calling 911 and staying nearby (hope you didn‚Äôt feel like you were in danger).  Take care of yourself too now."

16,155315516,Susy Halloran,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,19 Jul,I totally agree.
17,155315516,Ray Tug,‚Ä¢ Lowry,19 Jul,Great point.  Passion runs deep these days and so does feeling like a person has to defend their position or stance.  Easy to get off topic when emotions are charged.
18,155315516,Yvonne Gardea,‚Ä¢ Lowry,19 Jul,"I agree, I just feel that the leasing DEPT ought to send out an email as to how there handling this, so we can feel safe in this complex"
19,155315516,Rob Juarez,‚Ä¢ Lowry,19 Jul,I was surprised to see that the police did not tape anything off and any investigating was quick and short. They just looked around with flashlights and were gone.
20,155315516,Ana Azmitia,‚Ä¢ Woodside Village,19 Jul,I saw in the CBS this morning that the gun shots were in Alameda and Fairmount?
21,155315516,Judy Tisdale,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,19 Jul,I heard from a reliable source that there was a double shooting at 8500 E Alameda last nite.  I think that is Woodside Village.  There were many shootings last nite in the metro area.

0,176209324,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,7 Feb,Some? How about the vast majority of neighborhoods think this specific plan is very flawed and needs to be readdressed with some equity and no special interests on the design team.
1,176209324,Dana S.,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,7 Feb,"More than 80% of every Denver neighborhood strongly opposed this insane bill in the Fall, forcing city council to withdraw passing it. This version is still not acceptable. Council clearly is still failing to hear that they Wirker for us and are supposed to represent our needs and desires."
2,176209324,Susan C.,‚Ä¢ University Park,7 Feb,"This GLA is really just changing the ordinance to make money for entities like Queen City Cooperative, other density developers and corrections companies. I mean look who sat on the GLA planning group and pulled Hancock‚Äôs, City Council‚Äôs and Webb‚Äôs strings for two years. And Sarah Wells and the others living at the coop on Cap Hill are Queen City‚Äôs shills..."
3,176209324,Julio T.,‚Ä¢ Alamo Placita,9 Feb,"Queen City Cooperative is literally just some people who live in one house who want to be legally allowed to do so. They aren't developers or anything like that at all. I know who they are and literally they are like teachers, artists, a web developer. They are a chosen family who want to legally be allowed to live like one and want to allow other chosen families to be allowed the same."

7,176209324,Ben E.,‚Ä¢ Highland,7 Feb,"How the hell is this what's going to damage neighborhoods? You wanna know why people are living together? It's because they're broke and group living is efficient and more affordable. Maybe if by ""damage"" you mean lower the median income - in that case, you're the problem, not the ordinance."
8,176209324,Dana S.,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,7 Feb,"Ben I would hope everyone can understand you valid point. At the same time, city council members are elected by the residents of Denver and their neighborhood. Their job is to serve the people. Over 80% strongly opposed this proposal and that hasn‚Äôt changed. The majority of Denver has spoken and it is council‚Äôs job to listen."

14,176209324,Cheryl Shoup,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,7 Feb,We are very opposed to this also. The parking on our street is bad enough now.  We have 4 houses just on our end of the block that have numerous people living in one house and they have between 5 & 10 cars at each house.
15,176209324,Julio T.,‚Ä¢ Alamo Placita,9 Feb,"Yes and now they are legally allowed to live there, so why don't you mind your own business? Because guess what, you don't own the parking in front of your house."
16,176209324,Christine H.,‚Ä¢ City Park West,9 Feb,one small reason i don't own a car. i'm in deeply dense city park west and several of my neighbors are car-less. it can be done. i realize it doesn't work for everyone.
17,176209324,Ryk M.,‚Ä¢ Hampden,7 Feb,When I see comments on this subject I'm reminded of a quote by the famous Dr. Peter Venkman: ‚ÄúHuman sacrifice! Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!‚Äù
18,176209324,Ryk M.,‚Ä¢ Hampden,7 Feb,"Paige Burkeholder - Wow! Not a single accusation that you just levied at me is true, and I challenge you to show otherwise or retract what you said. If the amendment passes, the only thing I'll be doing is NOT worrying about my property's value, my safety, or my neighborhood's character. You know as well as I do that just because someone supports the amendment, it doesn't mean that they need to do anything personally to help the people who will be helped by it -- no more than you would need to do something personally if you were advocating for, say, extra funding for policing. It's a policy change, not a crusade."
19,176209324,Ryk M.,‚Ä¢ Hampden,9 Feb,"As you can see, she removed her comment, part of which accused me of calling her a white, privileged woman. My conversations with her were were always civil, and I think that I just got under her skin by continually correcting her misinformation."
20,176209324,Paige Burkeholder,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park East,13w,Here is more information that the City hasn‚Äôt shared:  https://us17.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=5d2c19537162f3f275a0316fa&id=c599bec59d
21,176209324,Kathleen M.,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,7 Feb,"No one has mentioned another main concerns, halfway houses for drug/criminal/other facilities to be set up throughout the city.  Now they are concentrated near downtown or by correctional facilities.  City Council wants more options where to put them, regardless of bus routes, job availability or easy access to meetings."
22,176209324,Julio T.,‚Ä¢ Alamo Placita,9 Feb,This isn't true...halfway houses would only be allowed along commercial corridors.
23,176209324,Jeannine S.,‚Ä¢ Cook Park,8 Feb,It‚Äôs only fair the City should be allowed more options! Why should low income parts of town  always be the ones to get these type of places!?
24,176209324,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Feb,any updates here?
25,176209324,Courtney Copp,‚Ä¢ University Hills,9 Feb,It passed 11-2!

27,176209324,Rita R.,‚Ä¢ Yosemite-Cherry Creek Townhomes,9 Feb,Well good news or bad news it passed 11 to 2.  So I guess we will see.
28,176209324,CJ Steffen,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Feb,i thought 80% strongly opposed the measure?
29,176209324,Julio T.,‚Ä¢ Alamo Placita,9 Feb,So happy that City Council did the right thing! Not the only solution to Denver's affordability issues but a much needed step in providing equity throughout the city.

26,169715464,Deslie Mernedakis,‚Ä¢ Old Thornton,22w,"I am not incapable of helping, i can use  my time to help. I can cook for a family who needs a break. I can help with my time at night as long As It is safe for me and my son.. i will rise up.(edited)"
27,169715464,Yazmin Saenz,‚Ä¢ Wandering View,5 Dec,"Just an idea, you could make some type of Christmas ornaments, center pieces, decorations, and sell them! There are a lot of free Christmas items in the free/for sale section! Good Luck!"
28,169715464,Deslie Mernedakis,‚Ä¢ Old Thornton,7 Dec,"Yazmin Saenz that is a great Idea. But i want to be honest, i cannot add more stress and things to do on my plate right now. Maybe something extra i can do in the summer for bazarre sales. I will try to sell what I have at the house to temporarily help me. Then make extra job or crafts to sell."

0,182533178,Emma Griffis,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,6 Apr,This is awesome!
1,182533178,Lane O‚ÄôConnor,‚Ä¢ Hale,6 Apr,Heck yeah! This is wonderful!
0,156795564,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,2 Aug,My opinion:
1,156795564,Darlene Hurley,‚Ä¢ Happy Canyon,2 Aug,The problem with the state doing it is that they can't get their own computer programs to work. Look at how often everything is down in the state. You would never have any internet service if they were doing it.
2,156795564,James L.,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill SW,2 Aug,"Yes, the law was rammed through by telecom lobbyists to make it harder for anyone to compete with them. Those communities that HAVE won locally (Longmont is one exqmple) have seen business growth and consumer satisfaction."
3,156795564,Patrick Payne,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,2 Aug,Not just Denver but the state. The internet should be a public utility
4,156795564,Cindy Gioffredi,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,2 Aug,"Internet as a public utility would allow the powers that be to monitor ALL our private info, etc. Not for me."
5,156795564,Mark Halfhill,‚Ä¢ Washington Park East,2 Aug,Those days are long past. Your cellular posting is monitored as well.
6,156795564,Lisa R.,‚Ä¢ Platt Park,40w,"If you use Google, Apple, or Amazon they already have very bit of private information about you."
7,156795564,Robert W.,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,2 Aug,They need to make it so cable companies have to compete with each other versus only one in each state.
8,156795564,Anna McCaffery,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,2 Aug,Multiple competitors with a requirement for a basic level so that all school children get it for free to do homework.
9,156795564,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,2 Aug,Comcast and CenturyLink certainly don‚Äôt prove that private enterprise is the best solution to providing what has become an essential service
10,156795564,Traci Hannah,‚Ä¢ DIA,2 Aug,"of course not, let companies do what they do best, the City has enough on its plate, this seems silly but i may be missing something.  (25years in telecom)"
11,156795564,June Schumacher,‚Ä¢ Dartmouth Heights,3 Aug,Very true.  The city can‚Äôt even manage the city.
12,156795564,June Schumacher,‚Ä¢ Dartmouth Heights,3 Aug,No
13,156795564,Ron T.,‚Ä¢ Baker,3 Aug,No
14,156795564,T.A. O.,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,3 Aug,Good grief! Something else the City can screw up
15,156795564,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,3 Aug,"i don‚Äôt know that private enterprise will ever make an essential service equitable, but would folks support rules to make internet services a truly competitive market?"
16,156795564,Aimee Rullo,‚Ä¢ Skyland,4 Aug,I disagree with this statement. I'm in telecom (and have been for a long time) and my sole job is to sell to small ISPs. There are a TON! Even in Denver. You just need to look them up.
17,156795564,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,4 Aug,"Aimee Rullo i know there are a few small ISPs left; the ones that survived have found niches, such as Forethought that has its own cable in parts of downtown, and focuses primarily on full service business accounts"
18,156795564,Chris C.,‚Ä¢ Hampden South,3 Aug,No
19,156795564,Ann Brannan Joyce,‚Ä¢ Holly Hills,3 Aug,No!
20,156795564,Charlie H.,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,3 Aug,"It works in Fort Collins, it can and should absolutely be done here."
21,156795564,Charles Telles,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,3 Aug,"Denver isn't capable of taking care of anything presently and they think they can run this, what a joke. The state isn't anymore capable. Our governor didn't even know there was a homeless camp right outside his windiw."
22,156795564,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,3 Aug,"the ballot issue in question wouldn‚Äôt set up a city internet service, it would just cancel a state prohibition on doing so; that prohibition is a strategic obstacle put in place in 2005"
23,156795564,Tanner Axt,‚Ä¢ Wash Park West,4 Aug,Yes! Give me municipal broadband and someone who I can hold accountable in an election if everything isn't working!
24,156795564,Chandler Sinclair,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Aug,"Yes! Look what a tiny town in Chattanooga,TN was able to pull off by taking their internet public: https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/15/9543839/chattanooga-tennessee-just-found-out-its-getting-the-fastest-internet"
25,156795564,John W.,‚Ä¢ Hampden South,4 Aug,"Yes! Something needs to be done about the availability and quality of internet access not only here but country wide. The government and Ajit Pai have stopped competition from ISP‚Äôs thereby guaranteeing higher prices and lower quality from the provider(s) in your area. Look at Europe and major developed countries and see what kind of internet speed, pricing and quality they have, it puts our country to shame. We need to start somewhere and this is as good a place as any."
0,167939063,Bev Laughlin,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,15 Nov,I don't shop there for that reason.  Hate how they refigured the store.
1,167939063,Abeth Parisian,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,15 Nov,Agree. The new updated layout makes absolutely no sense. Even workers hate it.
2,167939063,Shannon Stevenson,‚Ä¢ Skyland,15 Nov,"They were very active about social distance, but now it seems about everybody is getting relaxed about covid. I work in healthcare and I'm glad to see n hear that some ppl are still practicing social distance. Big thank you."
3,167939063,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,15 Nov,That King Sooper is horrible for everything. I used to live in Mayfair and avoided that store like the plague. Now that may be literal.
4,167939063,Gabriela Carrion,‚Ä¢ Hale,15 Nov,The name says it all: SAFE-way!üòÇ
5,167939063,Stephanie Schilken,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Nov,"Yeah, I switched to Safeway too for the same safety concerns."
6,167939063,Joan Beam,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Nov,"Safeway is clean and safe, aisle directions, social distancing spacing.  That Mayfair King Sooper is the exact opposite - I will not shop there."
7,167939063,Maricela Sanchez,‚Ä¢ Hale,15 Nov,"I dont shop there anymore I go to the leetsdale one and there's alot of people there too üòí can barely go thru aisles, I agree tho with the safeway krameria there's not a lot people there looks pretty clean too"
8,167939063,Carol Hunter,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Nov,They‚Äôve been erratic for months. Let Kroger corporate know. We feel safe at Trader Joe‚Äôs and Sprouts especially the new one in Central Park.  I compliment them every time I go.
9,167939063,Julie Reusser,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Nov,Totally agree with Trader Joe‚Äôs- they are wonderful!
10,167939063,Lulu Dorner,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,16 Nov,"Yeah! Trader Joe‚Äôs is the best! Clean, safe and the associates always very helpful and respectful! üëçüèº"
11,167939063,Sherry Stevenson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Nov,We haven‚Äôt shopped King Sooper for months now.  They were slack at the time when it began.   We love Trader Joe‚Äôs/Sprouts we always feel safe there and the Safeway in Lowry. We only shop there the products we cannot purchase at TJ/Sprouts.
12,167939063,Joanne Spillman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Nov,"Isn't Safeway more expensive? I could be wrong, though. I admit the Safeway in Mayfair is cleaner and more spread out than KS, though."
13,167939063,Andrew Sweet,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Nov,Ditto to all the above.  I go to KS at 6-7 am on weekday.  Only way it makes any sense.  Safeway seems much better. Just need to break thirty years habit!!
14,167939063,Tim Townsend,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,15 Nov,Sounds like a great question for King Soopers management.
15,167939063,Joanne Spillman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Nov,"They don't care. I know plenty of people have complained, but nothing ever changes."
16,167939063,Josh Joshua,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,15 Nov,"In this election year, we can vote with our feet. I like Safeway on Quebec and 1st. Immaculate and well organized."
17,167939063,Sandra Stangle,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Nov,I would also recommend NOT doing curbside pickup at the Mayfair King Sooper.  The last time I did curbside they gave me less than half of my order but charged me for everything.  It took three weeks to get my money refunded.  This included going through their corporate office.  Since that time I have done curbside pickup at the south Monaco location with no problems.  I am thinking of switching to Safeway or Walmart for my curbside orders.
18,167939063,Carol Fields,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,16 Nov,"I have had no problem at all with pickup at King Sooper Mayfair.   When they substitute, they charge the lower price."
19,167939063,Nicole Montoya,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,15 Nov,I was there today and notice the same thing its irritating
20,167939063,Jon Honegger,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Nov,I once watched a guy blast a farmers blow out onto the floor in the entrance. No one even flinched.....
21,167939063,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,15 Nov,I üíØ believe that‚Äôs true
22,167939063,Kevin Finnerty,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Nov,Social distancing seems to have ended the day that masks started.
23,167939063,Robin Howe,‚Ä¢ Hale,15 Nov,That store has been a train wreck since Jack left
24,167939063,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,15 Nov,We should report them to the Department of Health they will be closed down.
25,167939063,Kevin Finnerty,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,15 Nov,Health department doesn't care. There's a store in town with 12 confirmed cases & they list it as 2 & do absolutely nothing.
26,167939063,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,16 Nov,Really? I know Tri-County Health certainly does. If you report it they go directly to the store
27,167939063,Stephanie Bean,‚Ä¢ City Park,15 Nov,"I ordered from them for pick up occasionally as previous order fulfillments have been lacking.  I do the Target drive up in Glendale, it quick and easy.  If they don‚Äôt have what I ordered, I know ahead of time and can figure it out. I‚Äôm doing my best to stay away from people as we have a kid and a baby and can‚Äôt get sick and parent at the same time!"

0,182862073,Nora Kathy Beales,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,8 Apr,Trigger point massage therapy can help. I have no one to recommend but I did the massage on myself and know it works. As well a chiropractor could help.

Shots hear in my alley, called 911, 3am, ambul took him off, police show at 4, detectives swarming neighborhood. fingerprints and search vehicle, said vic is alive, but 3 in the body. Very Scary. The police have been around all day, the alley is becoming a murderer's row. lots of dope, scary people, homeless, trash, Enough to make me a God believer, but thank God I'm an atheist."

11,160485557,Janice McGuire,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 Sep,It was a busy night for the police.  Gunshots near Batavia (1650) and Quince about 2:15 a.m. We called police.
12,160485557,Margaret Myers,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,7 Sep,I heard 6 shots at 4:45 am Monday morning. Close to Colfax and Monaco.
13,160485557,LInda Poletti,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Sep,"Hi Margaret. We heard the shots fired (exact time/ 5-6 shots) you mention at 17th and Monaco. It was the day AFTER the alley incident on 9/6 where someone was shot. We called the police and then scanned next door all day but never saw anything about it on next-door so we started to think that we dreamed it, or that it was fireworks.  "
14,160485557,Daniel Pearl,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,9 Sep,Are real gun folks ok with the wrong people having guns just because they population control themselves?
15,160485557,Joe Smith,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,10 Sep,The so-called real gun folks are the same ones who stole this nation. So when we speaking  of the wrong people having guns we should look at the culture of guns. Unfortunately the so-called bad people with guns are only killing themselves
16,160485557,Daniel Pearl,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Sep,Right. Or threatening and hurting good people. 
17,160485557,Katy Allen,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Sep,Yeah been happened for ten years at my house. It‚Äôs better than it used to be but seems to have spiked again recentlu
18,160485557,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,11 Sep,"There was something going on along Colfax this afternoon about 3pm. I drove past a couple fire trucks and several police vehicles with a bunch of people standing around. It was on the south side of Colfax and I was heading west so I couldn't really see anything much about what was going on except for all the vehicles with flashing lights. A few blocks further west at a pawn shop, I think, there were a couple more police vehicles and the police were removing yellow tape that had basically blocked off the entire corner of the street where the pawn shop is. I don't know if those things were related or not, but it sure was a lot of police activity in a short stretch along Colfax this afternoon."

0,182398376,Bobby Yocum,‚Ä¢ Central Park,4 Apr,SlingTV is probably the cheapest option and starts at $35 per month and then you can add packages onto it
1,182398376,Gloria McGrath,‚Ä¢ Central Park,5 Apr,"Do you know with sling TV (Is consider blue for $35/month since has a bit more Sports channels). if there are other hidden charges for remotes? If I choose sling TV can that same premium be used on other TVs in the home? If I chose sling TV, does their adapter enhance reception, which cable does now?  Also, Xfinity told me if I cut the cable and just kept the Internet that Internet would cost me $60 per month. Does that seem reasonable?"
2,182398376,Deb Barela,‚Ä¢ Central Park,5 Apr,I will go into the xfinity store ever so often and renegotiate.  They always have a better deal for me.  I thought the same thing about changing but also concerned I‚Äôll end up at the same price by the time I add in what we watch...
3,182398376,Barbara Smith,‚Ä¢ Lowry,5 Apr,"I cut the cable but the problem was finding the lowest internet provider.  Not much choice, either Comcast or Century Link.  After you find the internet provider then there are great apps you can buy.  I found MSNBC only offered by 2 different apps.  First is  Hulu plus about $65/mo or Sling blue 35/mo .  Sling has 2 packages Orange, mostly sports and Blue which has MSNBC.  You can spend about $45/mo for both Orange and Blue on Sling or just buy either separately for about $35/mo."
4,182398376,Gloria McGrath,‚Ä¢ Central Park,5 Apr,"Actually, after I did my Sling homework, it‚Äôs the blue that provides more sports and red zone can be added on for $10 per month. To get both the orange and the blue would cost $50 to bundle."

23,153840390,Lindsay Wa,‚Ä¢ Del Mar North,5 Jul,People spending their stimulus checks ? It‚Äôs just burning up money
24,153840390,Mary M Anderson,‚Ä¢ Lyn Knoll,5 Jul,Use your resources closest to you. Access Aurors had excellent advice on keeping  out animals.calm and not so reactive in out homes or.with us.  Couldn't said so well  myself!!

27,153840390,Matt Minton,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,5 Jul,"One thing we found out:  Fireworks must be legal in Aurora now.  Either that or ""bright light, big boom scare APD"""
28,153840390,Maude Zilla,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,5 Jul,"I understand how frustrating/annoying/etc the summer-long fireworks noise can be and is for fur babies and those with PTSD. However, I feel it needs to be said: First, and foremost, I highly doubt everyone who is shooting off fireworks each time is jumping onto Nextdoor to see what their neighbors have to say. IF you're capable of being calm and kind, I would suggest trying to talk directly to those shooting fireworks off (but only if you're capable of turning off the 'Karen' in you). It may not stop the fireworks completely, but if you approach them RESPECTFULLY, you may see a conscious effort to tone it down by your neighbors. "

3,154627634,Dave D.,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NE,12 Jul,They stopped the in person meetings because people were calling them out for doing things like canceling their meetings and not voting the way their constituents want.

7,154627634,Rolly Carve,‚Ä¢ Highland,13 Jul,"Patrick H. The homeless problem is out of control and we need to bring back state asylums that can care for these people away from downtown.

11,154627634,Hawk C.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,13 Jul,It‚Äôs just what they want....this way they can pass legislation without any face-to-face interaction with their constituents.  Typical of the left leaning city council and the local government.

13,154627634,Gayle G.,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,13 Jul,"Was driving pass Wash Park on Downing last week.  2 homeless men - 1 could barely stand with the help of the bench, the other on the ground trying to get up but couldn't.  If I wouldn't have had a friend's child, I would have stopped to help.  There were several people walking/jogging within a few feet but didn't bother to help.  I wonder if these were some of the same people who felt the need to attempt to shame me for suggesting money be given to homeless shelters rather than dangerous street corners.  Just sayin', lol."
14,154627634,Rolly Carve,‚Ä¢ Highland,13 Jul,You‚Äôre welcomed to advocate for bringing back state asylums with us.  Think of it as a large park surrounded by living/medical facilities that takes care of them outside the city. It starts by getting the city council to demand such change.
15,154627634,Florence Sebern,‚Ä¢ VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,13 Jul,Deliberative Assembly: A deliberative assembly or body -- the kind of gathering to which parliamentary law is generally understood to apply -- has the following distinguishing characteristics.
16,154627634,Adam Estroff,‚Ä¢ Baker,13 Jul,The online meetings I've attended have still been pretty robust for communication and deliberation. Around the country there's actually been an improvement in the diversity of attendance at public meetings because of the virtual changes.
17,154627634,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,13 Jul,"i have always liked how Robert‚Äôs Rules described deliberation, and i definitely have had qualms over the years about decisions deliberated by email; virtual meetings have are much better, though"
18,154627634,Kathleen M.,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,13 Jul,"City Council can‚Äôt handle the people questioning their failed policies. How about canceling the $60,000 per day Convention Ctr contract for COVID beds we never needed or used? It runs through 12/31/2020. Do the math, CO could use that money for food banks or other useful issues. Stop the spending for political reasons. This is not a p***ing contest."

21,154627634,Gayle W.,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,13 Jul,"Maybe I don't understand but doesn't the City own the Convention Center and is actually just moving money around in paying that charge? What can a few lights and maybe a security guard or two cost. Are they calculating in lost revenue for conventions/trade shows? I e-mailed our council member and, of course, got no response. Can anyone shed light on this?"
22,154627634,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,13 Jul,"the city contracts with a private company to operate the Convention Center; under the contract, the city has to pay that company when it uses the facility"
23,154627634,Angie H.,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,14 Jul,"Legislating virtually is absolutely not better or comparable‚Äînor does it encourage transparency, accountability, engagement or deliberation. It is also a woefully inadequate replacement for in-person legislating. Virtual participation (allowing testimony for constituents who cannot be there) should augment to allow for wider participation and more transparency- but it‚Äôs a poor substitute for the whole process and no one should be okay with this ever becoming standard operating procedure (in the case anyone argues for it) Being a legislator is not an at-home work opportunity."

11,148290958,Kristabell Johnson,‚Ä¢ Sable Altura Chambers,51w,"If it bothers you to see people without a home camping then do something about it that helps them. Get them some homes or help the get a job or in some cases help them get mental help or detoxed. Some people work and are homeless. I have known several people over my lifetime that have been homeless and go to work everyday. Just be thankful that it is not you trying to find a place to stay and struggling. Be grateful for the home, vehicle and friends that you have. With the economy as screwed as it is anyone could become homeless at this point.(edited)"
12,148290958,Linda Bailey,‚Ä¢ Norfolk Glenn,16 May,You are right to a point. There are alot of them that don't want help or are beyond help. They chose to drink or do drugs that put them in those situations.  Some probably were given help but went back to there addiction.  They don't want to deal with every day life because of their choices. Homeless people will always be but our government needs to step up and help to provide them a place to camp and provide restrooms and dumpsters. I know it takes money but doesn't it take money to clean up after them. Remember some of these people are VETERANS!!
13,148290958,April Chase,‚Ä¢ Sable Altura Chambers,15 May,"Aren‚Äôt any of us just a pay check (or unemployment check) away from a similar situation? What‚Äôs embarrassing is that as a society, we have allowed our neighbors to live like this. Maybe embarrassing isn‚Äôt the word. It‚Äôs tragic."

20,148290958,Mary M Anderson,‚Ä¢ Lyn Knoll,16 May,Janey this might be b out of your comfort zone so call your council representative for your area. Not sure who? Call AccessAurora! Look it up. Every complaint has to be addressed. There is a reason I love Aurora. I  lived in another part of Aurora for 22 years
21,148290958,Jodi Garza,‚Ä¢ Sable Altura Chambers,15 May,Have you stopped  and asked them what they need ??
22,148290958,Jancy S.,‚Ä¢ Copper Flats,16 May,"My neighbor asked them once and they said they were just looking for a phone they lost. They've never been in my home so the phone isn't in there. I learned at a young age, you don't open your door for strangers. Its just common sense."
23,148290958,Pete Jend,‚Ä¢ Apache Mesa,16 May,The large camps started way before the xx virus.  Denver routinely pushes them out of their city into neighboring areas. Hickenlooper even used buses to move the homeless outside of Denver.
24,148290958,Mary M Anderson,‚Ä¢ Lyn Knoll,16 May,"I remember going on a ride a long with APD in the mid 80s. Around  11 or 12 pm., we made our way round to going into the White Spot. There four homeless were encountered. All 4 were shown the way into Denver. Denver has the shelters. Aurora didn't!!"
25,148290958,Pete Jend,‚Ä¢ Apache Mesa,16 May,"There is a very successful working model in Florida. Privately funded and managed. It provides small shelters, security, job assistance and more. The only reason it won't work here is it takes too much power away from the local governments."
26,148290958,Debbie Brown,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,16 May,My experience with the City of Aurora is that they will do nothing. I was directed to the Homeless Task Force and got a run around.
27,148290958,Pete Jend,‚Ä¢ Apache Mesa,16 May,"Perhaps more complaints would help?  I had a situation with a small group, about 4 people, living under a bicycle/pedestrian bridge.  I complained about the human waste. The city delivered a porta-a-potty. I also complained about the piles of trash they dumped on my property. The city came and picked it up.  I guess the city got tired of cleaning, so they had steel grates/fencing welded around the area to keep people out."
28,148290958,Jessica Meadows,‚Ä¢ Norfolk Glenn,16 May,"Homelessness is a problem but people bickering isn‚Äôt a solution. Councilmember Hiltz claims the city offers many resources for homelessness, it does require more then one person filling out a form for them to do something though. And I wouldn‚Äôt walk in to a homeless camp alone and ‚Äúask them what they need.‚Äù That‚Äôs naive. The city does need more and better solutions and to add more resources before Aurora looks like downtown Denver. :("
29,148290958,Jennifer P.,‚Ä¢ Highline Villages,17 May,"They do offer resources, but never enough. It is so sad. How many women, men, and children are turned away because all the beds for the evening have been taken? Public housing and the section 8 list has a wait list of roughly 2 years. Emergency cases are moved to the front of the line occasionally."
30,148290958,Becky Loescher,‚Ä¢ Highline Villages,16 May,"There are a couple of documentaries which give a good look at homelessness.  ""Poverty, Inc.""  and ""When Helping Hurts"""
31,148290958,Nobalee Nation,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,16 May,My apologies if I have offended anyone. At no point did I insult any person. I merely said that it is disgusting & an embarrassment to our city. ‚úåÔ∏è

Alameda deemed him well enough to travel from there to the shelter yesterday. They said they will be doing a full exam at some point today. She told me that they believe the weight and slender build are most likely due to his advanced age...think at least 8 if not older. He‚Äôs not chipped as well, so not sure if he‚Äôll be picked up. If you know anyone with experience with elder bigger dogs, please have them reach out to the shelter. It‚Äôs never too late to find a loving home for this senior doggie!"

2,133747650,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Jan 20,She didn‚Äôt say the geese poop caused the seizures directly. The seizures were a result of the giardia which was caused by the geese poop. She wasn‚Äôt spreading incorrect or false information. Read carefully.

6,133747650,Melissa Dye,‚Ä¢ Washington Virginia Vale,1y,"The geese LOVE my yard and i do my best to clean up after them, but it's always a challenge. I'm so sorry for your loss."
7,133747650,Loretta Cecelia,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,6 Jan 20,Thank you for posting this. I have a park across the street from me that is filled with these droppings. My vet told me it isn‚Äôt a concern but after reading this I know it is. My dog likes to smell it but I don‚Äôt let him stay stagnate on it long enough to eat it.
8,133747650,Traci Collins,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,7 Jan 20,This is why parks and rec is right to kill enough of them to cut down on the number of geese in public parks. I just wish they would thin out some of the flocks in our neighborhood. Goose poop is the only kind of poop my dog likes and he loves it. Finding walking routes without goose poop is a major challenge.
9,133747650,Sue Phillips,‚Ä¢ Lowry,7 Jan 20,"Yeah, I hear you, but this was their stopping off point for years before Lowry neighborhood existed.  I say no to thinning out the heard.  I just avoid certain areas.  My dogs got better health care then I give myself.  My vet was very clear with me she probably had the seizure from the geese poop.  I took her to Alameda emergency vets that night and they gave her a medication and told me to give her another pill at 0500.  I did and was at Belcaro‚Äôs door 08:00 when they opened.  He asked me to let him have her for the day.  You could tell he was upset about the med I gave her as he felt it was too strong for her.  He wanted to flush it out of her system.  She was drunk.  That afternoon he informed me she had girardia and he then informed me that giradia can cause seizures in dogs.  He asked me to take her home and bring her back the next day.  I did.  (I was off).  Every day that week she went in for a check up, and she died on Friday.  She developed a respiratory infection Friday and he felt it was too much for her.  Up until the seizure she had been great."
10,133747650,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 Jan 20,"Hmmm. Nope. Instead of killing innocent animals, maybe don‚Äôt let your dog eat geese poop? I have lived here for 4 years and the geese have never been a problem for me or my dogs."
11,133747650,Traci Collins,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,7 Jan 20,I wish they would restrict themselves to one area. I live in Windsor Gardens and we have so much grass it is a goose buffet. It seems like areas change on almost a daily basis.

18,133747650,Laura E.,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,9 Jul,The Department of Parks and Recreation is getting ready to round up and slaughter the beautiful Canadian geese in our parks!! 500 are destined to be murdered. This despicable plan is happening right now. The saddest thing is that the geese have just molted so they cannot fly away to evade their captors and their cruel fate. Please write your council people and our Mayor to prevent any more slaughter.

28,133747650,Laura E.,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,10 Jul,"It's an all-out slaughter. Do you know, Matthew Dahlin, how the geese are killed? Maybe if the Department of Parks and Recreation would be transparent about how the geese are murdered, there would be an even greater outcry to spare them. They don't hurt anything in the environment. The most they do is ""hurt"" the spoiled, entitled humans who complain ad nauseaum about goose poop and don't like to be inconvenineced by dodging it in the parks.  ."
29,133747650,Matthew Dahlin,‚Ä¢ Central Park,10 Jul,"They actually do hurt the ecosystem. The lakes are out of balance and hurts the fish population. But please, feel how you like. But just because you say that an unbalanced overpopulation of geese isn‚Äôt harmful, doesn‚Äôt make it true"

Take a hot shower and breathe in the steam.  Use eucalyptus and menthol to open passages.  Then, stand in front of the freezer and breathe cold air.  Vicks on the feet with socks helps.

20,169110599,Marlissa Netzel,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,28 Nov,You have an acute case of bronchontis. Call your provider see if they will give you tesslon perles and robitussin with codeine. You might need an antibiotic. You can do a vitual Tele med appt with them.  You actually got a covid test saying negative? Vaporizer helps a cool mist one with distilled water . you can use vicks. Honey and lemon in hot water is good. But you have this reactive air way cough that is throwing you into asthma.  Do you have a nebulizer machine.  Your provider can help you get one
21,169110599,Ruby Robledo,‚Ä¢ Montbello,28 Nov,Hi yes i actually went to the hospital Denver health she did give me pills to kill the infection for 4 days and was negative for covid . She did do an X-ray I demanded it and she said she had want to do it but she said no I don‚Äôt have bronchitis nor what I though pulmonary she said X-rays look fine but full of infection and we‚Äôre swollen she also make me take a steroid for inflammation and she did give me a instrument with a different inhaler because that night I could breath so now I just have a cough üò∑

28,169110599,Ella Hawk,‚Ä¢ Parkfield,28 Nov,You could try avoiding dairy to lesson the phlegm production. My brother-in-law swears by a shot of whisky to cure a sore throat lol
29,169110599,Angel Acosta,‚Ä¢ Montbello,28 Nov,Agreed. Dairy and any cold liquids tend to create extra phlegm - stay away from both till this has passed. Stick to room temperature or hot liquids in the mean time. Hope you get better soon!
30,169110599,Janet McKinley,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,28 Nov,"I've been coughing since June 2019. They have done so many tests and I'm ""normal "". I do have asthma and the cough started with an exacerbation of asthma. My pulmonologist and ENT both gave me this advice- it doesn't fix it,  but minimizes the severity.  Avoid all menthol products- only cough drop without menthol that is also sugar free is Halls Breeze. Your pharmacy can order these for you. "
31,169110599,Ruby Robledo,‚Ä¢ Montbello,28 Nov,Yes I got them it has helped a bit and then menthol ricola have helped more then halls for me
32,169110599,Janet McKinley,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,23w,Menthol does contribute as an irritant so if it helps you that is good.  Just keep in mind it may contribute to the irritation causing the cough.  I really hope you get better more quickly than me.(edited)

2,152769055,Danielle Shepard,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Jun,"We watched an obvious drug deal in front of our house that went on for ~25 minutes. Called right away and police never showed. This was a few weeks ago and would've been an easy arrest. I complained to our councilwoman and was put in touch with a direct police contact. Her advice was to put together a neighborhood watch for our block, and to call in, no matter how small the problem. If you have neighbors that can also see this person, ask them to call in too. DM me if you'd like the contact info I have. I know not particularly helpful in the moment, but that's what I heard from our reps."
3,152769055,Dan Braden,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,26 Jun,"Call the police and informing them of the problem, then when you get pushback about it being low priority, say ""OK thanks, well I'll go out and shoot them"" then hang up.  And when they show up in a minute or so, show them your camera you were going to shoot them with."

9,152769055,Kacey Mathews,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Jun,"The problem is what‚Äôs going in this country regarding the police. What I have heard on the news in other cities, the police aren‚Äôt showing up for certain calls that they are getting.

22,152769055,Julia Gunter,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Jun,"NVM, as soon as I made that last post the police called showed up. I told them I didn't want to get him in trouble or press trespassing charges, and they told me he would be taken somewhere to sleep."

7,185779423,Melody Obuobisa,‚Ä¢ Montbello,3 days ago,After 10 days in Colorado they can put her up for adoption.  But they have to post her online and look for the family first.  If nothing was posted or available online at the shelter... especially during covid... thats not fare. I work at a clinic and we just reunited a dog after 1 month or more. Make them show you proof of posting the 10 day hold.

Anything that a legitimate RTD patron puts in the can in my front yard I will happily take care of, because that means it is not dumped in my yard.

All depends on your plumbing I guess.  Or if you are willing to split a larger dog's poo into a 2 separate flushes.

0,172740206,Verna Salone,‚Ä¢ Lowry,5 Jan,"I would recommend you bomb the apartment a few times, thoroughly wash and clean EVERYTHING you own before and after moving, and then bomb your new apartment as well just to make sure you don‚Äôt bring any with you. Even if you do end up bringing one or two, the bombing and cleaning in the new apartment should kill them. Be sure you clean your new apartment top to bottom before moving in as well and inspect it just to ensure you don‚Äôt find any other bugs. Sometimes when you live in an apartment building, if someone else in the building has roaches and they manage to get into your place, you won‚Äôt be able to get rid of them until the other person (or people) has gotten rid of them. Make sure you buy one of those covers that go under your door, I forget what they‚Äôre called but they‚Äôre usually to stop the draft from coming in the house. They can stop bugs from coming in as well."
1,172740206,Cortney Worrell,‚Ä¢ Lowry,5 Jan,I would also put belongings in a truck overnight and bomb before moving into new apt.
2,172740206,Jennifer Dillon,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Jan,"Throw away all cardboard.

9,172740206,Sara B.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Jan,"Thanks, I‚Äôm willing to try anything!!!"
10,172740206,Amber Webb,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,7 Jan,"Sara Bandoni use this in your new apartment, not the old one because the infestation is moving based on tenants moving out. They go to the food sources, so I'd spend the last couple weeks at the old place not cooking and just wrapping everything in plastic. If you can afford a storage unit for a month,  that's what we did. We washed all fabrics at a laundry mat and then stored everything for a month.  We treated our new house and then put everything in the garage as we moved it in so we could check every box(I get that you might not have a garage so do it one box at a time from storage if you can). I'd also do boric acid in the new apartment too to help guarantee they die if any do transfer over. I found the most bodies in the box with my ps3."
11,172740206,Beverly Muncy Cahill,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,5 Jan,Diatomaceous earth. It's a powdery substance you can get at Home Depot. Sprinkle it everywhere. Make sure to get food grade. It's safe for humans and pets. It cuts the exoskeleton of the pests and they dry out and die. Trust me. Look it up on Amazon and read the reviews. I had a horrible bed bug infestation. Worst time of my life. Diatomaceous earth got rid of them almost immediately. I am pest free. I always keep a rim of the powder along my floorboards.
12,172740206,Sara B.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Jan,"I struggle with this simply because I‚Äôve heard with treatments that exterminators do, will make the diatomaceous earth solidify. Apparently you cannot do both"
13,172740206,Gloria BURNS,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Jan,"hi i had he same problem if i got rid of them in about a week.get boric acid walmart should have it,its not harmful i put it in my kitchen every where what i remember i mix it with sugar. also you can google it i promise you if you put it down you will be free of them in a week.please let me know.my son at the time was sensitive to pest decide so i had to use natural product.have a good evening let me know."
14,172740206,Gloria BURNS,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Jan,If you want to be free of roaches just use boric acid you can google it trust me it work and safe. please let me know you can get them gone in about a week
15,172740206,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 Jan,"I used borax powder in Texas and it kept them out, and Texas has some epic roaches"

If they want their rent! But Borac Acid works really well. But toasters small electronics i would get rid of. They are hard to get rid of eggs. O would bomb every little knook their was. Then send renter management all the receipts, cost it would be replacing my items. TVs, any electronics etc. They will pay me to but new ones...."
17,172740206,Nadine Rains,‚Ä¢ Aurora,6 Jan,Management don‚Äôt care and Colorado doesn‚Äôt count it as a reason to not pay rent! I tried!
18,172740206,Theresa Venters,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Jan,I put the traps and followed instructions. They eat that bait & take it back & it kills off the colony. Because I think they eat their dead ones. Anywho it worked I killed any I saw too on the spot.
19,172740206,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 Jan,"Having lived in Texas where everybody has them, I can tell you that unless they get completely eliminated from your entire building, if your neighbors have them, you will have them too. "
20,172740206,Nadine Rains,‚Ä¢ Aurora,6 Jan,"That‚Äôs what happened to me when I first moved here!!! I‚Äôve never come in contact with those nasty things, and we had moved into one that was just crawling with them! We had to toss our couches, and all our ‚Äúcrevice‚Äù items like our step stools, fold up anything. We use bug barrier on EVERY EDGE AND CORNER. everything sits like an inch out and we spray every week. We also do a monthly bombing, and we use auntie fays roach spray. That stuff is HEAVEN!! Kills on contact AND is natural! When we spoke to the apartment complex, I was shaking from how disgusted I was, and they looked at me so blankly and said roaches are pretty much everywhere in urban Colorado, and if I ‚ÄúREALLY was worried you‚Äôd find a clean house‚Äù.... lol useless"
21,172740206,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 Jan,"OMG roaches are NOT everywhere in urban Colorado. It's cold here in the winter and that will kill them. They ARE everywhere in the south, but not here. Lazy, careless uncaring management!"
22,172740206,Sharon Duwaik,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,17w,You can contact Code Enforcement and or the Tri-County Health Department.  Boric Acid or diatomaceous earth works also.  ACE Hardware at 6th & Peoria is wonderful to ask for advice.(edited)
23,172740206,Sara B.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Jan,"I tried the health dept. with ‚Äúeverything else going on‚Äù (IT that shall not be named; you cannot say the C word in post, apparently) i don‚Äôt think my problem is a priority."
24,172740206,Omar Cisneros,‚Ä¢ Central Park,6 Jan,Try not to put too much chemical down. The longer you do that the more immune they will get to the chemicals. I think there are laws protecting you from this issue if you moved in with them already there. I worked doing pest control inspections before and if your neighbors don‚Äôt make as much as an effort as you they will not go away completely. I would highly recommend Cesar with Pest Protector he does a very professional and thorough job. (720) 620-3489
25,172740206,Beverly Muncy Cahill,‚Ä¢ Del Mar Parkway,6 Jan,That's why I like diatomaceous earth.  It's not a chemical.
26,172740206,Sara B.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Jan,"I did move in with them.... one of the employees who worked here then said everyone had a problem and moved because of it. I tried so hard to get out of my lease, contacted health dept, Colorado apartment association, wrote certified letters to management. "
27,172740206,Angel Acosta,‚Ä¢ Montbello,6 Jan,Many good tips listed above...We too lived in TX long ago.  To keep them at bay our mom sprinkled a mix of powdered sugar and baking soda along the outside of the house and the fence.  I know it sounds weird but it worked.  You'd think ants would be attracted to it but they weren't for some reason. Dead roaches everywhere - it worked and it saved our pets from the chemical!
28,172740206,Rebecca Mayer,‚Ä¢ Lowry,6 Jan,I bought appliances a few years back that arrived with Roaches in them took a bit for me to figure out what they were as they started as small as a tip of a pencil. (Disgusting it was). I hired Orkin and after 2 sprays they were gone.
29,172740206,Sara B.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Jan,I have a inspection with them sat! Cannot be sooner.
30,172740206,Emily Sevier,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,6 Jan,"I'm from Houston, and with the rain, heat and humidity, roaches are very common. Boric Acid is a common cure. It's cheap, pets won't eat it, and it has gotten rid of horrible infestations when I've moved in to new places."
31,172740206,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 Jan,"Anyone from Houston definitely knows roaches! I agree, boric acid/borax worked real well for me."
32,172740206,JEREMIAH J.,‚Ä¢ Aurora Hills,6 Jan,HMU... I'm an exterminator
33,172740206,Julianne Martel,‚Ä¢ Highland Park East,7 Jan,"fwiw - when we moved from our last apartmentwe had issues with roaches and Orkin had to come out and I multiple treatments. Apparently the roaches in CO are called German Roaches and much harder to get rid of than the ones from the South. We had tried diatomaceous earth and it didn't have much of an effect. We didn't try the dogs or bug bombs because we have pets, it was better to bring in the pros. "
34,172740206,Kayla Banks,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,7 Jan,I'll be honest with you everybody gave great advice but I'mma tell you step-by-step what you need to do we can take all your clothes at one time bag them up wash everything in your kitchen you take everything out of the cabinets wipe every cabinet every door every countertop with only bleach you clean the rest of your baseboards and your floor will bleach if you can if you cannot then go and get LA's awesome cleaner is in a yellow is yellow you can get it from Dollar Tree and use that to clean the floorboards because it won't stay in your carpet basically you need to bleach the entire house after you bleach the entire house and move everything flip over every couch open up every cabinet Kevin things that need to be covered in the directions for a bomb when you bomb put two bombs in the kitchen and one bomb everywhere else the longer that you let the bomb sit the more that it works when you come home you'll see a whole bunch of them dead man wherever get the bleach out again Andre clean and wipe down everything with only bleach after you've cleaned up you put Roach sticky pads and hotels in the corners up under the cabinets do not keep any plastic bags like from King Soopers they love them any area of your sink that is leaking water they love that make sure that gets fixed if you have any water leakage anywhere that is why they're staying the next thing you need to do is make sure you have at least three bottles of boric acid and you line the entire house in the kitchen put it behind the stove and microwave everything for the bottom drawer out of your stove and leave it out until you see that they are gone do not leave any food out do not leave any food in the sink do not leave crumbs on the table because otherwise you will continue to see them also from Home Depot you need to get a home barrier spray and you spray the whole outside of your house if you can like if you stay in an apartment spray all around your front door all of those walls that connect to somebody else's what the barrier spray and then come in the house and do every barrier floorboard up under the sinks doorways everything that connects to somebody else's house and then you should be on your way to not seeing any roaches the key thing though is bleach and keeping up all the crumbs leaving no food in the sink making sure you don't have any leaks and you should be good if you need any help text me and let me know have a good day

5,154469263,Toni Vaeth,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Jul,Actions speak louder than protests and words
6,154469263,shannon quillian,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Jul,Thank you for reminding all of us to be watchful and to see the needs for our fellow man. It is sad  that we can be sooooo wrapped up in me myself and I that we don‚Äôt See
7,154469263,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Jul,I had a motorcycle accident at Quebec and 23rd where my clutch stuck and when it engaged the rear tire spun out leaving me on the ground. At least 2 people got out of their vehicles to help me. Just depends on the people and a lot are just too self absorbed
8,154469263,Earl Purdy,‚Ä¢ Hale,10 Jul,Thank you for stepping up and helping.

11,154469263,Rick and Cathy Reynolds,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Jul,"On the other hand I was  at Colfax & Quebec with a dead battery one day last Fall.  I had barely opened the back of my SUV and pulled out my jumper cables.  The very first car that drove by stopped and asked if I needed a jump.  ""Yes, thank you.""  They parked beside me, and jumped my car and were gone before I could thank them.  (Young couple with two kids heading north into Park Hill.)"
12,154469263,Toni Vaeth,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Jul,I think Phillip is talking to the current landscape- a sign in front of your house is easier than stopping to help 
13,154469263,Pauline Edwards,‚Ä¢ Skyland,10 Jul,How time has changed
14,154469263,Cindy Dickey,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,43w,I witnessed a woman unable to get her car started at 23rd an dexter. Cars honked and no one moved to help. I tried to help her leaving my 5yr old on the sidewalk. A man ran out from the coffee shop and got it into gear. But man was I disappointed in our neighborhood.(edited)
15,154469263,Toni Vaeth,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Jul,Yard signs and protests are easier than actions in our daily lives that are not visible to those around us.
16,154469263,Timothy Chandler,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,11 Jul,Why do you keep mentioning the signs you said it more than once I think the signs bother you oh well
17,154469263,Nora Weiker,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,43w,I was leaving my Drs. office after having hip surgery. I was in the elevator and became weak and dizzy and finally collapsed. The doors opened and the passengers stepped over me to get out but.. no one even asked if I needed help. I'd say we still have a way to go! That behavior would never cross my mind.(edited)
18,154469263,shannon quillian,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Jul,Yes indeed
19,154469263,Phillip Astein,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,10 Jul,Whoa. That‚Äôs crazy Nora. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you.
20,154469263,Ben Gilliam,‚Ä¢ Central Park,10 Jul,Thank you for being a part of our neighborhood and for the reminder that common decency to someone in need is far more important than slapping up a sign and feeling like by doing that you did your part. We all must watch out and take care of each other . Truly appreciate your stepping up!
21,154469263,Shari Wilkins-Duley,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,10 Jul,This says something about your character.  Well done!  Good to know someone like you is out there in the world!
22,154469263,Nora Weiker,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,10 Jul,One positive note that makes me smile whenever I think of it. I was sitting in my car talking with a neighborhood homeless man I had spoken with him often. A young man saw us and stood and watched making sure I was safe. That's class! N

15,165608646,Dani Nash,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,28 Oct,"These two non-profits provide resources for folks once they‚Äôve been released, but they may be able to help answer your question and hopefully help in the future."
16,165608646,Randall Montano,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,28 Oct,"Kelly comco I am sure they offer the help for mental illness in the institution he is being housed. My aunt works helping disabled vets who are homeless but finds it impossible to help most of them because they continue to show up at the facility either drunk or high on illegal drugs and they refuse to enter a rehab facility! They then piss and moan saying nobody will help them! In order to receive the help they must stop drinking alcohol and doing illegal drugs but will not,so don't give me another sad story of how these people are victims of the system because they're not! In order for them to receive help they must first want to help themselves. My son is  addicted to methane when he received his $1,200 guess where the first place he went was! Lets just say,he didn't spend the money on new clothes,toiletries or any other essentials he spent it all smoking meth! When said ""guy"" this man is trying to help gets released to do you think the first thing  this ""guy"" will do is enter a rehab or seek help for his mental health?"
17,165608646,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,28 Oct,Mental illness and drug addiction can be very separate issues.  Leo is trying to help a young man not listen to you and your third hand rants about your aunts experiences.  Stay on topic.

20,165608646,Jeff Harbaugh,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27w,I agree. Pam and Christie do a great job. Do remember them on Giving Tuesday. They have not been able to host fundraising events as many nonprofits have been in the same situation due to the pandemic.(edited)

3,160977525,Kristabell Johnson,‚Ä¢ Sable Altura Chambers,33w,Kimberly Pearce I don‚Äôt know I think asthma is more annoying. Sometimes it slows me down or makes me take a break when I want to get things done. Don‚Äôt get me wrong if is gets very bad and I don‚Äôt have an inhaler then it can be a little scary but that is rare. Worse case I buy Primatene Mist and use that inhaler‚Äîeven though those inhalers feel like they burn my lungs they work.(edited)

Several times she has been short of materials and has had a few road blocks, but always seems to find a way to make things work and makes sure she get you a mask.  My mom and best friend have also made masks for our families and it is a lot of work.  This lady is making these day in and day out for complete strangers and gifting to anyone in need.

That affects the demand worldwide therefore affects the US and demand in the US therefore that is why there are layoffs and business struggling (including ours) and closing or declaring bankruptcy.  The price of crude is the lowest ever.  When the price of crude drops this low, oil and gas businesses are hard pressed to sustain themselves.  So all these items contribute to the layoffs."

And a homeless woman actually gave my nice bike back to a neighbor - the thieves must have given it to her being a woman's bike and she didn't want it."

1,162759105,Michael Warren,‚Ä¢ Lowry,28 Sep,It doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone was shot. It happened right outside my place and I saw them speed off. I was wondering if they fired the shots in the air. I looked everywhere to see where a bullet might have struck. It was either aimed at another car or person I never saw or maybe into the air. I‚Äôll keep posting if I hear more info. I helped the cops find the shells.

3,162759105,Ernesto PR,‚Ä¢ Lowry,28 Sep,"With an average home price of over $700k, I doubt this is a neighborhood that a street gang can afford, or most anyone else for that matter. As a Lowry resident for the past 10yrs, no, not a single street gang originates from Lowry. There is petty theft and common crime just like anywhere else in Denver."
4,162759105,Telmahury Robledo,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,28 Sep,How scary!
5,162759105,Michael Warren,‚Ä¢ Lowry,28 Sep,They hit the bike rack and the kids bike trying to exit and drive over the sidewalk and lawn. There is no outlet behind our townhomes.
6,162759105,Andrea Sanders,‚Ä¢ Lowry,28 Sep,Penelope saw the bikes this morning and was so sad hers and Hosea‚Äôs bikes are ruined!
7,162759105,Laurie Jensen,‚Ä¢ East Washington Virginia Vale,28 Sep,"That‚Äôs really sad. If glad no one was hurt. I do think that it‚Äôs a little closed minded to think that gangs aren‚Äôt in lowry because the cost of living is too high. Gangs are funded by drugs and they are collectively responsible for billions of dollars in drug transactions in this country annually.  I‚Äôm sure gangs would be glad to deal out of Lowry for the same reason that the residents of Lowry love it. What keeps gangs out of neighborhoods is a close knit community and people that keep an eye out for crime. I think Lowry is like a lot of neighborhoods in Denver, people don‚Äôt talk and aren‚Äôt aware of what‚Äôs happening in the neighborhood."

21,162759105,Anne Eisen,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,28 Sep,I also doubt police will be defunded. They need reform however or they will defund themselves from all the lawsuits. $20 million paid out from 2004 thru 2019. It‚Äôs just hard to get the bad apples out.
22,162759105,Jan H.,‚Ä¢ Lowry,28 Sep,Its a bad orchard
23,162759105,cylie babcock,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,28 Sep,"Also, defunding doesn‚Äôt mean eliminating, but rather funding services for correct response and intervention. A good model is already around, look at suburban neighborhoods, that is what it means. Obviously no one wants the police to just disappear, but training and support are key to a more equitable version of policing in America."
24,162759105,Norma Clark,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,28 Sep,"Just coincidental, but has anybody thought that people are trying to drive home prices down"
25,162759105,Paul Vranas,‚Ä¢ Lowry,28 Sep,I heard it was Qanon

27,162759105,Anne Eisen,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,28 Sep,This is so sad to hear. That park has been my salvation during covid and recuperating after a ladder gave out under me.  I relearned to walk there.  It is so peaceful and beautiful. Everyone there always seems happy to be there.  To think people were shot there is so disturbing.  I imagine to the people shot also.

1,148006000,Paul Ryan,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 May,I‚Äôm still learning from South Park hill. One more is Westerly Creek trail through Stapleton which will take you out to Sand Creek trail which you can ride across to connect with Platte River trail and go wherever from there.
2,148006000,Ann Mathews,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,13 May,A bike path map has been published. I think I got mine at a bike shop or REI.

5,148006000,Katie Moriarty,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 May,Same!!!! I been riding over to Northfield too over 1-70 but traffic over there is kinda scary. You‚Äôll have to let me know if you think of anything. I‚Äôm trying to figure out different loops. üòÇ
6,148006000,Todd Chalmers,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 May,"For an urban ride, I like to cut through City Park, then Cheesman and head on to Wash Park. If you follow the bike route streets there‚Äôs not much traffic."
7,148006000,Nick Holstein,‚Ä¢ Hale,13 May,"A good resource is Strava's global heatmap.  It doesn't give you any info on the routes, other than their relative popularity with other cyclists/runners/etc.  But you can filter by activity..."

9,148006000,Lou Veritable,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,51w,The Denver Bike Map is a good way to plot a route to the regional trails: https://www.denvergov.org/content/dam/denvergov/Portals/708/documents/2017-Denver-Bike-Map.pdf
10,148006000,Barbara and Steve Krause,‚Ä¢ Hale,14 May,"From Hale I ride South zig-zag to Forest southbound to cross Alameda at a wide intersection and then Leetsdale at a light to get to Cherry Creek Trail (CCT) right at 4 Mile Park. Then you can turn East and go to Cherry Creek Park and beyond, or turn off of CCT to NE or SW on HighLine Canal Trail. Or turn West on CCT and head for downtown and the Platte River Trail"
11,148006000,Doug Schuler,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,15 May,"Cycleton sells a map Bicycling the Greater Metro Area. It is up to date has all of the trails, bike lanes, bike routes from Brookfield to Highland Ranch"
12,148006000,Doug Schuler,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,15 May,"Becky find your way to Sand Creek and Dahlia. Actual Dahlia is a good route. It‚Äôs closed to vehicle traffic but bikes can get through. Take Dahlia north to the traffic light at Sand Creek. At the light right turn across bridge, right turn immediate right turn to bike path.  Take a right on the bike path and your on your way to the Platte bike path. When you get to the path right goes down town left goes to Golden or Brighton. Have fun"
13,148006000,Lou Veritable,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,19 May,"So, Dahlia is open for cyclist from Smith Road to 48th (under I70)?"
14,148006000,Erik Peterson,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,15 May,"Straight down 12th past cheeseman and you hit cherry creek trail, then go up past rei to 14th (I think) which curves into 29th.  Nice little ride!"
15,148006000,Erik Peterson,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,15 May,Sand creek is good too but a little sketchy in parts

17,148006000,Karen White,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,16 May,"1)  Start in highlands anywhere and take 32nd to Golden.  If you still have a lot of ride in you, you can continue up all or part of Look Out Mountain.  "
18,148006000,Jacqueline Altreuter,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,16 May,Use Bike Streets Denver‚Äôs map. They lay out the best routes which are not necessarily the routes that bunch everyone together onto the same ‚Äòdesignated‚Äô path. Much more pleasant. https://www.bikestreets.com/get-the-map
19,148006000,Nick Fuller,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,50w,"Not 13th or 14th. They don't have bike paths.  There are roads right next to them that do, yet these cyclist choose to ride in the middle of the road.  Causing dangerous situations.  Honest whats the point of spending millions in taxes on bike lanes, when they ride in the middle of the road anyways.(edited)"

2,145029783,Bert L.,‚Ä¢ Fort Logan,17 Apr 20,Denver's been a great city since the turn of the century.  Not because of what it's become.
3,145029783,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,20 Apr 20,"Denver still is a great beautiful city, what do u think it has become?"
4,145029783,Donna Subin,‚Ä¢ Windsor East,17 Apr 20,Thank you Mayor Hancock for making that initial decision to put in place the stay at home order before our governor thought it was necessary. You know what needs to be done and I thank you for what you do
5,145029783,Peter M.,‚Ä¢ Baker,17 Apr 20,"I agree.  It is good to remember that the Governor is responsible for the entire state, which is very diverse.  There is also no doubt that he was well aware of Mayor Hancock's plans, for what is by far the largest most populated part of CO.  These things are a significant decision making factor in politics, not just the emotion, but the details of the region, with the known facts, and those yet to be disclosed."

10,145029783,Eileen N.,‚Ä¢ Belcaro,17 Apr 20,I would say:  Don't point any cameras at the crowd.  Don't feed that.
11,145029783,Jeri M.,‚Ä¢ South Mar Lee/Brentwood,17 Apr 20,I believe that the people who don't observe the stay at home order should think about this:!
12,145029783,Israel B.,‚Ä¢ City Park West,17 Apr 20,I understand. I just think fear is more destructive than this virus.
13,145029783,Laura Gee,‚Ä¢ Tava Waters,17 Apr 20,"Although I expected on my own to keep distancing through the end of the month, I don't appreciate the mayor thinking he knows better than the governor and saying he would determine dates on his own. I haven't trusted for a long time that Hancock does what is best for the citizens, only what will put more money in his or the city's coffers."
14,145029783,"Mayor's Office, Director of Strategic Communications Theresa Marchetta",‚Ä¢ City of Denver,17 Apr 20,"Thanks for sharing your opinion, Laura. I'm not sure that it is based in fact, though. I don't think anyone is under the illusion that requiring businesses to close or people to stay at home puts money in anyone's ""coffers"", to say nothing of the tax base we rely on to fund important city services. The Mayor makes decisions based on science and health data- in coordination with the Governor, who by the way, understands that Denver is a densely populated city- where cases/contact/transmission are a greater risk. The Mayor and Governor Polis talk regularly- and the Governor has confidence Mayor Hancock will do what's best for the city he's responsible for protecting. The Governor must make broader decisions for the entire state. We are always coordinating and communicating, and fortunately for all of us, it has worked to our advantage as a state responding with our very best efforts during this unprecedented pandemic."
15,145029783,Bridget A.,‚Ä¢ Hampden,17 Apr 20,"Thank you to Denver Mayor Hancock, Gov. Polis, and Superintendent of Schools Cordova for being proactive to fight Covid-19; your leadership and expertise is extraordinary. So glad to be a resident of this city at this time."

18,145029783,Carole Gentry,‚Ä¢ Sloans/Highlands,17 Apr 20,"Folks in West Highland, our area is a second-tier area in the percentage of COVID19 cases. So many people in this neighborhood still DO NOT wear masks when out and/or observe social distancing."
19,145029783,Porche Lovely,‚Ä¢ Highland,17 Apr 20,I guess that's not a big surprise given that the Highlands is a more densely populated area.  Where did you find that data? (I'm curious about other areas.)  Thanks!
20,145029783,Chris L.,‚Ä¢ Barnum West,1y,Appreciate the updates and I am sincerely hoping we all continue to be patient and do the right thing! It helps if people put it into perspective and consider the alternative which is horrible.(edited)
21,145029783,Gaar Potter,‚Ä¢ Happy Canyon,17 Apr 20,What alternative is horrible? I think shutting down the economy and 20 million unemployed is darned horrible!
22,145029783,David Petersen,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,17 Apr 20,"I don't see why we can't extend it till late May for example. Denver along with other cities don't have enough testing kits and other resources to handle the continued cases. I see it actually getting worse once people go about socializing and not wearing masks. Only about 10% of people in my neighborhood wear masks and most are senior citizens...it's baffling.  A lot of people are not taking this seriously enough until it actually affects them or their family/friends. Too many people (perhaps 10% or more of the population) are walking around asymptomatic, infecting people around them."
23,145029783,Sara J.,‚Ä¢ Harvey Park,17 Apr 20,How do you expect people to survive this long? What about the single mothers who are now facing eviction because they cannot pay rent? There has to be some give at some point. People are losing everything.
24,145029783,Dick Nickoloff,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park South,17 Apr 20,"For once I can agree with Mayor Hancock and Gov. Poliis's way of handling this Quarantine. The issue in Michigan is the strict lockdown covered the entire state when the big issue is SE Michigan and primarily Detroit, (Which by the way wasn't the site of the protest, but it was in Lansing!) Denver unfortunately is very vulnerable thus tighter controls. We are lucky to live mostly in SE Denver, but other parts of this city have some serious issues."
25,145029783,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,1y,Thanks for bringing it into perspective. From The Big MI and know how unbalanced the oversight is.(edited)
26,145029783,Mary M.,‚Ä¢ Fort Logan,17 Apr 20,For people who think that think that the ban is unreasonable I ask why ? What are you hoping to gain . Is it your right to do what you want to do at cost and safety of others ?  I can‚Äôt help think that putting your self and others at risk is worth it . Even if the city opens businesses  what is the benefit if that means we have to start social distancing all over again  .
27,145029783,Sara J.,‚Ä¢ Harvey Park,17 Apr 20,"I believe people are growing increasingly concerned with the fact that losing their homes is becoming a very real possibility. Many people in our city live paycheck to paycheck and not being able to work is having devastating consequences for them. It's not about wanting to ""show the government"". It's about fear of being able to provide for their families."
28,145029783,Mary M.,‚Ä¢ Fort Logan,17 Apr 20,Sara I understand what your saying I to am barely hanging on but I‚Äôd rather stick out a little bit longer than to get sick and have no way to recover because I‚Äôm sick and can‚Äôt get back to work .  To me losing everything is losing a family member .

34,145029783,Jackie F.,‚Ä¢ West Colfax,17 Apr 20,When will testing be made available?? Stop saying young people aren‚Äôt worth a test when I have one friend age 30 who died and a second who was in the ICU age 32 for an entire month and was just released yesterday. Neither had preexisting health issues. Yet several of my demographic have shown symptoms and have been denied testing. How can we go on with our daily lives without knowing if we had it or not?? I speaking of current tests while showing symptoms and antibody testing. If airlines can test passengers and get results within 15 minutes so can we. GET TESTS SO WE CAN REOPEN OUR ECONOMY AND ISOLATE INFECTED PERSONS AND AREAS. Why is the government incapable of doing anything. Just get it done! People are suffering medically and financially.
35,145029783,Cindy H.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,17 Apr 20,"I'm so sorry for your loss :(.  Make sure your friend gets tested again later.  They are finding some test negative after treatment, and then later with repeat testing, they show they're positive again."
36,145029783,"Elizabeth ""Alissa"" Brisson",‚Ä¢ Hampden South,17 Apr 20,You should be able to order extra carts. We have two recycling carts as we generate much more if that than trash and I believe we just called 311 and they got it out to us. We‚Äôve also always told our neighbors that they are more than welcome to throw stuff in our bins once we put them out if they have overflow.

5,145944000,Karen M.,‚Ä¢ Bear Valley East,25 Apr 20,"A major part of the reason for the delay is the inadequate supply of tests which haven't been supplied by the federal government.

Opening up golf courses was clearly a bigger priority then putting a plan in place for the public sheep that we've become. By the way, read the announcement again. If you look at the list of reasons why we're being forced to remain home by Hancock, things like getting testing equipment are lower than others. Very telling!(edited)"

0,159428812,Paul Brown,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Aug,No one should ever read the Glendale Cherry Creek Chronicle. Its garbage and not worth the paper it's paper it's printed on. If I wanted to listen to the ramblings of a bunch of old white Trump supporters I'd move to Nebraska.
1,159428812,Victoria Inman,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Aug,It's total trash. Although I do peruse for a good laugh or five.
2,159428812,Paul Brown,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,36w,Here's a quote from the publisher on his radio show:
3,159428812,John Bachman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Aug,Looks like Glendale Chronicle is being cancelled.
4,159428812,Paul Brown,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Aug,"Yes, I'm under the crazy notion that a person who advocates for school shootings should not be given a platform."
5,159428812,Bridget Walsh,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Aug,"The CCC is a real mixed bag. They have published many articles ghost written by known progressive journalists and community members. They back some of Denver progressive Candi CdeBaca's proposals or at least give them air time and giver credit for representing the interests of her constiuents and not the Hancock gang . And more. On the other hand, they have also aired the views of the far right and featured , for  example, articles by Denise Riech, the Real estate agent who was recently seen taking Black Lives Matters signs off of yards. I read it because I always want to know what the other side is thinking and doing and I appreciate their effort to bring otherwise ignored community opinions to the fore."
6,159428812,John Sawyer,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Aug,Yeah who would want to read an article with actual facts and source citations supporting a trend that just happens to run counter to the prevailing narrative.
7,159428812,Paul Brown,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Aug,Let's turn that around...who would care to read ANYTHING in a newspaper whose publisher hoped for a school shooting to distract from Trump's impeachment?
8,159428812,John Bachman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,36w,"Paul, it looks like you've also cancelled people from the state of Nebraska? Their opinions also not valid?(edited)"
9,159428812,Dana Arvin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Aug,"This site has the specific purpose of addressing group living.  I thought we were going to be adults and keep our politics to ourselves. Cuz guess what, no one really cares about anyones politics, we all understand both sides already."
10,159428812,Doug Bohm,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Aug,What about the ones that support the group living proposals? See what you did there?
11,159428812,Judy Werner,‚Ä¢ Hale,27 Aug,"You are so right on, Paul.  Amanda Sawyer, the city Council person that we the people elected into office is there to serve the developers and she knows what she is doing.  The voters did not ask for rezoning, the developers did and Amanda is there to serve them.  I hope we get to vote on the rezoning as our City Council Rep is not doing what is in our best interest."
12,159428812,Joyce Cerretti,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Aug,"Actually, members like CdeBaca want to cancel suburbia like other big cities by integrating group housing."
13,159428812,Jessie Hardy,‚Ä¢ Hale,27 Aug,I hate that magazine. It‚Äôs horribly pejorative and skewed
14,159428812,Joyce Cerretti,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,27 Aug,"Roger, guess everyone's a racist that disagrees."
15,159428812,Jessie Hardy,‚Ä¢ Hale,27 Aug,That‚Äôs a logical fallacy what you did there.
16,159428812,Joyce Cerretti,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,28 Aug,Jessie Hardy my point exactly.
17,159428812,Judy Werner,‚Ä¢ Hale,28 Aug,No rezoning for Sawyer and CdBaca.
18,159428812,Dana Arvin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,28 Aug,"I think this is a web of issues.  A year ago, CC denied the renewal of contracts for the halfway houses/treatment facilities in the community corrections space.  Ms. C'deBaca said the companies were not acceptable because their parent companies contract with the federal government at the boarder.  You all know the narrative on the boarder issue. From what I can see, the issues are not resolved and CC is looking for alternatives.  This failure to renew those contracts and failure to come up with alternatives, so far, with multiply the homeless population as well as add to the narrative that there isn't enough inexpensive housing.  These are issues that CC has created to open the door to begin the march, with the YIMBYs to make Denver like Portland.  This Group Living issue is just the first of many attempts to destroy our City."
19,159428812,Stephen Eppler,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,36w,There are other problems.
20,159428812,Kim Erickson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,28 Aug,Don‚Äôt like the racist paper or the racist idea limiting access to affordable homes
21,159428812,Gail Schultz,‚Ä¢ Central Park,29 Aug,A decrease of 30/month is not a burst.
22,159428812,Alex Neth,‚Ä¢ Skyland,1 Sep,"While I do enjoy crackin' open the old Nextdoor to read a bunch of people mindlessly repeating the word ""canceled,"" like it means anything in this context besides pro-Trump signaling, the fact of that paper's worthlessness is well established. "
23,159428812,Janet Meredith,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,5 Sep,There were serious issues with the for-profit halfway houses and community corrections facilities. The solutions are not easy but are important. This is about people‚Äôs lives. So is the issue of homelessness- which is complex and getting mush worse with recent job losses. Ms C de Baca is impressive- she is looking for better solutions and she respects the people she serves.
24,159428812,Stephen Eppler,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,35w,The Denver Planning Board passed the Group Living Amendment 9-0 moving it forward in the political process..

We had this happen to us several years ago and our bike (which was worth more than the 2 left in our alley in its place) was taken straight to a pawn shop (our neighbor tracked it down!) Fingers crossed for you.

0,151698104,Rachelle Washington,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,The name Stapleton is part of racism. It needs to go.

2,151698104,Darin Wentz,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,14 Jun,Hold on a minute I miss something please enlighten me how is Stapleton a racist word explain please
3,151698104,Aman Ellis,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Jun,Stapleton is named after Mayor Stapleton who was in the KKK.
4,151698104,Chris Nelson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,"Jude Wolf here‚Äôs what we can do in our city. A majority of the families in Montbello lost their jobs due to covid. Many of these families don‚Äôt know where their next meal is coming from. So let‚Äôs take the money they are spending on this name change and donate it to that cause. These folks are our neighbors, friends, etc. üëç"
5,151698104,Aj Stack,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,I would rather do this! To change the name just pushes money around through bureaucratic channels. Why can‚Äôt the money go directly to the people that need it?
6,151698104,Stephen Cochrane,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,"The root of the problem is we as home owners are losing our right to vote in the name of acceptance, as a homeowner in this association we are permitted a vote and that‚Äôs being taken away it seems, and that‚Äôs the real problem"
7,151698104,Cynthia Ivers,‚Ä¢ Lowry,14 Jun,"How can the HOA get around the governing documents? It requires a super majority for the name change. If they want to change the procedure of naming, a simple majority (I believe) of the owners is required. Either way, a vote is required."
8,151698104,Chris Nelson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,Yes I agree! Please send me my ballot so that I can vote NO!
9,151698104,Rachelle Washington,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Jun,Is that a no not to change the name.
10,151698104,Jon Krauss,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,15 Jun,I agree make substance changes instead of spending your capital on this.
11,151698104,Don Troike,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,"If NASCAR can ban confederate flags, the military change the name of its bases, and southern states pull down confederate monuments, we can change a name that similarly symbolizes the KKK's acts of terror. I voted no last time; I will vote for a new name this time."
12,151698104,Chris Nelson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,"Aman Ellis There are military bases named after Confederate Generals, statues that honor them, states that still fly the flag. There are even words and phrases that we all use daily that are racist. It just doesn‚Äôt stop after you take the name Stapleton off of things."
13,151698104,Keegan Perkins,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,"It doesn‚Äôt symbolize that though. You‚Äôre not even from here apparently. I don‚Äôt think anyone around here was going to Stapleton Airport trembling in fear, or upset about the name. It meant jobs for many."
14,151698104,Dennis Campbell,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,"Truth is we folded to a threat from a non-Stapleton resident and liberal pressure.  Apparently our residential votes dont count, as we have been thru this several times."
15,151698104,Chris Nelson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,"Dennis Campbell thanks! I just don‚Äôt see how this is going to solve anything? Like I said previously, if this name change is someone‚Äôs civil rights moment then we are missing the boat here. Systemic racism is the real issue here, not some dumb name that nobody cares about."
16,151698104,Jessica Bonelli,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,"Maybe someone can help me with something I have been wondering about. If all these symbols, people and statues are offensive and I could see how there are, how is it that the black community tolerates very offensive language by black rap artists? You know which word I am referring to. It is confusing to me. Thanks!"
17,151698104,Cynthia Ivers,‚Ä¢ Lowry,14 Jun,Good point.
18,151698104,Jessica Bonelli,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,"Chris Nelson- understood, I just think that if not everyone tolerates it that we would hear about more push back from the black community?  I think it can be confusing to those of us who are white. Maybe black leaders and celebrities should denounce it, because it IS offensive."
19,151698104,Chris Nelson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,"Jessica Bonelli - I understand that, but there are MUCH bigger issues than music. You can turn music off, systemic racism is Ingrained in the very fabric of American life. "
20,151698104,Jessica Bonelli,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jun,Chris Nelson I really appreciate your points and yes there are much bigger problems.

23,151698104,Jeanette Baust,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,15 Jun,Good idea. There are plenty of really good people to celebrate if it has a person's name.
24,151698104,Gerald Tafoya,‚Ä¢ Central Park,17 Jun,"No, it should not reflect any one person! That‚Äôs why we are in discussing this now! Centralization and most ppl seem to use Central Park and there is a road named Central Park."
25,151698104,Jasmine Naranjo,‚Ä¢ Beeler Park,14 Jun,Didn‚Äôt they do a vote about the name change last year and it was voted by the people that live in Stapleton to keep the name? ü§î
26,151698104,Cynthia Ivers,‚Ä¢ Lowry,14 Jun,"Yep.Apparently, there is going to be another vote."
27,151698104,Darin Wentz,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,15 Jun,Jessica you took the words out of my mouth certainly you can turn music off but not before the kids hear it and start singing along with it
28,151698104,Chris Nelson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Jun,Darin Wentz - Let me get this straight: if we get rid of Rap then the police will stop killing unarmed black men and systemic racism disappears? Fair enough ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

4,159248671,Cristiane P.,‚Ä¢ Englewood Area 3,25 Aug,Thank you! We just move to the area and on my last house (in Florida) we changed it every single month. Here the maintenance guy said they change 2x a year. I was like üòÆ. We ask them to come and check (so I could see where it is located) and for sure now I‚Äôll change more frequently because we‚Äôre the ones breathing it.

I don't think every month is needed (if it is you have other issues causing this that need to be fixed) but twice a year is what i do, between seasons.  every quarter isn't bad either, i just found with my set up twice is year is fine, my filter isn't even that dirty after 6 months.  Also a pro tip, DO NOT buy the most expensive strongest filters, it makes your unit work extra hard.  I buy the mid grade, red package Filtrete.(edited)"

8,154989844,Colin Griffith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Jul,The cool thing about our trash cans is that you can close them and not smell the smells.
9,154989844,Tammy Rudolph,‚Ä¢ Central Park,16 Jul,I get your frustration but your not reaching your target audience.
10,154989844,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Jul,"It has taken decades for people to create a culture of picking up all the dog crap on lawns, sidewalks, everywhere else. If this is all you have to complain about, you are more than welcome to step into it. There are not enough trash bins out there. Be grateful that there are caring neighbors who pick up after their dogs. I've seen plenty of places littered with stinky dog remains."
11,154989844,Genn La,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,16 Jul,Or let us know where you live and we will let our dogs poop in your lawn and not pick it up because it will stink up you TRASH can. SMH

14,154989844,Ann Burke,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,42w,"Long Do is right though! In Stapleton it is really easy to carry poop bags to public trash cans. There are so many! Stapleton requires personal trash bins to be stored out of sight, which forces alot of residents to have to store them in their garage. It is so smelly even with lid shut. When in Stapleton, use the public dog waste trash cans. Every other block.(edited)"
15,154989844,Jim Paige,‚Ä¢ Lowry,16 Jul,I completely agree. Nothing worse than putting out your trash bins in the morning then bringing them in after work and then finding out the next day but your garage stinks like dog poop. Especially when I don‚Äôt have a dog
16,154989844,Dani Truesdale,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,16 Jul,"Long Do has every right to not want another person's dog's poop in his trash can, especially if he's paying for the service. personally, I would prefer someone to take their dog poop with them, but if my trash bins are out, I'd rather a person throw the poop bag in my trash cans instead of throwing it on the sidewalk, yard or street."
17,154989844,Michelle Ku,‚Ä¢ Lowry,16 Jul,"I can't believe that people cannot understand that non-pet owners don't want other people's pet's crap in their garbage.   Cans are supposed to be kept in your garage in Lowry & Stapleton and they sure do stink in this heat, even with the lids closed.  People without pets don't have them because they don't want to deal with their waste, among other reasons.  Have some courtesy and keep the crap for your own cans."
18,154989844,Patricia Smith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Jul,"Agreed. Since this discussion thread is to all of the neighborhoods, some enjoy the privilege of community trash as they walk their dogs; others do not. 1) Pick up your dog's waste 2) dispose of it ideally in your own bin, or - 3) dispose of it in a park/community bin. The world over one sees people not doing this. Sure, it should be better. The whole point is to keep the waste off of the streets, away from parks where people congregate and it's a health issue, and IDEALLY, out of private trash bins. 'Nuff said."
19,154989844,Angela Smith,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,16 Jul,"I totally agree, I don't want anybody's waste in my trash can ever.  Please!"
20,154989844,Kat M.,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,16 Jul,"I never understood this line of thought. Can someone explain, nicely please, why it is such a big deal? The waste is in its own bag so poo won‚Äôt get inside the bin."
21,154989844,Jessica Heinzen,‚Ä¢ Central Park,16 Jul,We are required to keep the trash cans in our garage in Stapleton. Not everyone has a side yard to keep their trash can and the HOA has a panic attack if the trash can is left outside. So dog poop for an entire week in a hot garage in 100 degree heat is not exactly the best smelling situation. Especially when it starts to make your car stink and seeps inside your house. Eww.

1,160123152,John Hutchison,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,2 Sep,"I got a night owl system for 300 from Wal-Mart. 6 cameras, pretty easy to install. Has a free app to Monitor on smartphone"

4,160123152,John Hutchison,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,2 Sep,This is the one i bought
5,160123152,Alec Hogan,‚Ä¢ Del Mar North,2 Sep,"I use a Safevant system. 175$ for 4 cameras and a box capable of 8 cameras. 120$ for hard drive. I purchased another 175$ kit for the 4 additional cameras and have all 8 setup currently. Easy to use app on phone and with the harddrive I purchased my system records 24/7 on all 8 cameras for the previous month. All wireless internet cameras with the option to hardwire to ethernet. The customer service helped me set whole system up in 45 minutes. Which included setting specific cameras to motion detection notification, only during specific hours of the day/night. Each camera does have to have it's own power outlet to work. So me personally had to add some extra hidden outlets. But could easily have still setup system without doing so. I am overall extremely satisfied with the safevant brand and picture quality. Also, additional features that can be bought are speakers so you can talk through the app on phone and also sirens so you can set off a loud sound to scare off anyone who shouldnt be lurking around. I've only been in the neighborhood for about 2 years and I've had the aurora homicide unit reach out to me twice now for specific vehicles involved in shootings. Any questions just PM me and I can answer to the best of my knowledge!"
6,160123152,Chuck H L.,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,2 Sep,Where can I order one from?
7,160123152,Alec Hogan,‚Ä¢ Del Mar North,2 Sep,Chuck H Longoira Amazon is where I purchased all my items. This is the setup I bought. Currently unavailable but there looks to be a 8 camera system available in stock. I still recommend a 4tb hard drive for lengthy video storage.

11,160123152,Zack Westlie,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,3 Sep,"If you're looking for affordable options, wyze cams can be a good option. Just don't get the outdoor one, just get the regular wyze cam v2 and put it under an eve or just something to keep the rain from directly soaking it. I've had 4 of them and have been extremely happy.

2,141678525,Rafael Lopez,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Mar 20,"Well, medically you can die from alcohol withdrawal if you have alcoholism. I imagine the liquor store closures were rescinded to avoid the city having an influx of homeless folks into the ER for withdrawal symptoms."

5,141678525,Tony Salvo,‚Ä¢ Central Park,1y,I'm curious to see if we have a spike in active COVID cases with the large amount of people gathering at the liquor stores last night.  Most stores had a 30+ minute wait to get in the doors.(edited)
6,141678525,Tree Wallace,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Mar 20,"no, they were on line about 6 feet apart!"
7,141678525,Sharon Tave,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,1y,I believe it is because a lot of people would go into withdrawals which in turn would overwhelm our healthcare systems.  The same with the the virus if a number of people needed hospitalization because of the spread of the virus it would deplete what little supplies they have now and overwhelm our facilities and be put in the same position as Italy.  We should have been ordered to shelter in place two weeks ago.(edited)

Equally pathetic is Hancock caving that quickly to the pressure. For god's sake, if they are alcoholics or pot addicts (yes, people do get addicted to pot), just drive one town over (for now)."
13,141678525,Elaine Taniwaki,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Mar 20,"I thought the very same.  I was returning from an errand in south Denver, driving back in to central Denver on northbound Logan.  Smooth sailing because there just aren't many cars on the road, until traffic came to a screeching halt at Louisiana Avenue.  Why?  The traffic was backed up waiting to get into the liquor store Logan & Mississippi.  Same story a mile and a-half further north, cars lined up to get to the liquor store on Bayaud."

3,139426729,Karen K.,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,4 Mar 20,Is this the Safeway in Lowery or on Havana ?
4,139426729,Jan H.,‚Ä¢ Lowry,4 Mar 20,This is the Lowry Safeway at 200 Quebec St

8,139426729,Denise Williams,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,4 Mar 20,They have been banned from the Wendys on Ulster as well. The woman is verbally aggressive and the boy is physically aggressive punching a random customer about 5 years old in the face. I was hoping after that incident the police would have at least found help for the boy
9,139426729,Amy Bryer,‚Ä¢ Lowry,4 Mar 20,Thank you Jan. She approached my car last week as I was leaving and gave me the double ‚Äúbird‚Äù when I shook my head ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I worry about her young son. This is not the first time I have read about the two of them  on Nextdoor. The little boy appears to be very young school age if not preschool. She was pulling the gray hoodie up around her head as she approached my car but I don‚Äôt have much other description.
10,139426729,Jan H.,‚Ä¢ Lowry,4 Mar 20,"Adam I re-read that whole thread, and there are alot of similarities and in fact, it might very well be the same woman and child."

12,139426729,Kathryn Studer,‚Ä¢ Lowry,1y,"Fyi, when adults are panhandling with whom are assumed to be their children, social services should be called. I am a teacher and was recently made aware that this is considered a mandatory reporting situation. I have not seen this person but if you are a teacher, doctor, etc you must call social services and report. I would think the police reported this to social services but not sure. Clearly, not an appropriate adult to be taking care of a child.(edited)"
13,139426729,Jamie Tenace Tenace,‚Ä¢ Lowry,4 Mar 20,Is she African American?   I‚Äôm just wondering if this is her w her 7 year old son   He looks that age   If so I have a bad story about her

15,139426729,Debra Persico,‚Ä¢ Windsor North,4 Mar 20,"She just flipped me the bird in the Safeway parking lot about 30 minutes ago because I told her no! She comes right up to your car door  (I had just parked) so beware when you are getting out of it. Agitated enough,  she may try to grab your purse if you are not careful.  The young boy was with her today too. Thanks for the heads up on Social Services."
16,139426729,Jan H.,‚Ä¢ Lowry,4 Mar 20,"Jose- Not sure who you are directing your comments to, but this thread is intended as a notification of an unsafe situation. "
17,139426729,Jose Contreras,‚Ä¢ Lowry,4 Mar 20,"Were you physically assaulted or harmed by them? If not, ignore them. You did the right thing if you think they were going to assault you, but if they didn't and all they did was make you upset, they're probably not breaking the law or going to harm anyone."
18,139426729,Kirk Wayland,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,1y,"I‚Äôm tired of hearing the ‚ÄúDenver is expensive‚Äù excuse for bad behavior. Be a good person and most of the time you‚Äôll get what you give. Socioeconomic status doesn‚Äôt entitle anyone to threaten and intimidate the community around them, rich or poor. Just reading through all these posts, she is clearly a nuisance. A welfare check on the kid needs to happen. I appreciate being made aware.(edited)"
19,139426729,Kathy Shaw,‚Ä¢ Central Park,4 Mar 20,"Based on the description there is more going on than just bad behavior. It sounds like she has a mental illness, addiction, or possibly both. Definitely needs intervention from professional people and the DPD.  Especially the child - Child Protective Services needs to be contacted."
20,139426729,Beth Mullin,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,4 Mar 20,Ridiculous. What the heck. Why don‚Äôt the police do something? Their non enforcement just leads to more problems.
21,139426729,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,5 Mar 20,Because according to an officer at District 2 they ‚Äúhave bigger things to worry about like prostitution and drugs.‚Äù They don‚Äôt care ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
22,139426729,Karen K.,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,5 Mar 20,Also I think it‚Äôs Hancock‚Äôs position to let the homeless exsist and the rest of us can just put up with it. He doesn‚Äôt want to be seen as not welcoming to the homeless.

29,139426729,Emily May,‚Ä¢ Mir Park,1y,"Sad situation, especially the boy‚Äôs.  Continual exposure to his mother‚Äôs behavior - regardless of her diagnosis - will have far reaching effects for the rest of his life.  His age group is vulnerable to traumatic neuro damage from the abuse. The police are not using good judgment.  Law enforcement officers whose work includes contact with children need additional training/degrees for the above reasons.  Their involvement could make a big difference in the boy‚Äôs life outcome.(edited)"

2,155782145,Amy Webb,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,23 Jul,"Giovanna Lares yes! Use every day for a few weeks and they will start disappearing. They even work on scars that are years old, just takes longer to see results.  I think they sell it at CVS/walgreens and on Amazon."
3,155782145,Giovanna Lares,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Jul,"Thank you, just might try it!"
4,155782145,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Jul,"They will fade by themselves. December was not that long ago. I had some surgery on my wrist and I had this big red slash that I was very self-conscious about but it's almost invisible now. It takes a while until you think it's going to look like that forever, and then it just kind of fades away. Maybe some of the suggestions will work and make it go away faster. Otherwise, time and patience will do it, too."

10,155782145,Jenny Rice,‚Ä¢ Lowry,23 Jul,Plastic surgeons say silicone strips are really the only proven thing that works. I used them after my c section and on my neck and it did take time but definitely worked! You can get them on amazon.
11,155782145,Kelsie Geyer,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Jul,"Look for all natural Vitamin C serum, with retinol and hyaluronic acid. Also, you can check out Zero Market at any of their locations and ask them to make you a ""anti-scar"" serum. They use fantastic, all organic and natural oils."
12,155782145,Kelsie Geyer,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Jul,"As a side note, my understanding is that baking soda will be very harsh to use on the skin and may cause irritation."
13,155782145,Monica Rose,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Jul,"I've heard that Clarins Double Serum works wonders, but it is NOT safe if you have a latex allergy!"

16,155782145,Libra Gray,‚Ä¢ Montbello,24 Jul,"Whatever you use, I‚Äôd recommend wearing sunscreen during the day. I‚Äôve seen good results with a retinol but without sunscreen they actually come back darker!"

18,155782145,Jan H.,‚Ä¢ Lowry,24 Jul,"Libra, you make an important point. Scars do need more protection from the sun, with sunscreen and if on your face, wear a hat with a brim also. "
19,155782145,Abby Zimmerman,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Jul,Vitamin e gel capsules. Get them from any store and pierce the capsule itself with a pin/needle. Then rub the gel directly on the scar daily. It will take some time but I‚Äôve seen great results on my own skin
20,155782145,Marian Kerner,‚Ä¢ Montbello,27 Jul,"What's the source of the scars? Are these keloid scars? If so, your doctor can inject them with steroid to kill the keloiding. Get some roll on ScarAway and use it twice a day. I tell you this because I had severe surgery on my face for skin cancer last Nov. I now have very smooth area."

0,159191877,Alisa Wilson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,24 Aug,Congrats on the kittty! One thing you can do is just put him in the litter box a lot that will reinforce it in his head. Unfortunately they do have accidents.  There is an orange spray you can by which will make the area unappealing to them to go in the same spot. Also just get a carpet cleaner for pets and spray it. It will clean up the carpet well. I have 3 cats and a dog.
1,159191877,Nathalie Landeau,‚Ä¢ Central Park,24 Aug,"Clean the spot ( and any future spots) with an enzymatic cleaner, like Nature‚Äôs Miracle.  You can get it at Petsmart or Petco or order it through chewycom. It is important that it is an enzymatic cleaner so they no longer can smell the spot where they had the prior issue.  If it continues to happen you may want to have the kitten checked by a vet but occasional accidents when they are this young do occur."
2,159191877,Kay Mydosh,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Aug,Wow thank you for such a detailed and thoughtful response!  I‚Äôll be getting some enzymatic cleaner today. He is so sweet and I just want to give him the best life possible. I also really like the two litter box suggestion! Thank you!
3,159191877,Kristin Baird,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Aug,Kay Mydosh definitely keep the box clean. I scoop mine 2-3 times daily. It sounds like he is just a little scared and overwhelmed- he‚Äôll be out and about in no time! Good luck!
4,159191877,Tas Frashure,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Aug,Nature‚Äôs Miracle is just that. It neutralizes the area where he went and so it won‚Äôt be a repeat area for him. Congrats on your kitty!
5,159191877,Lisa Kelley,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,24 Aug,"Feliway at petsmart is a pheromone diffuser that gives off a calm odor.  Also,  my kitties love ""fleece"" throw blankets.  Walmart has them.  They knead them and purr like it's their mama's tummy."
6,159191877,Diane Whitcomb,‚Ä¢ Locust St,24 Aug,"It takes a while for cats to adjust to a new space.  Let him come out from under the bed at his own pace. Don‚Äôt rush him, but make sure to give him lots of positive reinforcement when he does.  Keep the box in the room for a few days m, so if his anxiety level is high, he can still get there without additional stress."
7,159191877,Kay Mydosh,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Aug,Luckily my school and my work is all remote for this year so I will be able to give him a ton of attention all day every day. Thank you for the advice!
8,159191877,Cynthia Ivers,‚Ä¢ Lowry,37w,Natures Miracle or Oxiclean with Orange will do the trick. This is Normal for kittens to have accidents.(edited)
9,159191877,Kay Mydosh,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Aug,Thank you so much for all the amazing suggestions everyone!! I really appreciate it and I‚Äôm going to buy some natures miracle this morning!
10,159191877,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,25 Aug,"I have a Bengal male who refuses to pee and poo in the same litter box, so I have 2. You may want to try that just in case. Furthermore, he likes the litter box to be cleaned a couple times a day. If I am remiss in my duties, he will poo literally right in front of his preferred poo litter box. "
11,159191877,Audrey Morrison,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Aug,I just moved houses with a 9 1/2 year old cat who started to the issues with the move.  So this advice has all been very helpful to me!!  Thanks!
12,159191877,shannon quillian,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,25 Aug,I had a kitten that did that and what I did was repeatedly put him in the litter box and wound praise him every time he used the box   It worked!
13,159191877,Kathleen McChesney,‚Ä¢ Lowry,25 Aug,"Eco-88 is the absolute best for pet accidents!  I have numerous cats and ran a rescue in Texas, so I have tried a lot of products.  This one (available on Amazon) is the best."
14,159191877,James Cannata,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Aug,Keep cat litter box cleaned daily or twice daily also. I would just repetitively put the kitten/cat into the litter over and over throughout the day. My guess is this will stop. Anytime my cats did this it was transient and ended. I did these two things though.
15,159191877,Robert Bower,‚Ä¢ Central Park,25 Aug,Hate to tell you but try anything you want - cat pee smell won‚Äôt go away. Suggest you take up your rugs (hope you don‚Äôt have wall to wall). Cat feels safe under bed. At least it‚Äôs not in living room. Hopefully cat will stop this behavior as he/she adjusts to you. Maybe a second liter box upstairs on a large plastic sheet may tempt cat. Good luck. Tough problem.
16,159191877,Kathleen McChesney,‚Ä¢ Lowry,25 Aug,Eco 88 really will kill the smell - no need to replace carpet.
17,159191877,Amy Webb,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,25 Aug,"Echoing what others said, Nature's Miracle Enzyme cleaner, there's also ""cat attract"" litter and a can of little pellets you shake into the litter box that attracts them to their box.  Also, cats tend to shy away from their litter box if there is something that they perceive as scary or threatening between them and the box.  That can be anything from a strange smell (candle, essential oil diffuser, perfume) or something loud (music, vacuum) that they want to avoid. I'd also suggest getting a little covered bed to give him a place to feel secure. Also having two boxes for him to choose from might help, and keep them extra clean!"
18,159191877,Amy Webb,‚Ä¢ Morris Heights,25 Aug,"I wanted to add I adopted a young cat who had issues with her old owner before I adopted her (he put her in the bath tub every time she pooped so she stopped using her box, and he returned her to the shelter) and she peed outside her litter box once on her second day and hid under the bed for about 3 days after we adopted her. She really came out of her shell the next few days and weeks and never hides anymore or pees outside her box. Visit him a lot and help him feel safe and the next week or two I bet he will acclimate a lot!"
19,159191877,Lynne Gordon,‚Ä¢ Montbello,25 Aug,Go to Facebook and join the Cats In Places group. Its a great place for advice and fun cat pictures!
20,159191877,Kristen Winkel,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Aug,He‚Äôll figure it out. Some cats are very picky and the box needs to be scooped every day.  Make sure the box is in a private place.
21,159191877,John Pastirchak,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,37w,"Yes, scoop the litter box clean at least twice daily.  If the habit continues, try a different brand of litter.  Also, some cats don't like scented litter.  If you're using scented, consider switching to UN-scented.  I recommend unscented & super-clumping ""EverClean"" which, last I looked, is available at most Pet supply stores.(edited)"
22,159191877,Beverly Morlock,‚Ä¢ Beeler Park,25 Aug,"All good advice! If you have not already had your kitten checked by a vet - do that soon. That will rule out health issues. Until the odor disappears, you might block your kitten's access to under your bed. Because your house is a huge unfamiliar place for your kitten, it's best to limit its space for a while.  Place the kitten in a small room with its litter box & food/water. Provide a covered box with bedding inside. Visit with your kitten for social time"
23,159191877,Beverly Morlock,‚Ä¢ Beeler Park,25 Aug,"Whoops, hadn't finished, visit with your kitten in its room for cuddles, play/social time & food. But otherwise, leave it by itself for sleeping. After a day or so, gradually increase its access to a larger space, but return the kitten to its small, familiar space for food & rest. Let your kitty explore the larger house space at its own pace. Soon, it will own the house and allow you access to it, if you are nice! üòÑ"

0,152936207,Matthew Lee,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,26 Jun,"Why not add a poll to this post?  That way people can opine with a single click if they choose. Gardner's seat looks to be one of the least secure in the Senate, so I think people who are going to vote D should vote for the person who best represents their values."
1,152936207,Justin Retzlaff,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,26 Jun,I didn‚Äôt do a poll because I want Heer what people have to say.  Not just one or the other.
2,152936207,Andrea Lewellyn,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,26 Jun,Romanoff!  Hickenlooper too wishy washy for me.
3,152936207,Barbara Williams,‚Ä¢ Lowry,29 Jun,Check their records
4,152936207,Trish Philbrook,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,26 Jun,There is a poll this morning that can be accessed here : http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=a8ccbb6d-abd4-4943-8969-7040eb37d327&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun&utm_campaign=95c18a2477-Unaffiliated-20190115_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_2e5f9a0f1b-95c18a2477-44366825&mc_cid=95c18a2477&mc_eid=6f8ad5cc1d
5,152936207,Bryan Hilton,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,27 Jun,"Hick does have name recognition and that is big, but it‚Äôs time to vote for issues and change.  If you look at the issues Romanoff has always supported the issues that are overwhelmingly popular.  You can follow the flock which got us where we are now with trump or you can vote for change that will help us.  Romanoff can easily win against Gardner, I didn‚Äôt see that question."
6,152936207,James Jenkins,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,26 Jun,Romanoff has a tendency to side with Republicans.  I don't think he can beat Gardner which needs to happen.
7,152936207,Prilla OConnell,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jun,Romanoff is the progressive candidate and does not side with Republicans. Hick is much more aligned with republican policy!
8,152936207,Matthew Lee,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,26 Jun,"Hickenlooper acts like a Republican on many issues and acts to protect the establishment and his own interests first, offering milquetoast support for the average Coloradan. I was not impressed with his time as mayor or governor. Haven't we had enough of him?  Romanoff appears more like a real public servant to me. I think anyone with a D wins this seat over Gardner and am sick and tired of fear-based Dems voting for their team and the ""safe"" candidate instead of anyone who might effect meaningful change."
9,152936207,Marisa Baldwin,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,26 Jun,Agreed.
10,152936207,Kathryn Studer,‚Ä¢ Lowry,45w,Agreed that Gardner needs to be replaced but vote for the candidate that you feel represents your views best. I agree that Romanoff is much more a public servant and Hickenlooper more of a politician. I prefer a servant at this point. Especially with Hickenlooper thinking he was above showing up for court. Ugh.(edited)
11,152936207,Marisa Baldwin,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,28 Jun,Exactly.  We would go to jail.  Just showed who he really is.
12,152936207,Paul Sidey,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,29 Jun,Lol
13,152936207,Nancy Arko,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,26 Jun,"Romanoff has spent a great deal of time working on this campaign. He has been diligent about house parties, town halls and getting out there to meet people and see what they think and how they feel. Hick just decided late that since he didn‚Äôt get very far with Prez campaign he would go for the Senate. I don‚Äôt feel he‚Äôs really put his heart and soul in it the way Andrew has, but was relying on name recognition to get him in. "
14,152936207,Marisa Baldwin,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,28 Jun,Well said.
15,152936207,Heather Bays,‚Ä¢ Lowry,26 Jun,Thanks everyone for keeping the discussion civil. Politics are a tricky subject on ND.
16,152936207,Jeff Mason,‚Ä¢ Lowry,26 Jun,"While I have nearly always appreciated Hickenlooper as a city and state leader, and I would be comfortable with him as a CO senator, I am giving my primary vote to Romanoff. Romanoff's positions are more aligned with my progressive values. I worry that Hick's time has passed and even if elected, he could not keep up with the scope of change and vision I think our country needs from its leaders. If Hick wins, but the race is close, I hope he will recognize progressive ideas have support in this state. If Hick looses, I believe Romanoff will be very capable in a debate with Gardner and his campaign will be supported by the voters and the party."
17,152936207,Amber Camus,‚Ä¢ Central Park,26 Jun,"Romanoff. Hickenlooper‚Äôs stance on many issues is too conservative for my tastes and he often tries to reframe his previous positions. Drinking fracking fluid? That was actually a move to get oil and gas companies on board with regulation. After seeing the way public opinion was blowing on gun control, he started to support tightening gun laws as governor but instead of acknowledging his stance changed, he tried to claim he was in support of such measures all along and championed it as an issue when he was a presidential candidate. He comes off as disingenuous at best to me."
18,152936207,Elaine Taniwaki,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,45w,"Joyce Springer, please explain how Romanoff's loss of ""two big campaigns"" translates to his abilities?  "
19,152936207,Karla Simons,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jun,"Despite who you may like best, Hickenlooper is our best chance to take seat from Gardner which, I‚Äôm afraid, is more important than like-ability. It‚Äôs the part of politics that is unfortunate but a reality nonetheless.  That‚Äôs why Republicans have taken out ads against Hickenlooper. They know they can beat Romanoff."
20,152936207,Bryan Hilton,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,27 Jun,"Issues are winning this year, hick isn‚Äôt even trying.  Sure republicans want a republican lite to win to keep the status quo.  What issues are important to you?"
21,152936207,Veronica Figoli Fleischer,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jun,HIckenlooper
22,152936207,Bryan Hilton,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,27 Jun,Why?
23,152936207,Michele McManus,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,26 Jun,"The most important, basically the only thing I care about is beating gardner. Romanoff served in the State House for 8 years. Romanoff  lost twice, once to Bennett and once to Coffman. Hick won 4 times, 2 times statewide. Easy choice."
24,152936207,Bryan Hilton,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,27 Jun,"Do you have any issues you support Hickenlooper over Romanoff, Elliot Engel won for. Decades, was a party chair and had washington support.  Times are changing.  Vote your conscience."
25,152936207,Rachel Grossman,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,26 Jun,"Michelle, I 100% agree."
26,152936207,Bryan Hilton,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,45w,"Issues?  Times are changing unless you don‚Äôt want change.  Romanoff has a passion for change, have you seen Hickenlooper?  I cannot support what I‚Äôve seen from Hickenlooper, no passion, just status quo which I hope people don‚Äôt want anymore.(edited)"
27,152936207,Lois Peterson,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,26 Jun,I‚Äôm supporting Romanoff. He‚Äôs been criticized for a 2007 decision that he now acknowledges was a mistake. 
28,152936207,Diane Grove,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,26 Jun,"Definitely Romanoff.  The Democratic Party gave all of their funding to Hickenlooper for his name recognition.  Romanoff has built his campaign through intense grassroots efforts, and he is strongly supported by Colorado‚Äôs young people.  They are behind him because he is very clear on what he believes and is not controlled by big money.  His stand on the environment, accessibility of mental and physical health support, and equal opportunity really resonate with me.  I remember when he was speaker of the CO House of Representatives. He was regularly on the news, and he was level headed and straight forward. He can definitely win against Gardner."
29,152936207,Wanda Harris,‚Ä¢ Hilltop,29 Jun,Being supported by young people is great-  but so far these same people in many parts of the country would rather not vote.  I vote for R as well-  but don‚Äôt count on young people for more than what they do on social media.  (Helpful free media but not the same as a vote.) Where are their -  I VOTED stickers?
30,152936207,Bryan Hilton,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,26 Jun,"Romanoff had really thought out his positions and Hickenlooper seems to be copying some of Romanoff‚Äôs positions now just because he doesn‚Äôt have much on his own.  I was amazed when during a debate he complained he was being asked to answer first too many times, I assumed it was difference because he held a higher position, but it wasn‚Äôt a true leader.  Hick is a status quo candidate in a time of change.  He also has the ethics issue which could cost him in the general election.  Thanks for voting!"
31,152936207,Kevin L.,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,26 Jun,"Romanoff for sure. Hickenpooper should try to go impress people with his banjo skills, run his restaurants while buying up all the real estate in Denver."
32,152936207,Brian Plummer,‚Ä¢ Central Park,45w,Sit. Stay. Roll Over. We aren‚Äôt dogs but its a good thing you said and go or we wouldn‚Äôt have had any idea what to do.(edited)

0,154027045,Frank Barnhart,‚Ä¢ Aurora,6 Jul,Bed bugs are a simple pain to get rid of. Ive had friends who have done the heat treatment with much sucess. You can try and heat up the house to at least 120 degrees for roughly 2 hours min to kill them.
1,154027045,Ivette Esquivel,‚Ä¢ Aurora,6 Jul,Thank you Frank!
2,154027045,Nosheen Jacob,‚Ä¢ Aurora Arts District,6 Jul,"Diatect Bed Bug Killer. I think it costs around $10 a  bottle. You have to be meticulous with it all around the house and on the bed, box spring couch etc. for a few months. Gets rid of all of them."

4,154027045,Sharon Duwaik,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Jul,"Having bedbugs has nothing to do with cleanliness---all they want is blood, not dirty tidbits!  But if you have clutter, they are harder to get rid of---so getting rid of extra stuff is good.  If you have to throw out any furniture make sure to cut it up or mark it, other wise someone will take your furniture (and problems) home with them."
5,154027045,Rebecca Thompson,‚Ä¢ Del Mar North,6 Jul,"Wash, dry and bag all clothes, bedding, or personal stuff you can live without for a month, and buy a steam shark. The steam cracks the shell of the bug, and kills eggs."
6,154027045,Brenda Jendraszkiewicz,‚Ä¢ Del Mar North,6 Jul,"Food grade diatomaceous earth. It cracks open a bugs exoskeleton and they dry out and die. You can buy a big bag on amazon for $20ish. Just make sure it‚Äôs food grade. Completely safe to use around kids and pets. Just sprinkle it everywhere there are bugs, wait 24 hours, vacuum, repeat for a few days to a week to make sure you get hatching eggs. I used it for a flea infestation and it works like a charm. Cheap and easy."

9,154027045,Curtis Zwart,‚Ä¢ Aurora,6 Jul,Look up diy pest control online. Last time I had this problem I think that I spent around $100. 
10,154027045,Carol Brown,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,6 Jul,"With this heat put lamps, small items in black trash bags and set in sun. Also can put mattresses and frames outside in sun. Wash what you can then sit in sun. My friend did this after washing clothes, pillows, etc. And left them outside for 2-3 hot days in a row."

Make a spray using 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup cinnamon. Saute on stove for 3 mins and put in a dark bottle for about a month or buy it at King Soopers pharmacy for 5.99. Have to do all the steps mentioned above. Vacuum, steam, soda, wash/dry in very hot, spray an oil. Alot of work! Good luck. N"

13,161749692,Marc Duflos,‚Ä¢ Central Park,33w,I watched it and I'm not sure what the actual message is beyond homelessness is a complicated issue. It just seems like an assembly of videos with a dramatic background music(edited)

Without a healthy educated populist with a roof over their head there will be no consumption of goods. Just a global depression.

I‚Äôm talking about out of the city travel, not looking in someone‚Äôs car and guessing. I‚Äôm not worried about people driving in cars so much. Maybe they will worry about that at some point.

5,142146326,Daniel Remsen,‚Ä¢ Central Park,26 Mar 20,I think a lot of neighbors are quarantining together. If everyone in a group is serious about keeping their group healthy then I think it is fine. We have three households that aren‚Äôt interacting with others to allow the kids some normalcy of life.
6,142146326,Margaux Milchen,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1y,"I hope that nobody pays the ultimate price then. I pray that nobody in the group has asthma of any kind. A perfectly healthy 38 year old nurse just died of the virus. He was healthy except for asthma (which lots of kids have). I would hate for anybody to suffer because they're not willing to put away their wants for a few months, or even a year. I'm not saying this to be snarky or mean. This thing scares the hell out of me. I haven't left my house in 9 days.(edited)"
7,142146326,liz weller,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,27 Mar 20,"‚ÄúIsolating‚Äù in giant groups isn‚Äôt isolating.

15,142146326,Carmen Held,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,3 Apr 20,My concern with the cigarettes is that somebody homeless or Tem will pick it up if there‚Äôs enough left on it and smoke it and then they would be exposed by touching the second on the filter
16,142146326,Antonia Dalpiaz,‚Ä¢ Lowry,26 Mar 20,Imogene I agree 100% I live in an apartment building and noticed a neighbor heading down the hallway towards me and my daughter so we stepped off to the side to give us the 6 ft distance and he blurts out just hold your breath its not a big deal. My 11 year old knows better than an adult. I yelled back Its people like you that will keep this stay at home order go on longer and longer. Some people are just ignorant.  Why can't people just follow the rules. I am all for keeping some kind of normalcy for our kids but at what expense. Stay safe
17,142146326,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,27 Mar 20,"I went out to a craft supply store on Wednesday afternoon to get materials to keep myself occupied while confined. I had two people come into the same aisle as I was and walk up and stand within two feet of me like as if that was ok. Even though I was there first, I moved away and only went back after the intruder had moved. I don't know if people are being that rude or are that unaware of what's going on or not following the news about it or don't know what they are supposed to do or what. Whatever, I found that breach of my space quite disturbing."
18,142146326,Joanne Spillman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,1y,"They don't care. This has happened to me at the grocery store. I'll just move along if they won't keep their distance. I heard two twentysomething ladies laugh at me for trying to avoid them. This isn't a joke, kids.(edited)"

WTF?  Dude...you are getting to work and still get paid...the least you could do is DO YOUR FUCKING JOB!"
20,142146326,Benjamin Conner,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,27 Mar 20,Cut the guy a break... if he didn‚Äôt have any mail for you he probably planned his route accordingly and didn‚Äôt even step on your property. Hence not noticing your outgoing mail. If it was so highly important you could simply drop it in a blue mailbox and then you wouldn‚Äôt have had to break the 6‚Äôft rule. The profanity is simply not necessary. Some common courtesy would be appreciated. I‚Äôm a courier myself. It is impossible for us to complete our jobs without interacting with coworkers or the occasional recipient/customer within the 6ft space.
21,142146326,Alice Gonzalez,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,27 Mar 20,Be careful guys people are not taking this seriously. People are making videos for goodness sake claiming to be infected and just walking aroumd stores as everyone os in a panic biy state of mind and just spreading germs every where this is just great to know that people are acting like this...

22,142146326,Mindy Carrigan,‚Ä¢ Central Park,27 Mar 20,I cannot understand why so many ppl are still out & about and how few adhere to social distancing guidelines. Makes me feel like things will go on much longer than they need to.

24,142146326,Donna Wallace,‚Ä¢ Lowry,5 Apr 20,so agree...apparently we need  a police state as we don‚Äôt get it right voluntarily

34,142146326,Jamie Higgins,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,28 Mar 20,"Any other regular runner on here knows that spitting when running, just like when your nose starts to ‚Äúrun‚Äù because it‚Äôs cold out is all part of getting rid of stuff that needs to get out of your body. Providing someone isn‚Äôt spitting Near you or close to 6 feet, please don‚Äôt complain about a runner spitting. If they make the guidelines any stricter,  people will follow them even less. We need to get outside and get fresh air- we need exercise and not everyone can invest in home equipment. You will hear advice to get outside and advice to exercise from any medical or mental health professional especially at this time when we can‚Äôt be around anyone other than our household. It is vital to mental health. This is hard enough for many without making it even more complicated.  Social distance, stay at home except for vital needs and exercise, and we will flatten the curve and get back to normalcy sooner. People constantly complaining on next door doesn‚Äôt help at all. For those complaining about the teens, perhaps their parents need to revisit this with them and re educate on the importance of social distancing and that it won‚Äôt be forever. But for a second, try to imagine what it feels like to be a child or teen right now when your friends and school are such such a huge part of your world. That was taken from them abruptly and we can‚Äôt even tell them when it will end. Friends are a huge source of support when you‚Äôre a teen. This is really hard for kids. I think some forget what that might be like. "
35,142146326,Keegan Perkins,‚Ä¢ Central Park,1y,"Spitting can be a health hazard. Not sure what the problem is with just swallowing. I understand if you got a bug in your mouth, but. One problem is someone would step in it and track it home on their shoes. Not a made up thing. Animal shelters are very aware of disease transmission, including by shoes. And there‚Äôs a reason health facilities do shoe protection as well. Spitting is also sending particles into the air, as does snot rocketing. Runnersworld had a piece recommending people refrain from spitting. I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs necessary. Use a tissue if you need to.(edited)"

We all know the statistics now, most of us watch the news, and have heard the health safety orders that are have been put into place...

He has to think of everyone. And he‚Äôs right! There are too many irresponsible dog owners. Fix that issue and it will all fall in place.

18,137304589,Rachel Gao,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,14 Feb 20,"I mean why ban dog breeds? Why not ban owners who have aggressive dogs who allow their dogs to attack over and over again? I think if our congressmen are so set on ‚Äúmaking our city safer‚Äù than ban those people who keep choosing to bring their aggressive dogs to public places/parks and have no repercussion. Not trying to start an aggressive chain of comments, just wondering why we don‚Äôt try harder to punish the people who trained (or lack thereof) an aggressive dog and have no responsibility/repercussion for their actions."

I have a puppy who was rescued from being dumped at a Dairy Queen parking lot in a box and looked to be pointer but as he has started to grow he is pit bull. All he does is cuddle. He was failed by humans once and now twice. If you met him and told me you think we should not be here that would be one thing, but you have no idea what the dogs being told they are unwelcome are really like. History has proven it VERY dangerous to have a mind like yours toward other groups."

4,154339954,Ben Miller,‚Ä¢ Central Park,12 Jul,ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. You people think meat grows on trees.  And it‚Äôs not a sport. It‚Äôs for the meat and the meat only. I don‚Äôt keep furs or trophies so don‚Äôt come at me with that shit. I try my best not to eat meat from grocery stores because I find it unethical. And I‚Äôm sorry that I can drive something because I worked my a$$ off every day unlike you
5,154339954,Tree Wallace,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,13 Jul,"No, many of us realize meat does not grow on trees - & do realize the atrocities of the ‚Äòfood animal‚Äô business.  Many of us realize the health implications of a meat eating society & make other choices.  To purposely decide to hurt & kill another living creature is pretty offensive to many & maybe u don‚Äôt want to talk about it here. There is plenty of food to eat without being hurtful. Americans eat too much protein & it is causing kidney disease! Also cancers!  Read ‚Äòthe China study‚Äô for the largest research ever done which showed the problems of an animal protein diet! "
6,154339954,Anthony Lebermann,‚Ä¢ Lowry,12 Jul,"Ben, I think your going to have a little trouble finding bear in the high country on public land this year.  Bears seem to be coming down the mountain more this year due to lack of food, high temps and no precipitation seem to have made their food source scares, Either way good Luck and happy hunting!  and pay no mind to the folks that don't understand why you hunt, I know many hunters, I am not one, but you are a good bunch of folks."
7,154339954,Ben Miller,‚Ä¢ Central Park,13 Jul,Thank you sir!!  I will try my best.
8,154339954,Hazel Shields,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,13 Jul,So you eat bears?
9,154339954,Ben Miller,‚Ä¢ Central Park,13 Jul,Yea this year the bear population is out of control.  And bear meat is super sweet and tasty. If I get one I can send you some!!!!  Just ask
10,154339954,Nora Weiker,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,13 Jul,Why didn't you just shoot them while they were hibernating. Bonus of cubs screaming.

12,154339954,Patrick S.,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,13 Jul,"First and foremost: bear hunting is legal. Second: yes, you can absolutely eat bear meat. Third: ballot-box and emotion-centered conservation policies generally speaking, SUCK!!!!!!!"

14,154339954,Patrick S.,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,43w,"I am a well-educated person, actually. I happen to also be a hunter, and I have watched all kinds of completely well-intentioned, yet totally backward Boulder-inspired nonsense pass for sound conversation policies over the past 25 years. I have also been harassed by Boulder yuppies in the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area while lawfully engaged in hunting while the person harassing me was breaking the law with their dog off leash. I chose the word 'suck' because it was the most appropriate vocabulary word to describe how people with zero scientific training along with a surplus of emotion-laden pseudo-ecological, emotional diarrhea try to drive conservation policy in this state.(edited)"
15,154339954,Patrick S.,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,13 Jul,"Nora Weiker also, Ben Miller simply asked for some information regarding his upcoming bear hunt, and you are the one that chose to chime in on his post with your own particular brand of nonsense that you are selling."

23,154339954,Ben Miller,‚Ä¢ Central Park,13 Jul,IF ANYONE IS QUESTIONING HUNTING AND IF BEAR MEAT IS EDIBLE.  ASK AND I WILL INVITE YOU UP TO HUNT WITH ME AND I CAN EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS AND WHY IT IS GOOD AND IF WE GET SOMETHING I WILL SHARE THE MEAT.  WE CAN ALSO STOP AND TALK TO MY GOOD FRIEND IN THE CPW TO EXPLAIN IT BETTER.   Please dm me if you would like to go !!!!
24,154339954,Heather Bays,‚Ä¢ Lowry,14 Jul,Ben if you have the info you need - it‚Äôs probably time to shut this post down. To do so go to the upper right hand corner of your initial post and click the little arrow thing - it will give you various options.  Thanks and good luck in your adventures.

All of the suggestions are good, because I have worked with the homeless as well.  Many have asked society to forgive for their sins, but some are not forgiving at all, but if they want to be forgiven of their sins which everyone has and really realize who the real Judge is then maybe people wouldn‚Äôt be so judgmental about everything especially on ND, seems to be a big problem.

0,176449560,Terri Mc,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,9 Feb,Put her litter box outside with some food and she can smell her way home.
1,176449560,Courtney Wright,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,9 Feb,Ive put her favorite blanket and litter box outside we are thinking someone took her in. Can you ask your neighbors or friends if they‚Äôve recently taken in a cat?
2,176449560,Terri Mc,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,9 Feb,Where are you located? Cats can travel pretty far. Have you checked ddfl under lost and found?
3,176449560,Courtney Wright,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,9 Feb,Akron St. I have not checked ddfl i‚Äôm not sure what that is
4,176449560,Courtney Wright,‚Ä¢ Aurora Cultural Arts District,9 Feb,oh actually yes i put a repost into their website on sunday

I knew this was something serious and I felt I was somewhat responsible for my brother and best friends deaths and needed to help in anyway I can... so I teamed up with one of my military buddies who also suffer from anxiety and depression... he‚Äôs managed to get his life together after being homeless for years... now he‚Äôs an entrepreneur and helps others with their anxiety... I saw how effective his Facebook group was at bringing people together and getting them to open up about their issues... so I created this group... hope that makes sense!"

3,155023218,Yvonne Bills,‚Ä¢ Windsor Gardens East,17 Jul,"Thank you for sharing - yes it does. I also experienced watching 2 people try to commit suicide suffer from depression/illness for years and again suffered after their attempts.  For me though, opening up has not always brought peace sometimes just unfair judgment.  I admire you friend immensely, I am glad his Facebook page is so successful.   For me, actual human connections with people who walk in the same shoes is what would work.  Still looking."

2,155712582,Tree Wallace,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Jul,"Actually I will now b in daily contact with the owner.  They r fed & loved on.  They get exercised every night (when owner was not in hospital).  He set up for friend to bring food & water when he went in the hospital so didn‚Äôt desert them.  He has financial issues, lack of knowledge of internet to reach out for help & maybe some other issues related to his being a loner? Many neighbors near by r also aware & offering help.  And he is willing to let us help.  His friend is helping him clean up his yard 1st.  Then I will c what my husband & I can do regarding his house. So for now they will stay with him.

8,155712582,Susan Taylor-Erdos,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,23 Jul,Where is this sweetie now? Do you know what breed he/she is? Is he/she adoptable? What a wonderful woman - another angel here on earth!
9,155712582,Tree Wallace,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Jul,"Yes - it was actually 2 dogs! - I got the one & this groomer - Keenya with Doggie Downtime offered her service for free - but - she wasn‚Äôt @ the shop till Tuesday!  I couldn‚Äôt bare to c this dog in this shape another minute!  so I ‚Äògroomed‚Äô the 1st sweetie with just a scissor! Worked for 5 hours, giving her breaks, working gently so not to jab or cut her.  In 5 hours I did the majority of her body, neck, head & face & 1 leg.  She got happier & happier. Started on the second leg (legs were like they were in casts! So tight & totally surrounded).  I couldn‚Äôt physically go on - my thumb was getting sore & numb & stayed numb for a days - still is in one spot!  The next day my husband found some electric clippers & in 2 hours time he released all the legs.  She walked around like a puppy!  She wagged her tail! She felt soooo good.  So I  lucked out & ran into the guy feeding the dogs.  I brought him to my house to show him the 1st dog & he‚Äôd know where I lived so he agreed to give me the second dog the next day!!!! Yay!  The 2nd dog was even WORSE!!!! So it was the second dog I brought to Keenya.  This woman is the kindest, sweetest human being i have ever met!  With her skills & her professional tools she got it done in under 3 hours!!!! AMAZING.  Thank God, there was no permanent damage - as there can b circulation issues or skin infections etc from severe mats!  The 2 back legs were reddened. Both dogs had a nail curled up into the foot - but no actual wound.  So nails r trimmed too.  Of course keenya did a perfect job.  We only took a touch off each nail afraid we‚Äôd hit the vein.  So I will do more & may actually bring her to keenya in a few weeks for her to finish up my ‚Äògrooming‚Äô job! ü§£"
10,155712582,Susan Taylor-Erdos,‚Ä¢ Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,23 Jul,"Tree Wallace There are not enough words to applaud you for all you have done for these dogs.  My dog is like my child and it's hard to hear stories like this BUT once again with people like you and Keenya in this world, it proves how much good there is out there!!"

25,155712582,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Jul,What happened with the big black dog? Is he ok too?
26,155712582,Tree Wallace,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,41w,He‚Äôs been great other than he gets out & runs around the park @ night.  Once he exercises he jumps back in the yard.  The owner normally runs him every night (but he‚Äôs been in the hospital for a lengthy time) - so this big dog is very lonely but he‚Äôs also very fearful.  I have not been able to catch him.  He had a sad life prior & has only been in this home since Christmas time.  I heard he was getting out last night - but hasn‚Äôt been confirmed & I‚Äôm currently out of town! I will contact another neighbor near by who has offered his help & c if he‚Äôll knock in his door .....(edited)
27,155712582,Tonia Finch Seidl,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,23 Jul,I Love Keenya and Erin! Both are great with my scared skittish rescured dog of a year!!!! Thanks for giving Doggie Downtime a shot out!!!

4,133371016,Lovie Brown,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,1 Jan 20,The judge has lost his mind. Why don‚Äôt they all to CAMP OUT HERE HE LIVES???
5,133371016,Genn La,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,1y,I agree the judges don‚Äôt care because they live in another city which has low homeless population i‚Äôm sure. I am tired of finding human poop on my driveway.(edited)
6,133371016,Anne Carpio,‚Ä¢ Clayton,1 Jan 20,Even Denver rescues mission says lifting that ban is only hurting these people.
7,133371016,Vrnda Noel,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,2 Jan 20,Unhoused people will exist with or without a ban. DRM doesn't have enough resources to help them & have offered no other solutions. Neither does the other sources of big $$. Relatively speaking they can only help a small percentage of the unhoused people so who cares where they stand on it. 
8,133371016,Kj Leon,‚Ä¢ Clayton,1 Jan 20,Anyone notice the huge influx of gentrification in the five points area. Maybe it's been there. Saw a privileged hipster walking in the middle of the night...
9,133371016,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,2 Jan 20,What is a privileged hipster?
10,133371016,Susan Young,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,1 Jan 20,Yes. It is disturbing. What to do? I read the city is appealing the decision.
11,133371016,Genn La,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,1 Jan 20,That‚Äôs what I heard.
12,133371016,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,3 Jan 20,Please look up definition of gentrification. It is ultimately a plan.
13,133371016,Don Leaderach,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,1 Jan 20,You can all thank the liberals for this. Can you say LA. And Denver is also a sanctuary city.
14,133371016,Michael Ellafrits,‚Ä¢ Central Park,1 Jan 20,"Vanessa Shewmaker I‚Äôm not quite sure this is liberal issue. And it‚Äôs certainly not something we can blame local officials on, which overwhelming supported the ban.  In fact; most residents of all political persuasions do not support overturning the camping ban, but the problem is the ninth circuit court ruled 10 years years ago that cities can‚Äôt prohibit living in public if there‚Äôs nowhere else to go.  With Denver, not a night goes by when all ‚Äúavailable‚Äù beds are filled so this shouldn‚Äôt apply to us.  Ultimately, no city wants homeless to have free reign to live wherever they want, but as a legal issue, the Supreme Court has refused to hear the case.  Why is that?  I would hope the ban could be enforced with the presumption that the city provides alternative options."

18,133371016,Brandon Scott,‚Ä¢ Skyland,1 Jan 20,Homelessness in America is a travesty. At least it‚Äôs not being swept under the rug these days.
19,133371016,Anna Noble,‚Ä¢ Central Park,1 Jan 20,"This is a human tragedy I agree. The shelters are not safe and many are not allowed in them for whatever reason and so these folks are literally trying so stay alive the best they know how. People die. Yes it it ugly and smells bad but god help us all if can not offer compassion. Here‚Äôs hoping we can offer real solutions, safe housing and loving communities to our most vulnerable. Let‚Äôs hope 2020 brings some relief to those who suffer and are in pain. Choose kindness."
20,133371016,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,3 Jan 20,"A vet came into the VA hospital before the new one was built said he had stayed in a shelter, it was infested with bugs, they had stolen his money and clothes, he was now looking for a one way ticket to his home in Florida, many vets could not stay there anyway they have PTSD and other issues. Now the new hospital has arranged for them to stay in hotels arranged for them and their families. And other places to my knowledge."
21,133371016,Pat Garland,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Jan 20,Thank you Anna for your thoughtful and compassionate response.
22,133371016,Jennifer Honegger,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,1 Jan 20,Just remember the judge‚Äôs name when it comes time for re-election!! Johnny Barajas.
23,133371016,Debra Taylor,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,1 Jan 20,Read the ruling first!
24,133371016,Don Leaderach,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,1 Jan 20,From what? I am sure some of the homeless have valid reasons why they can‚Äôt support themselves but I have read that a great number would not take a job offered.
25,133371016,Patricia Monheit,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 Jan 20,‚ÄúPeople say ...‚Äù
26,133371016,Joe Gear,‚Ä¢ Skyland,3 Feb 20,"Ive worked with the homeless for 14 years. The majority do not refuse work, but rather incapable due to mental health issues."
27,133371016,Brandon Scott,‚Ä¢ Skyland,1 Jan 20,Thanks Jennifer. I will remember come election time and I hope others will too. 
28,133371016,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,2 Jan 20,"I‚Äôve never noticed I think for the most part they had managed to keep city park free of homeless, but why not they seem to be in most parks bathroom facilities more room, I really don‚Äôt approve I really enjoy city park and the lake, the playground. Needles etc is not good."
29,133371016,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,2 Jan 20,"I think the city needs to do better but there has to be some sort of control or else we will loose safe and clean areas to take our families, what‚Äôs the choice. Do u want to take ur family to city park, where ur child could pick up a syringe to play with or no telling what might be found out city park and golf course use to be attractions for our areas, but they have torn up a beautiful golf course and now homeless in city park, Wow, where does it end? The goose poop, I never knew we had such a good shortage to kill geese in the park, excuse too much poop, well hire more city workers to clean it up. I think that is absolutely disgusting can‚Äôt even think of the word for what they r doing. Someone had a ring video of a mentally ill lady knocking on their door, finally she decided they weren‚Äôt home and she said she was going to the park to pray and kill people.OMG."
30,133371016,Brandon Scott,‚Ä¢ Skyland,2 Jan 20,"I hear ya Kathy. It can be rough out there. Keeping children safe is literally in my job description. Still, it‚Äôs better to address injustices head-on with honest communication instead of pretending they don‚Äôt exist. Homelessness, mental health and drug addiction have been around a long time and can be unpleasant to look at but I hope we can all be grateful for what we have and keep fighting the good fight for everyone in our community, not just immediate family and peers."
31,133371016,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,2 Jan 20,Many people that r homeless make that choice and many r because of life. Some just walk away from their life and choose not to be found homeless.
32,133371016,Brandon Scott,‚Ä¢ Skyland,2 Jan 20,Even if that were true it‚Äôs not logical to make sweeping judgements about a diverse and marginalized population. Lots of homeless are veterans too. I assume you‚Äôve never been homeless but have you ever helped out at a soup kitchen or shelter? You should try it sometime. It will inform you in a way that news articles and doorbell cameras can‚Äôt.
33,133371016,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,2 Jan 20,If they go to the shelters when they r already full they will not let them in. I think some of these empty buildings the city owns should be renovated in to living quarters for them.
34,133371016,Brandon Scott,‚Ä¢ Skyland,2 Jan 20,Agreed
35,133371016,Richard Boehm,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,2 Jan 20,I‚Äôm not happy with our politicians when bills like HR 5038 the Farmland Modernization act are passed that are handing out US citizenship for indentured servitude. Corrupt agribusiness wanting cheap labor while suppressing small farms
36,133371016,Debra Taylor,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Jan 20,"Richard, not one white, american has gone to the farm fields to labor.  All that HR 5038 does is protect the laborors."
37,133371016,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,2 Jan 20,"Ignorant generalizations aside, the growing homeless population isn't a single issue nor is it a single political party issue. Those who are homeless due to legitimate mental health problems or addiction problems are largely a matter of close state mental health facilities. This happened long before people were spewing hatred of one political party or the other. The economic decision to close these facilities, peaking in the 80s, has created far reaching societal and economic impacts today. I'm not sure if we can revert back to state run mental health treatment and care facilities but we should definitely explore this as an option. Abandoning and demonizing our citizens who are incapable of caring for themselves is a humanitarian crisis and a stain on each and every one of us. How a human being can look at another suffering human being and thumb their noses at them is shocking. When I read some of these comments and know these are some of the same people who claim to be religious...again, shocking. Drug treatment centers, mental health facilities, safe houses, etc. are all resources our tax dollars and volunteer time should be dedicated to. "
38,133371016,Debra Taylor,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,4 Jan 20,Well stated Liz.

Remember we can't over whelm the hospitals again with a bunch of sick people. Who will care for you or anyone else who gets the virus if the hospitals don't have staff. There was already a shortage of nurses prior to the pandemic. Nurses having to work 12 hour shifts away from their family and any social life.

I guess antibiotics wouldn‚Äôt even work I‚Äôm confused is it just a death sentence it‚Äôs like why bother even if a systematic is that what we are looking for, no matter what you should be wearing a mask. Saw a lady trying to go into Walmart and they said no mask no come in, then I was in line at Walmart Stapleton and they were going down the line giving them to people. I have seen young and old running around without a mask like it‚Äôs not going to happen to them, I think there is something I am missing I even bought gloves. I went to the beauty shop today, it was not business as usual, have to say I kinda liked it. It certainly was not as busy which got me out faster, there was social distancing I was talking to my beautician and she had someone in her chair she politely told me i needed to step back 6 ft. No worries I appreciated her concern for following the rules. She was very cognizant of the guidelines and following them."

27,147635005,Clay S.,‚Ä¢ South Mar Lee/Brentwood,10 May 20,China and the nature of their government have historically lied about this and leadership of our country in the past has reacted accordingly. Trump is obviously not prepared to be a leader and still is not making testing and contact tracing a priority. Trump has a lot of blame to take during this yet he refuses to take any blame.

Also, and most importantly, what about our children's education and mental health? DPS is already offering in-person and remote learning options so I'm not sure what the point of your petition is.(edited)"
1,154660333,Maureen F.,‚Ä¢ Central Park,12 Jul,"I get it - it‚Äôs sign if you agree.  If you don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs on behalf of my sister who‚Äôs a teacher.  I certainly respect any viewpoints on this, and make no claim that this is the right viewpoint.  The whole situation is horrible and I don‚Äôt believe there is any good solution."
2,154660333,Wyatt Whorton,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,15 Jul,"I get your standpoint. It‚Äôs a tough one. It sucks for teachers and other onsite staff. I work for DoTS at DPS and there is just a difficulty of DoTS is extremely underfunded and understaffed to support complete online learning until there are no new cases for 2 weeks. We have the MyTech program for students to get Chromebooks if they do not have computers at home but we only have ~80,000 for our 90,000+ students and that doesn‚Äôt even account for extra chromebooks to replace the ones that are broken. Sadly it‚Äôs just an issue of the underfunding of the public school system in Denver"
3,154660333,Ross Crater,‚Ä¢ Central Park,12 Jul,"Terrible idea, there are never gonna be no cases for two weeks as long as the virus still exists. Even in countries that have it under control they have cases her and there, and complete lack of federal action here in The US means we‚Äôll probably rarely even have a decline in cases. All that means no school until a vaccine or for at least 6 months, which given the failures of online learning the mental health of students and struggle for parents who work is completely unreasonable. Better to plan for a safe return as best you can than make an unreasonable request of purity that could never be reached."

You are asking for $2,000 per adult per month and $1,000 per child. That all non-essential business close. That all non-essential travel stop. You are essentially saying that you are going to stay home until this completely comes to an end and you expect the government support you. No thank you. Please read before you sign.

6,154660333,Peter Higgins,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Jul,"No one is ""signing up"" for anything here. It's not a contract. Also ... That's a great plan you lay out there. But ""No thank you""? Why? Many other countries in the world are doing that. Why can't the richest country in the world afford to join them? Dare to dream. America doesn't HAVE to be a shithole. We can do better."
7,154660333,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,12 Jul,My college campus is online for the fall semester. Why shouldn‚Äôt DPS be too?
8,154660333,Adam Feerst,‚Ä¢ Lowry,13 Jul,"Sadie Martin Because it‚Äôs much less effective teaching young kids online, and many don‚Äôt have adequate technology of high speed access."
9,154660333,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Jul,"College students have a much longer attention span than 1st graders do, and have more advanced reading and critical thinking skills than young children do.I can't imagine a child wanting to deal with online classes much at all, and I can't blame them."
10,154660333,Bob Goldie,‚Ä¢ Central Park,12 Jul,"This is fine for stay-at-home parents, but for those of us who have to go to work everyday it's really not a viable option.  Moreover, the latest data supports children returning to school (with safety precautions) since their likelihood of sickness or even transmitting Covid-19 are relatively low."
11,154660333,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,13 Jul,"My concern is for the teachers. They're adults, not young children so their health risk is a different category than the kids'."
12,154660333,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,14 Jul,"Not only kids and teachers, but all other school staff, and every single person those kids come into contact with."
13,154660333,Brian Plummer,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jul,"Because you, as a adult, have a far greater capacity for online learning than a child. Have you ever seen a 6 year old try to learn online?"
14,154660333,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Jul,"I dunno. Kids seem to have a much quicker uptake on computer usage than I do sometimes. I still have concern for teachers who would be exposed and have a different risk level than the kids who could be carrying it with no ill-effects. I am well aware that parents can't go back to work if their kids are at home. IF ONLY EVERYBODY HAD WORN MASKS WHEN WE WERE ASKED TO DO THAT we might not be in the situation we are in now. I've been at home for 4 months now and it's not fun thinking it may be another several months before this gets under control enough to GRADUALLY re open things again. But then people rushed out to pack bars and casinos with no masks on and in general acted like they did in the ""before times"" which it probably won't be again until a long time from now. A little self-control would go a long way to helping get the worst of this over with but it seems some people just can't do that."
15,154660333,Brian Plummer,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jul,I agree with you. Im being somewhat of a devils advocate. I‚Äôm just saying that my 5 year old can‚Äôt effectively learn in a virtual environment. He tried it for the end of preschool and it was a disaster. If he gets distracted in a classroom he has to stay. If he gets distracted online he turns the app off and goes to his room. Added to that there is a significant population that doesn‚Äôt have reliable internet access.
16,154660333,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Jul,"Brian Plummer I agree with that. 5 year olds don't have the level of responsibility or self-control necessary to be online (or at any one thing for hours at a stretch, for that matter) all day. "
17,154660333,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Jul,"Even now when I'm in a store, someone will rush up and stand within 2 feet of me like as if I'm not there. Some of them aren't wearing masks. I have to move away from where I was first so that I don't have someone  breathing on me and I was there, not invisible, when they came rushing up. What IS it with people? Don't they understand at all how disease is spread? Don't they care that they might be hurting other people when they do things like that? I don't like being out and I'm finding it takes me about 1/3 longer now to do grocery shopping than it used to because of all the time I have to spend moving away from someone who has intruded on MY space where I was first, or who is walking the wrong way down an aisle with no mask on. It's not like things can just go back to how they used to be with so many uncooperative people around messing it up for everybody."
18,154660333,Colin Griffith,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Jul,"If we reopen schools as normal in the fall, kids are going to die. So are teachers. That's a fact. But everyone's talking about this as if the only two options are to send kids to school with the risks or cause thousands of parents to lose their jobs so that they can do homeschooling. We should be screaming, in every way possible, at our state government to provide the support that people will need to get through this without becoming homeless AND continue their kids' education."
19,154660333,Melisa Jaenisch,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jul,"Colin Griffith all good points. If schools reopen they will try to keep kids all in the same classroom (wearing masks). They will not switch classes or mix with other students. They will limit the number of teachers that come into that classroom. If someone tests positive then I do think that class and the teachers would need to quarantine. I think this would also mean that the parents/siblings of those students would also need to quarantine/go online for 2 weeks. Schools are also looking at staggering start times and having cohorts of students use different entrances, increasing cleaning, and hand washing during the day. Schools will need extra money to help cover all of these costs. One of the biggest challenges will be busing since the current guidelines are one student per seat. There are other countries that have been able to go back to school safely but they also waited until the number of infections was lower before they opened, have a robust contact tracing system, all citizens have access to free health care, and there is a more robust social system to help unemployed and sick employees. The US is not in a good spot right now...There are tons of reasons to open schools as well. I really worry about the children whose only meals came from school, only warm/clean place to go, need extra caring adults in their lives, families are going through homelessness, etc."

21,154660333,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Jul,"Ok, so that's about the children. What about the teachers? What addresses the issues that they will face in a classroom again?"
22,154660333,Melisa Jaenisch,‚Ä¢ Central Park,14 Jul,Kelly Taylor Lots of considerations. AAP safety precautions that should be adhered to and also depends on local rates of infection. Teachers need to be protected as well. Teachers that are at risk or have family at risk at home will need to be accommodated. Rates are climbing pretty quickly all over the US so schools will need to get creative with how to reopen schools online/in person this fall and everyone will need to be flexible and adherent to safety precautions.
23,154660333,Peter Higgins,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Jul,"Those of you who are taking the ""but I need to work"" angle here ... Are you going to be cool explaining your need for daycare to the families of dead or hospitalized students and teachers? It may sound like I'm being facetious, but that is a reality. Think about it."
24,154660333,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Jul,"Peter, I think everyone understands the need to work. IT's just that some types of work put people more at risk and that needs to be considered before a one-size-fits-all ""solution"" is implemented. There are so many variables that need to be accounted for and as yet I don't think officials have even started doing that."
25,154660333,Peter Higgins,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,14 Jul,"Kelly Taylor Oh, I know. My wife is a teacher and I have twins in high school, so we're right in the middle of it."
26,154660333,Catherine Wellwood,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,42w,"So, just some questions about potential challenges - I don't expect anyone to answer them - these are just some things I've wondered about in this very complex situation.  If a teacher tests positive, do the students in that classroom need to quarantine and stay home for a specific length of time?  Is there a pool of substitute teachers, since teachers who get sick may be on leave for weeks or months?  If support staff like cleaners get infected, how will that be handled?  Classrooms tend to be cluttered - how will the rooms be stripped down to make it possible to disinfect?  It sounds like recess would need to be highly structured with supervised activities since playground equipment can't be sanitized.  How will children's needs for physical activity and play be addressed?  I could go on, but I'll stop here!(edited)"
27,154660333,Wyatt Whorton,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,15 Jul,"Okay I can answer a few but not all as I don‚Äôt work on school site rather I work in the DPS central office. Recess as I last heard would not be occurring (at least on playground equipment) students would stay in classrooms for lunch and would not share supplies. Students would get health screening every day just as staff would. Passing periods would be staggered to reduce hallway clutter. Finally most importantly DPS is giving students and parents options to either A) attend school full time, B) attend part time, C) at home online learning!  Lmk if you have more!"
28,154660333,Wyatt Whorton,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,15 Jul,"I work at DPS there is no way to keep 97,000 students and 200+ schools in a controlled and effective online learning system for the foreseeable future. That doesn‚Äôt even include the infrastructure and operating costs. It is a public school systems yes but not just school. We provide counseling services. Free/reduced lunch and breakfast and a place for children to be whole their parents work."
29,154660333,Mindy Martin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,15 Jul,"Melisa Jaenisch Just reading comments‚Äînot engaging‚Äîbut I have been with kids and their ability to wear a mask in our lovely, but horrifically hot schoolrooms all day and not mess with them is another consideration‚Äîas an adult, I can‚Äôt wait to get the mask off and breathe‚Äînot sure how I‚Äôd do as a teacher anymore‚Äîmasks are necessary, they do impede verbal communication, kids need their routines, parents need a break and faculty, staff and administrators need all of our support‚ÄîI don‚Äôt have an answer but boy is my heart open to every question and obstacle we face‚Äî(one last thought‚Äîwe need the big tech companies to get computers to all kids‚Äîand give them an incentive‚Äîwho cares how much‚Äîthese are our children) kids shouldn‚Äôt be without or sharing laptops in 2020 America. To good health and wise decisions and a cooler August, Sept. and October."
30,154660333,Melisa Jaenisch,‚Ä¢ Central Park,15 Jul,"Mindy Martin All good points! There are so many challenges. There are also kids who don't have a place to set up a computer, nor internet, possibly not a home. Also there are children who need to look after their siblings. Maybe even parents who would sell the laptop...Lots of different strategies will need to be used no matter what/how we do school this fall. We are in this together and need to help each other along as much as we can."
31,154660333,Molly Halvy,‚Ä¢ Aurora,16 Jul,"A few people have posted questions about what will happen when a student or staff member tests positive for covid, and it‚Äôs crazy complicated. This news clip gives an overview: https://youtu.be/HcSAbV17kjs"
32,154660333,Melisa Jaenisch,‚Ä¢ Central Park,16 Jul,I love be flexible! I‚Äôm hoping for a hybrid model but I guess that is just as challenging...I did read somewhere that if they do a hybrid or full online model childcare for teachers/staff would be a priority....not sure what that would look like. If the infection rate/number of infections would get lower the risk would be much less. Thank you Molly and all the other teachers out there!

0,168232366,Keegan Perkins,‚Ä¢ Central Park,24w,"I used to work at a library, and people would leave items from sack lunches that they didn‚Äôt want. Will you offer the masks, or just put them in the lunches, because I‚Äôm thinking it might just end up being additional waste if they don‚Äôt want them. We had sack bags and applesauce containers all over the library. "
1,168232366,Tara Willis,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Nov,Happy to just offer them if that‚Äôs best. I offer the sack lunch in general and I suppose if they don‚Äôt want or need the sanitizer or masks I can keep them and given them to the next person. Certainly don‚Äôt want to add more waste. Thanks!

7,173990556,Taffi Bustos,‚Ä¢ Montbello,26 Jan,"I just edited it, his name is pon"
8,173990556,Angel Acosta,‚Ä¢ Montbello,29 Jan,No sightings yet.  There is a really good chance someone has him.  Have you tried going door to door? (with your mask on of course)
9,173990556,Taffi Bustos,‚Ä¢ Montbello,29 Jan,"Nothing!!üò≠üò≠ I'm sure someone does have him I've exhausted all suggestions, I've called every shelter everyday for the past 2 weeks, posted him, asked my neighbors..."
10,173990556,Angel Acosta,‚Ä¢ Montbello,29 Jan,Taffi Bustos Is he micro-chipped?
11,173990556,Taffi Bustos,‚Ä¢ Montbello,29 Jan,"No unfortunately, his appointment was the very next day he went missing.."
12,173990556,Taffi Bustos,‚Ä¢ Montbello,29 Jan,If someone has him it probably wouldn't have done much good anyway.
13,173990556,Angel Acosta,‚Ä¢ Montbello,29 Jan,I know but it does help if he ends up at the shelter.
14,173990556,Sabrina Crenshaw,‚Ä¢ First Creek Village,31 Jan,Is this her?

18,173990556,Angel Acosta,‚Ä¢ Montbello,31 Jan,but keep in mind those items could have been put on  by another human.
19,173990556,Taffi Bustos,‚Ä¢ Montbello,31 Jan,I did think about that!  So I did reach out to this person
20,173990556,Angel Acosta,‚Ä¢ Montbello,31 Jan,oh good!ü§û

1,150423539,Becky Robinson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 Jun,Thank you for organizing! I will try to join and will keep an eye out for future demonstrations in the neighborhood if I can‚Äôt get there tonight
2,150423539,Jake Arias,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,3 Jun,Thank you so much for this!! It's great that parents are providing a safe place to show their support with their children. There have been many unsupervised children downtown causing mayhem during these and sadly this detrimental to the cause. I encourage parents to please be aware of where your children are during these protests. I was working in aid stations all weekend and there were plenty of teenagers trying to seek refuge after damaging police cars or starting fires. These acts only reflect poorly on the organizers that are trying to demonstrate peacefully. Thank you!!
3,150423539,Alicia Sitzmann,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,3 Jun,Great idea to teach kids a peaceful way to stand up for what is right.

3,152664188,Dorothy Todd,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,24 Jun,"Thanks Carlos, I am on the lookout for a friend who is working full time, so I'm helping with the leg-work.  I don't know what type of printer he has. Shipping and supply is weird lately, grocery stores are out of some items that I would never anticipate.  I looked for tapioca (in a box to make at home).  They haven't had it for several weeks!  Tapioca?!?  I don't think there has been a run on it!!! Strange times!"
4,152664188,Jane Hile,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Jun,What %?
5,152664188,Jane Hile,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Jun,Dollar tree has rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) at 50%. Most other places like drugstores sell it at 70% and Walmart is the only place I have found that carries 90%.
6,152664188,Dorothy Todd,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,25 Jun,Thanks! I'll see who has some in stock. And I'll see what % is needed.
7,152664188,Jane Hile,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,26 Jun,If they need 90% you can order online from Walmart and they'll ship.
8,152664188,Jeremy Hutt,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,26 Jun,I ordered some 70% on Amazon. Didn't seem to be a problem...

17,140896902,Mary M Anderson,‚Ä¢ Lyn Knoll,18 Mar 20,Yes they are a chain.but their mission statement and their code of ethics stands out to me. You or I even if we weren't homeless can go in and ask for a bowl of soup..

0,144032329,Cristy Davis,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,9 Apr 20,"I think very large gatherings will be out for a long time. I imagine some non essential businesses opening first and places like dental offices and other medical services so that people can easily get preventive and routine care again. I wonder if restaurants might re open for dining with fewer tables or a certain maximum capacity. I hope everyone remains more diligent about hand washing and not going out when sick, which frankly has always been ideal. On a personal level I hope it feels okay to have a few friends come over in the near future, but maybe adhere to a 10 person limit on any gathering for a while."
1,144032329,Stephen Murphy,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,9 Apr 20,"this also assumes that the only people who have been infected have been tested. In reality I would guess we are at least at 10x that rate of infection, if not even higher. "

He also said that due to the shortage of tests only the acute patients will be tested when they come in to the hospital.
5,144032329,Marcia Kayhanfar,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,9 Apr 20,I also know people who were told by a dr that they had it but were not high risk enough to us a test on

4,147310972,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,7 May 20,"I've noticed a very distinct increase in Colfax Avenue ""traffic"" lately, too. SO many more people out and about, so many more cars slowly trolling and turning onto side streets to get swarmed by what appear to be drug dealers and hookers. I don't know why the police continue to ignore this. What crimes are they too busy pursuing that are more dangerous than what's going on around here?"

I am involved with a charity that provides brown bag lunches, essentials from hotels, clothes (especially jackets and sweaters) and suitcases. I will buy them for a minimal cost but can give you a donation receipt for taxes of actual used value. We had changed our Christmas Eve distribution to March bc many of our volunteers were not available.  We had to postpone to end of March and it had to be postponed until October. One of our volunteers have room to store in their basement. I have collected and purchased suitcases at ARC and Goodwill and bought from Next Door. I can pick them up as early as tomorrow or if anyone else has anything else to donate I can pick up anytime b4 October. Suitcases and backpacks are the 1st thing homeless want and are usually given away in the 1st 10 minutes they arrive. Bc different volunteers arriving at different times, the bags are spread out in the 4 or 5 hours we are there. Plus it is so helpful we can pack the suitcases with donations so easier for volunteers to bring instead of in garbage bags that rip!"

1,174430567,Mariee Santistevan,‚Ä¢ Sunnyside,23 Jan,QUESTION: What's the difference between TANF & the diversion program?
2,174430567,Brett Schager,‚Ä¢ Wyco Park,24 Jan,"Good question.  Diversion is a one-time payment for someone who does not qualify for TANF  It makes you ineligible for TANF for a year because it's meant to prevent you from needing TANF later on.  I do not do eligibility, so I can't tell you what the income guidelines are, but TANF and Diversion are generally for anyone low-income with a child under 18 in the household. If you are over income for TANF, you may be eligible for Diversion, which in my experience usually covers rent costs and overdue bills.  We also have special grants related to the pandemic and our workforce services."
0,145794426,Chuck H L.,‚Ä¢ North Aurora/Fitzsimons,24 Apr 20,"I recently visited that Walmart- I could not believe how many people were inside and in parking lot. I actually thought to myself- did they remove the stay at home orders? Well I wear my N 95 and tons of gloves and hand sanitizer. Well I go in and it's packed. Grabbed some very much needed Essentials and took my stuff to register. Cashier was in training and no mask or gloves. As I was paying some older female employee was walking around telling customers "" keep you're distance if you wanna live"" and she had no problem anyone out loud. So sad for the deceased and the families. Walmart in Stapleton has people  monitoring how many people walk in and making sure they keep the distance. One thing that is concerning is that the bottle of some sort of cleaner they provide does not even contain alcohol. I took the time to read it. So I just used my hand sanitizer to clean everything in my basket and the basket. Walmart needs to provide more cleaning supplies."

Let the tomatoes dry between watering, fertilize the soil well with compost, bone meal, calcium and garden lime (to prevent blossom rot), and feed the plant once every two weeks with a high nitrogen based plant food. YouTube has tons of videos on how to prune them for best result. Water them without getting the leaves wet to prevent mildew.

12,148036203,Rosemary L.,‚Ä¢ Coventry,15 May,I grew hops a few years ago.  Think they were ‚ÄúGolden hops‚Äù. They took over the ground and fence behind them.  And are ridiculously hard to get rid of.  Turns out they were not the right kind of hops for beer.  Who‚Äôknew?  So check this out and you will probably have to order by mail from a specialty grower.   Good luck!  Love you on 9‚ù£Ô∏è
13,148036203,"Steve Staeger, 9NEWS",,16 May,"Thanks, Rosemary L.!"
14,148036203,Connie Polcyn,‚Ä¢ Park Rise,16 May,Steve if you like tomatoes try husky cherry tomatoes. They are bigger than regular tomatoes and grow really good in a large pot. They grow so good I've had to pick daily they are so sweet & juicy. If you can't eat all at once rinse off dry and put in a Ziploc bag and freeze. You can use for salsa stew spaghetti sauce etc....
15,148036203,Connie Polcyn,‚Ä¢ Park Rise,16 May,Ive stuck a basil plant or jalapeno in the dirt I try and use all the space I have...good luck and enjoy...üêûüêúüòÄüêùüêù
16,148036203,Kammy Alford,‚Ä¢ City Park West,16 May,"Basil grows great in pots!  I can eat caprese salad all summer long, but only with heirloom tomatoes.  If anyone is selling any later in the season, I am in!!!"

18,148036203,Susan B.,‚Ä¢ Village at Harmony Park,17 May,Try a trellis pot the link is to wayfair they have some nice ones. 
19,148036203,Ms H.,‚Ä¢ Village East,51w,"I bring basil in , over winter, replant in garden for 2nd summer. Trim and eat before it flowers & goes to seed. "
20,148036203,Sonya Stelter,‚Ä¢ Club Crest,17 May,"Steve, I am not sure if they are still doing it but AC Golden Brewing (part of MolsonCoors) gives rhizomes away for residents to grow and return the hops to be used in the Colorado Native brews. I believe it's to late this year to request one but maybe for next year if you are interested."
21,148036203,Kristin Marshall,‚Ä¢ West Colfax,18 May,Make sure whatevee vessel you plant them in has adequate draining. I made this mistake with some indoor veggies I tried to grow and they never progressed beyond seedlings.

0,150451542,Linda Stark,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,48w,Walmart has been threatened. The head management has ordered all  stores boarded..Walmart and Target both. Its nationwide.... it's what I heard earlier today(edited)
1,150451542,Sadie Martin,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,3 Jun,Thank you! I feel bad for the people who shop there with their low prices...
2,150451542,Linda Stark,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 Jun,Sadie Martin I sent you a private message as well
3,150451542,Rose Berg,‚Ä¢ Aurora,3 Jun,Like closed boarded up?
4,150451542,Greg Arends,‚Ä¢ Central Park,3 Jun,No just the windows are covered it's still open and busy
5,150451542,Linda Stark,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 Jun,They are boarded up but apparently will remain open until 8:30 p.m. here in Denver personally I don't think that is the atmosphere I want to go shopping in at Walmart
6,150451542,Jeff Winchester,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,3 Jun,Probably don‚Äôt want to be looted.
7,150451542,Mike N.,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,4 Jun,"It's their new ""employe motivation program"". Block out the sunlight to disconnect from the outside world. That way they don't notice how long they work without breaks."

0,136311197,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,1y,We have an immediate need for housing... so let‚Äôs let the horse out of the barn in every neighborhood in Denver. Like we created the housing crisis. No. And you want us to pay your penance? Too broad and free range in application. Think harder.(edited)
1,136311197,Stacie Knapp,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,7 Feb 20,Oh no.
2,136311197,Jim P.,‚Ä¢ Hutchinson Hills Willow Point,7 Feb 20,NO ! Be sure to let these misguided public servants that we are their ticket to the government teat. And we can and will vote to end their gravy train. We will and can vote as a block.
3,136311197,Ryk M.,‚Ä¢ Hampden,7 Feb 20,"A lot of people think the changes are reasonable, so you can bet that the populace will definitely not ""vote as a block""."
4,136311197,Shelby G.,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park,7 Feb 20,Thanks for sharing! I found this article extremely informative. I don't see a problem with allowing more unrelated people to live together. Better than living on the streets. Y'all must really hate poor people if you're opposed to this.
5,136311197,Mary Ellen Silcott,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,7 Feb 20,No one has said they hate poor people.  Let's please discuss this issue without being snarky.
6,136311197,Noel P.,‚Ä¢ Technology Way,7 Feb 20,"It's a good idea, within reason. "
7,136311197,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,1y,"I agree the idea should not be shut down, just better defined so it is not used by others out of the context and applied in a free range fashion.(edited)"
8,136311197,Christopher P.,‚Ä¢ Harvey Park,7 Feb 20,They don't enforce these laws now!   The only thing this  will do is promote more people living in single family residences and allowing even more cars to a house. There is a house not far from me that I literally counted 11 vehicles parked in front of it.  On what used to be the lawn etc...   This is ridiculous and the powers that are suggesting this is a good idea are also ridiculous...  It is not an either or scenario for those who say better than people living on the streets.  Most of those people are not on teh streets because of these rules!
9,136311197,Rex M.,‚Ä¢ Fort Logan,7 Feb 20,I believe allowing people to solve their own problems with them cooperating is the best option and interfering with it should not be done.
10,136311197,Beth B.,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,7 Feb 20,"I agree for the most part, except mental illness, addiction (self medicating), handicaps, domestic abuse (not always just physical) have to be accounted for. Sone people are not capable mentally to get it together others need that little boost or resources. Some need to feel someone cares for motivation. Some are plain embarrassed. People need people. But also people need to take responsibility. Compassion and common sense are two great abilities. The world is not and will never be black and white. Embrace & learn to love the complexity of the gray area inbetween. Not pointing fingers at you just making a statement."
11,136311197,Cindy Engel,‚Ä¢ Southmoor Park East,1y,Preliminary information from a community HOA meeting is that the recommendation will be up to 8 unrelated people per 1600 square foot property and for each additional 200 square feet 1 unrelated person is allowed.  Seems like a lot of cars...and potential people - each one can have related people in the home too?  So a 2000 square foot home can have up to 10 unrelated people.  Not saying that this shouldn't be looked at just make it reasonable and then enforce it.(edited)
12,136311197,Maria Draco,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,1y,Lots of open space in Kansas.(edited)
13,136311197,Beth B.,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,7 Feb 20,Im from there.... runaway! Runaway!
14,136311197,Aaron Williams,‚Ä¢ Lowry,1y,Wrong answer to the problem. There‚Äôs room at your mom‚Äôs house.‚Äôlive with her.(edited)
15,136311197,Jacob F.,‚Ä¢ Marston,7 Feb 20,Which city council members and donors will be making big money off of this? Rent a house for $2000 to 1 family or to 10 people for $1000 each. The house next to me is already falling apart as a rental.... I'm sure the landlord would take full advantage of this.
16,136311197,Diane Duncanson,‚Ä¢ Marston,7 Feb 20,I have reviewed the information for this proposal and can find nothing in it to benefit the citizens of Denver. Aside from the obvious parking issues which could potentially be 16 more vehicles parked on the streets. All this does is allow non Denver residents that own property in Denver to get more in rent and create ghettos. Please contact your Councilperson and let them know you oppose this ordinance change.
17,136311197,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,7 Feb 20,This goes WAY beyond parking.

19,136311197,Ryk M.,‚Ä¢ Hampden,7 Feb 20,Here's another article that I thought was pretty informative. https://denverite.com/2020/02/06/do-you-know-denvers-rules-about-living-together-heres-what-some-people-want-to-change-about-them/
20,136311197,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,7 Feb 20,"i have been following this issue closely for months; restrictions on unrelated cohabitants are just one aspect out of several to the group living amendment; before jumping to conclusions, i suggest reading through the page linked in the OP ‚Äî it will help you understand the reasoning and be more realistic about the impacts"
21,136311197,Dorothy N.,‚Ä¢ Baker,18 Feb 20,"‚ÄúWe are modernizing a very outdated code with an eye toward equity,‚Äù said Andrew Webb, the city planner who has managed the project on zoning for group living. ‚ÄúWe certainly think it‚Äôs very important to bring the code up to speed with the way people living together has evolved.‚Äù"
22,136311197,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,7 Feb 20,"That‚Äôs my concern. How it reads right now is one thing. How it works, is monitored and controlled in a wide spectrum of potential applications  is  my concern. None of this is addressed."
23,136311197,Debra Buchanan,‚Ä¢ Indian Creek,25 Feb 20,Or leave troubled neighbors with no way to resolve violations.
24,136311197,Priscilla T.,‚Ä¢ Mar Lee,7 Feb 20,Why more housing we got enough people here. Why not invest your little project into something more useful like trying to save our planet or like preserve land and sanctuaries. Climate change does exist people. Our environment is on the bridge of dying.
25,136311197,Randy K.,‚Ä¢ Capitol Hill NW,7 Feb 20,"You're comparing apples to oranges!  Of course the environment matters, but if you think affordable housing is not important, take a look outside your window today and try to imagine that it's you that has to sleep outside in this storm!"
26,136311197,Gayle G.,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek East,7 Feb 20,"If it's similar to Section 8 Housing rules & regs, what will the maximum number of occupant limits be in one residence?  Who will be responsible for overseeing the maximum number doesn't end up being more that number + 2, 3, 4, 5, or more?  We know of two Section 8 housing locations where the occupants are supposed to be a woman and her children. Grandma, great grandmoms, boyfriend and a host of others bunk under the same roof.  New s never watered (replaced a multitude of times), window coverings trashed, broken windows, dog excrement all over, and the insides look squalid.  Just saying.  A residence like this could be your next door neighbor."
27,136311197,Joyce R.,‚Ä¢ University Park,18 Feb 20,So true. There are homes rented to groups of students around DU and they are always a mess.
28,136311197,Ken S.,‚Ä¢ Whittier,7 Feb 20,"Steve H Please read what definition of Gerrymandering is. Hint it is a political term Not a zoning term. I believe in capitalism and made $ building moderate and low income housing in Denver for 20 years. The current free market in real estate and higher end houseing market left to its own has contributed to many but not all of the problems. The United States has not had a completely free market in over 150 years. Read the history of the Erie Canal which could never have been built without government subsidies. That Canal provide a major boost in the economy during that period while the country was in a recession with grain and other agricultural products flowing to Eastern cities and industrial products going west. Many of the railroads the same and in particular the East West Continental Railroads were highly lsubsidized. I completely agree that these efforts are a drop in the proverbial bucket for very low income and homeless which is a far more complex problem that housing. Where would young teachers, restaurant and grocery workers, other service and factory and warehouse workers live in the future. Answer will be building further East, North into prime farmland for example Weld County. Weld  is the largest producer and of Agricultural products in Colorado and more than any in the West until the large Agricultural Valleys in Southern California. South also to Colorado Springs. This is highly iinefficiencty spreading out chewing up more land and resources. Maybe you have your little slice of heaven. I do but I am 71 and I care about my kids and grandchildren in Denver where my daughter who has a College degree and her husband a Community College Business degree. They struggle living in a two bedroom apartment with kids. They will move in with me and I will move into my basement until I build my garage and 700 square ft living space. I care about how my grandchildren and there working class peers are educated etc. I have a law degree and a. Master's degree. Athletic ability paid for most of my education and growing up in two schools systems one ranked #2 in New York State and the other somewhere in the top 8 in Illinois."
29,136311197,STEVE HARLEY,‚Ä¢ Baker,7 Feb 20,"Ken Strohson i think you meant to address Samuel Hargraves; but yeah, a lot of ranting here"
30,136311197,Kristi Valdez,‚Ä¢ Cole,7 Feb 20,I‚Äôm assuming this new revised plan will not be implemented in single family neighborhoods but pushed into the new gentrified neighborhoods where a large part of the homes were bought to flip rather than live in and now these landlords are more than willing to let as many strangers they can get into their houses to make a profit. If these houses are not YOUR neighbors than it sounds like a great idea. I‚Äôm speaking as a home owner who has already went through this... It will never end well!
31,136311197,Gaar Potter,‚Ä¢ Happy Canyon,7 Feb 20,"Um Kristi, this new revised plan is aimed EXACTLY at single family neighborhoods and their zoning. Next time you vote, find out who hearts this and don't vote for them.  That might include your present rep.....we'll see. So your assumption is wrong."

9,145788826,Cookie Hayze,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,23 Apr 20,Why did it take so long for the CDC to warn us? They knew when these ppl got sick honestly I'm pissed! All we really hear on the news is about DENVER we have to go digging for info or listen to town halls about our city and counties!

14,145788826,Chauncey Liszcz,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,24 Apr 20,Yes I saw on the news this morning that three people from that Walmart died. the news said that anybody that's been in that Walmart recently need to quarantine themselves for 2 weeks!! anybody if y'all been at that Walmart I don't care if you're not showing symptoms it's going to take 2 weeks before you start showing symptoms please quarantine yourself! There are programs out there that will help you financially and plenty of ways for you to get supplies without leaving your house. I'm begging you for the safety of our children safety of me and my family to say a few of my friends and family to see if two of your friends are family and your children you got to quarantine yourself if you been at Walmart recently! there should be thousands of people quarantine themselves right now because thousands of people have been to that Walmart recently!!!!
15,145788826,Chauncey Liszcz,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,24 Apr 20,Wow text-to-speech really f***** that up lol. I'm sure you guys got the just of it.

20,145788826,Gena Allen,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,24 Apr 20,The lady that passed was Sandy. She was the cashier with the silver hair who wore an oxygen tube. Her husband also died but he didn't work there. The security man was the very friendly black man. Also 9 employees tested positive. I finally decided to venture out for the first time since this crap started and where do I go? You guessed it....Walmart on the day before they shut it down. I now have to quarantine for 14 days because I'm an old lady with COPD. This sucks. I feel bad for the people who passed but I'm angry at Walmart.
21,145788826,Alyssa Maloney,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,24 Apr 20,"From a nurse friend, you don't have to quarantine for 14 days unless you are showing signs or symptoms.  Just continue to wear a mask, wash hands, and go out only when absolutely needed."
22,145788826,Diane Porras,‚Ä¢ Apache Mesa,24 Apr 20,"It depends on the person.... and as I have health issues, I will quarantine just to be safe."

29,145788826,Craig Snapp,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,26 Apr 20,Oh god I hope with new managers and a tight restriction on health rules and the health department observing they adhere to everything!  I did some research and this is not an isolated incident with walmart and the corona virus.  Other walmarts have had deaths and found to have lack guidelines!  I would say boycott them for now in honor of those lost and let them feel the brunt of this needless loss of life and infected!!

I used to be a dog walker in San Francisco and occasionally a dog would get into homeless people‚Äôs feces that had pot or other drug remnants in it and would cause strange sickly behavior in the dog.

My husband went there later in the afternoon to pick up his grill and they were closing the location, which seemed bizarre for a weekend afternoon.  Figured it was either because multiple people had been hit by purse/wallet snatchers, or they were closing early because of fear of looting with protests.  Thank you for posting and I'm sorry that happened.  I did warn him and our friend that was assisting to watch their wallets, and not to get distracted by anyone.(edited)"

0,154454160,Lynda Armijo,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,10 Jul,Call Police and go in Target and have them make an announcement that the police has been called regarding a dog left in whatever make and model car it is.  I am so sad that people are so stupid and inconsiderate.
1,154454160,Carol Richardson,‚Ä¢ Apache Mesa,10 Jul,It is against the law to leave an animal in a hot car. Hope that the dog is ok.
2,154454160,Douglas Wells,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,11 Jul,What law ? Laws don't mean squat.
3,154454160,Jessica Meadows,‚Ä¢ Norfolk Glenn,13 Jul,"Yes , yes there is"
4,154454160,Kelsey Comeau,‚Ä¢ Central Park,43w,"Always call the authorities first. Try the store and see if they can call for the owner. If no one shows and the dog is visibly distressed and in danger, break the window. CO law was passed protecting anyone for breaking the window of a vehicle to save a child or pet in danger. "
5,154454160,Amy Dahms,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,10 Jul,Can‚Äôt you break the windows for that?

12,154454160,Cecilia Romero,‚Ä¢ Chambers Heights,10 Jul,Was the dog okay??
13,154454160,Diane Porras,‚Ä¢ Apache Mesa,10 Jul,They most likely will have gotten an animal cruelty charge and a court summons

17,154454160,Janet Pethan,‚Ä¢ Chambers Heights,10 Jul,the humane society will react to these abused pets and I know the police will in some cities!
18,154454160,Melanie Driscoll,‚Ä¢ Central Park,10 Jul,Colorado is one of 8 states that has a Good Samaritan law that allows any person to break a car window to save a pet or person. I would not hesitate if a pet or child was in danger.
19,154454160,Jen Brunz,‚Ä¢ Lyn Knoll,10 Jul,Are you sure the car wasn‚Äôt on with the AC????
20,154454160,Jen Brunz,‚Ä¢ Lyn Knoll,43w,My car turns on with a remote start and is temp controlled when started with remote. And this Subaru looks like it‚Äôs newer. So pretty sure it doesn‚Äôt need to be fancy with a ‚Äúdog mode‚Äù. Just saying.(edited)
21,154454160,EJ Vill,‚Ä¢ Central Park,11 Jul,"If you ever see a dog in a Tesla be sure to look at the screen inside the car. The screen will have a message in large bold print alerting bystanders what the temperature is inside the vehicle if the owner has left the vehicle in ‚Äúdog mode‚Äù.  Occasionally I will leave my dog in the car for just a few minutes on a very hot day to run in and pick up food or coffee at a restaurant. In an electric vehicle you can leave climate control on when vehicle is off. Setting car to dog mode when you leave the car will keep the AC on and keep temperature below 70 degrees and will display the current temperature on the center screen in very large print easily seen from outside the vehicle. If you don‚Äôt see this, then you should be concerned."
22,154454160,Karena Carlson,‚Ä¢ Highland Park East,11 Jul,"Good to know, but most cars don't automatically protect animals"
23,154454160,EJ Vill,‚Ä¢ Central Park,11 Jul,"Karena Carlson well Karen, that was the point of the post, to inform people who may not know this when seeing a dog in a Tesla since most cars don‚Äôt automatically protect animals. Thanks for stopping by.."
24,154454160,Karena Carlson,‚Ä¢ Highland Park East,11 Jul,Next time call animal control immediately.  They will respond quickly and owners will be cited.  You will save lives if you call and wait for animal control
25,154454160,Karena Carlson,‚Ä¢ Highland Park East,11 Jul,Not everyone has a luxury vehicle programmed to protect the animals inside.  In this heat it is better to be safe .
26,154454160,Rian Innes,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,11 Jul,"Not to be a Debby downer, but to everyone commenting ‚Äúbreak the window!!!‚Äù The rear driver side window is clearly down in the second pic. Breaking the window wouldn‚Äôt do anything at all, reach in, open the door, and give the dog cold water while waiting for the police, that‚Äôd probably be the best course of actions"
27,154454160,Mary Leone,‚Ä¢ Sunridge,43w,What?  Address the concern rather than hang the driver? This is an amazing concept!

3,171938107,Booker Williamson,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,27 Dec,I have not. Would you like to help me?
4,171938107,Christa Osman,‚Ä¢ Central Park,27 Dec,Well I'm not well versed on all of the sites available. You'd need to post more info on PawBoost for sure.
5,171938107,Andrea Bebee,‚Ä¢ Central Park,28 Dec,Craigslist community pets definitely. Are you on Facebook? Central Park lost pets group.
6,171938107,Tatiana Masterson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,27 Dec,"So sorry you are going through this. Is your dog microchipped? Male or female? Age? Was the dog wearing a colar? Any tags? Have you filed a police report for the car and the dog? Have you called all local animal shelters? These are very important in order to have a bigger chance to recoup the dog. Please let us know as we can also be in the lookout for these details, which should also be on the Pawboost post and any flyers you print and post around the neighborhood."
7,171938107,Booker Williamson,‚Ä¢ Hoffman Heights,27 Dec,"1.5 male, not microchiped, wearing purple kong collar, no tag. "
8,171938107,Tatiana Masterson,‚Ä¢ Central Park,27 Dec,"Thanks. Please make sure they keep a photo of your dog with call name. And keep checking with the shelter. But check with other shelters as well, it does not mean he can end up with the closest one. Making posters with your contact info and stapling/taping them to poles (check city regulations) is also very effective. I believe you can make a poster on PawBoost. Include all the info you told me, even offer a reward (very effective). But please include his name so people who see him can call him and he can feel more comfortable answering. If any health conditions, also list. It will lower interest on someone keeping him. Let me know if I can help with any other advice. I hope you find him."

4,170706186,Julia Marie,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,13 Dec,"Thank you for mentioning this! Is it the same for prime grocery delivery? We are able to add a tip before we order over Amazon, would this be in addition to that?"

8,170706186,Laurie S.,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,13 Dec,You all deserve nice tips!!
9,170706186,Shannon Haines,‚Ä¢ Skyland,13 Dec,"Thank you for mentioning this Mimi. I am relying on Instacart also for my only income and I'm grateful for the work and tips. People do need to know it's hard work, and there are expenses for us too (vehicle expenses, gas, maintenance). Consider the following when tipping also.. are you in an apartment building where there is limited parking and we will have to bring your groceries up an elevator and down a long hallway? That's more time and physically can be challenging. I just hope people recognize that or offer to meet at the door to assist if your not going to tip or don't have it to tip. It really is a premium service to have people grocery shop for you and deliver it. If the industry standard for serving in restaurants is 20% shouldn't shopping and delivery services be in that ballpark? Instacart default on the tip used to be 5%. I don't know if it's changed. I think it's a good thing to tip according to the service also. If your shopper provides better level of service or on the flip side is rude unresponsive takes too long delivering take those factors into consideration also. "
10,170706186,Shannon Haines,‚Ä¢ Skyland,13 Dec,... days easier! I prematurely posted before I was done with my thought üí≠ stay safe and healthy everyone.

12,170706186,Maggie W.,‚Ä¢ Hale,13 Dec,It's a huge privilege to stay home and utilize these services. Your shopper is taking the risk so that you don't have to. It's sad to think there are people who don't tip at all!
13,170706186,Sandra Strong,‚Ä¢ Aurora,14 Dec,I do tip Instacart drivers.  But what about when you open your bags and items are missing?  I know they find those items in their car. Why not bring us our items. Happened several times to me.
14,170706186,Amanda M.,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,17 Dec,Once the delivery is completed they can no longer contact you or see your address.
15,170706186,Lisa Manzanares,‚Ä¢ Montbello,21w,This is helpful information as I don‚Äôt ever used this service but would not know to tip and now I do if I ever start using it. Thank you!(edited)
16,170706186,Serena Ku,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,14 Dec,"Happy to tip accordingly, when all my groceries are present and in acceptable condition.  I have received soggy grocery bags full of wet food because a bottle or eggs broke."
17,170706186,Shannon Haines,‚Ä¢ Skyland,15 Dec,"That is not acceptable. You pay for usable groceries. When something like this happens, and unfortunately it does.. sometimes we drop things or inadvertently something gets crushed. If I know about it, I will let the customer know and suggest they contact Instacart to request a refund of any damaged items. Hopefully that‚Äôs what u did. If they dropped the stuff at the door damaged and didn‚Äôt tell you about it- because how would u not know about a wet bag of eggs :) maybe mention that. It‚Äôs good feedback for us also to know about your experience too! Thanks."
18,170706186,TL Hublou,‚Ä¢ Aurora,15 Dec,"Thanks for posting. I'm having everything delivered right now. I had groceries delivered from Walmart the other day by a young woman that worked for Door Dash. I felt bad because I had a couple heavy items delivered. I wish I would have noticed she was bringing stuff to the door right away, I have a wagon that folds up that I use to carry stuff from my vehicle to the house back when I could shop. I would have let her use it to. When I mentioned it she said she would like to get one herself. She told me about the small amount she gets paid by Door Dash and how a lot of people don't tip. She said she did an order the day before mine and had to carry 4-24 packs of soda up to the 3rd floor of a building and she didn't get any tip on that order. "
19,170706186,Nancy Sloane,‚Ä¢ Lowry,15 Dec,"I'm glad you brought up this topic. I've never been sure what to do when my groceries are delivered. I went ahead and tipped, anyway, wondering if I'd already ""tipped"" the person by way of charges tacked on to my order. I'm so appreciative of anyone who helps me out, especially since I'm stuck at home with this quarantine! I've always been a good tipper, but now, realizing how little you're paid, I'll pay extra attention to what I give to my shopper/delivery person."
20,170706186,Norah Lovato,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,21w,"I am so sorry Mimi.  This is terrible. These folks are driving to/from the grocery store, shopping for you in a pandemic & delivering the food to your front door after possibly carrying your groceries down the street & up flights of stairs and people don‚Äôt tip??? "
21,170706186,Shannon Haines,‚Ä¢ Skyland,15 Dec,"Well said. Perhaps a softer approach to convey the message, üòã but I‚Äôm learning and liking how direct people seem to be in Colorado. You are right tho."
22,170706186,Julia Thornton,‚Ä¢ Quebec Parkway,15 Dec,You can only give what you have I'm 2 miles from store and give 3dollars which I can't afford but I give and not to Wal-Mart I give to driver.
23,170706186,Lisa Kelekolio,‚Ä¢ Cole,15 Dec,"I always tip well, hopefully you ªll get one of mine!"
24,170706186,Rachel Makinen,‚Ä¢ Cherry Creek North,16 Dec,"It's really sad that the delivery companies are so cheap and treating their employees like crap. Yes it's imperative to tip, but a good business should be paying their employees a sustainable wage, even if they are part-time or contract workers. These delivery companies are making a fortune right now and it's disgusting that they're paying the employees so poorly. I always over tip and those who can afford to do so, should.  But also please keep in mind that some people don't have other options and they are also perhaps in a compromise position and/or strapped for cash because of covid;  perhaps they are out of work,b lost their car or jobs or are in poor health, etc."
25,170706186,Charlene/Joseph Medina,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,16 Dec,Instacart calculates a delivery charge plus tips and another charge equal to tip charge! I find that that is all I can afford most times! I have started picking up my groceries after ordering online and I believe in tipping but find myself without cash for a tip! I will try to add some extra to the tip when I use Instacart!
26,170706186,Ann Burke,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,16 Dec,"Mimi Kyles, start your own business on the side! We will support you!"
27,170706186,Michelle H.,‚Ä¢ Cheesman Park,16 Dec,"Telmahury Robledo However, you‚Äôre letting someone take on the Covid risk that you wish to avoid, so tipping them generously is the least you can do."

9,154402435,Rebekah Lynn,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,11 Jul,Yes they have been having meetings about a proposed retail center to be added to the land that is south of GVR blvd & east of Memphis. I don't think they have fully secured a retailer yet but fingers crossed that they are in talks with Costco. Costco has recently purchased land near the airport for a distribution center so it could be a good indicator that they would add a warehouse location nearby. Here is more info about the proposed retail center from a meeting a few months ago.
10,154402435,Marc Duflos,‚Ä¢ Central Park,11 Jul,That's exciting! I'd love a Costco closeby.
11,154402435,Gail Schultz,‚Ä¢ Central Park,11 Jul,There goes my savings !
12,154402435,April Velasco,‚Ä¢ Montbello,11 Jul,Is there somewhere we could sign a petition to get a Costco? That would be amazing!

0,152107946,Shan Campbell,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Jun,Here you go! 
1,152107946,LaKia Thomas,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,18 Jun,Thank you!
2,152107946,Shan Campbell,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Jun,So welcome.
3,152107946,Allison E.,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,18 Jun,I have never had a pleasant experience in there! Employees are surly and downright rude most of the time.  I absolutely dread going in there.
4,152107946,Jeanine Ransom,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,18 Jun,"I‚Äôm so sorry-there‚Äôs no reason for you to be treated like that, especially since we pay their salaries üòÇ. I‚Äôm glad you have info to take the complaint higher-sounds like an excellent and much needed plan!"
5,152107946,Liz LaRue,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,19 Jun,We do not pay their salaries...
6,152107946,Simone Garcia,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,18 Jun,üòü disheartened to hear
7,152107946,Emma lewis,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,19 Jun,"It use to be the best PO around, but since the old guard retired, in my experience, in my experience they haven‚Äôt held that same standard. I‚Äôve also lived in the area for 30 years also."
8,152107946,Shanta Harrison-Sullivan,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,19 Jun,"Emma, you are exactly right. That never would‚Äôve happened if Carl had still been there. I knew that the level of service was going to decline when he retired."
9,152107946,Anne Culver,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,19 Jun,The Manager should be held accountable!!
10,152107946,Celine Garrett,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,19 Jun,The USPS is a conundrum as to how it is funded.  I was in advertising sales for years and used to call on them.  They are not federal workers but part of federal government oversight.  It‚Äôs the strangest organization. They can have Fed. Holidays but still are not federal employees.  The PostMaster is the contact for all things in compliance.
11,152107946,Julie Spaeth,‚Ä¢ Historic Montclair,19 Jun,The post office on 11th avenue by Lowry is just as bad‚Äî-rude staff that just don‚Äôt care
12,152107946,stephanie Duce,‚Ä¢ Central Park,20 Jun,I‚Äôve never experienced rude staff there
13,152107946,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,26 Jun,"There is really no excuse fore rudeness in a CS position but it could be the environment they work in. I have a friend that works there, and I hadn‚Äôt seen her at church for a long time she said they were even making her work on Sundays she is a carrier. She really can‚Äôt wait to retirement. It could possibly be a hostile environment."
14,152107946,Susan Cardasis,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,19 Jun,I live 4 blocks from 11th Avenue post office. And never use it b/c it‚Äôs so poorly run and always has lines. I prefer to drive to Northfield where I find the staff is very friendly and efficient. I also NEVER have mailproblems there.
15,152107946,Shanta Harrison-Sullivan,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Jun,"Susan, are you talking about the Commerce City location....the main PO?"
16,152107946,Susan Cardasis,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,22 Jun,"Yes, over on 53rd."
17,152107946,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,19 Jun,Call the main postal office or send an e-mail I use to have number but I‚Äôm sure 311 can refer you. I sent my taxes certified mail one tome and on the tracking it had been sitting at one location  and they kept helping me until it was located but I started with an e-mail.
18,152107946,Shari Foreman,‚Ä¢ Central Park,19 Jun,"Wow, I recently started going there. The same man has been very polite to me each time.  I hope I don‚Äôt have to ever deal with her. I‚Äôm sorry you experienced that. But yes, go above her."
19,152107946,Mark Brown,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,20 Jun,The post office at 33rd and Hudson is usually not very busy and the staff are pleasant.
20,152107946,Michael Campo,‚Ä¢ Central Park,20 Jun,"I stopped going there.  I went three times and every time one of their employee has been rude.  One time, they told me they did not have stamps very rudely.   I went to King Sooopers and got stamps.  This office needs to be defunded."
21,152107946,Charles Schubert,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,22 Jun,Stop buying stamps all together if you really want to assert change at the USPS. Use any other business in the free market for your needs.
22,152107946,Shanta Harrison-Sullivan,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,22 Jun,"I wouldn't go so far as to say it needs to be defunded....geez.  I definitely enjoy having a post office so close by, and I don't think anyone is so bothered by the level of service that they'd want to see it closed!  I say, when you receive bad service, complain!  Get it on record with the main office.  I'm a huge supporter of the USPS.  The government has put them in a very tough spot financially and the employees often feel the brunt of that.  I empathize with them, however, that's no excuse for dishing out bad customer service.  File a complaint."
23,152107946,Charles Schubert,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,22 Jun,I hear your venting LaKia. I sympathize and feel your anger because my late father who was 90 was treated so poorly at the USPS and really upset him hence me. I worked at that Park Hill station for several months and couldn‚Äôt take the terrible work conditions. To call it a circus is an insult to circuses! It‚Äôs ranked as one of the worst in Colorado. My suggestions:
24,152107946,Natasha Johnson,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,22 Jun,Go to the Postal service spot on Krameria in the Kings Soopers shopping center the owner is Shambe Abdul he‚Äôs the owner is been in business For years I use to work there when I was A teenager back in 2001!
25,152107946,Charles Schubert,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,22 Jun,Well Shanta I‚Äôd tend to agree with you if the complaints actually did something.
26,152107946,LaKia Thomas,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,22 Jun,Thank you all for your comments. I filed a complaint and they have forwarded the information to the Regional Post Master. Unfortunately we‚Äôre still having issues and the mail carrier even lied about us having an animal outside during delivery. Thanks again for the support.
27,152107946,Ben S.,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,23 Jun,yes.  that manager at the post office told us the workers have in their contract that they are allowed to cut between houses    yeah. and trampled my trees and flowers that are trying to grow.  no thanks.  i‚Äôll put up an electric fence if i have to.  but yet we get nasty grams when there is a temp delivery person.  the complaints go no where when we have asked.  oh. and if they say they they will come out and see the problem themselves. ask for an appointment.  no response. just a try to pass the issue along with no resolution.  if you need to send something. i have stopped all together and used the ups store on 7 and colorado.  i have a box there and always.  always the best service! they will see what is the best savings even if it is usps and can ship it from there.  if there is a line it moves.
28,152107946,Charlotte Gavin Goens,‚Ä¢ Skyland,25 Jun,Yes they can
29,152107946,John Gratton,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Jun,I don't even get mail except maybe once a week. It's obviously being tossed out or held somewhere.

I told him no, wanted to see how he handled a no.  He told me to F off.  Made me laugh.  Will pay attention more next time. Just in case.  Didn‚Äôt think much into it.(edited)"
4,139582156,Heather Mann,‚Ä¢ Central Park,30 Mar 20,Rob Allen yes he was not very polite at all-  he was wearing a black shirt and jeans and had sandy brown / blonde hair if I remember.  Maybe 14?  That‚Äôs funny
5,139582156,Heather Mann,‚Ä¢ Central Park,30 Mar 20,"He came to my door too and it was like 630/7 pm dinner time , I was polite and said no and he gave me attitude and said he only needed two more people to sign up and asked for my credit card info and I said I didn‚Äôt want to give my card info out that way and he asked for cash and I said sorry I don‚Äôt have any on me and he kinda huffed and seemed annoyed and walked off ... I felt bad ... but he was pretty rude too! Smh not sure if it is legit but same thing happened to us. Was a younger boy"
6,139582156,Rob Allen,‚Ä¢ Beeler Park,30 Mar 20,Sounds like our little friend. :-)

2,135107716,David R.,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights East,23 Jan 20,As long as there are guns there will be gun violence.
3,135107716,David A.,‚Ä¢ University Hills,1y,"And as long as there are people, there will be violence.(edited)"
4,135107716,Hazel Shields,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,23 Jan 20,"I work with Denver Area Youth Services and I go into the detention center and I do court ordered substance-abuse evaluation‚Äôs with kids. 80% of them have gun charges. Not all of them come from poverty and not all of them are doing drugs. One thing is for sure it is really easy for these kids to get guns.It is almost always about power, being powerful or intimidating others."
5,135107716,Cody A.,‚Ä¢ Hampden Heights North,23 Jan 20,"Sure, if they are in an environment where power is the currency since money isn't stable or available. If you work with these kids then you should know that poverty is a breeding ground for all kinds of crime and violence and unplanned pregnancies and many other consequences of people living in desperation. There isn't much gun or gang violence in Silicon Valley."
6,135107716,Sharron Williams,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,1y,"I feel that if more parents spent time with their children, and parent their kids then most kids would not be committing the crimes, or be the victim of the crime. Why, because they'd be at home with their family rather than running the streets. Most parents don't know where their kids are at 90% of the time, they don't know the kid's name or anything about the parents or the environment in which they are going. Sometimes society needs to step back and do things the old  school way. My mother would never let us out the door without telling her where we were going, what time we'd be home before 10 pm, and then who are the parents. Later, mom would go over and introduce herself to the other parents if she saw a friend ship developing. Parents need to get more involved in their kids rather than the cell phone. Yeah, I said this! You go into stores or places and the kids yelling to the mother and she's so busy on the phone she can't stop to pay attention to the child. Yeah, I;m calling you out!!!!!(edited)"
7,135107716,Michelle Conder,‚Ä¢ South Mar Lee/Brentwood,23 Jan 20,Perhaps if the cost if living in this city want so outrageous parents wouldn't have to work two or three jobs for the child to have a home and could be there to be a family. It's a bigger problem than just poor parenting.
8,135107716,Lindsay Brown,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Jan 20,This seems like the VERY LEAST the mayor could do. Took him long enough.
9,135107716,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Jan 20,"I think that a mentor ship would be a good idea of showing more positive ways of life, from men who could be an example of positive influence"
10,135107716,Diane Sokolowski,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Jan 20,A one hour conference call is performative and non productive.   The mayor needs to have a 3 hour in person community meeting as a start.  This event is merely a way for the mayor to check a box.
11,135107716,Janet R.,‚Ä¢ University Neighbors,24 Jan 20,That was my first feeling. Meet people. Form a committee tasked with researching solutions. Meet people again. Implement solutions with the most potential from both long-term and short-term perspectives.
12,135107716,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Jan 20,"A call is a step forward to hear concerns and ideas to move forward. Always a complaint, sometimes baby steps r a beginning there have been programs in the past and people who have reached out to gang members and tried other solutions, parents need to play a part with their teens as well as a prevention as far as their anger, etc."
13,135107716,Diane Sokolowski,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Jan 20,We are way passed baby steps.
14,135107716,Ambria Reed,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,23 Jan 20,Exactly
15,135107716,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Jan 20,"Why is in person better than expressing on a conference,call in person will cost the city money for security etc."
16,135107716,Lindsay Brown,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Jan 20,"I mean, if Mayor Hancock can show up to Cyclebar Denver‚Äôs Union Station grand opening, I feel like he could meet in person with the community when young people are dying. Esp when his development projects and the gentrification of Denver are adding to the problem."
17,135107716,Diane Sokolowski,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Jan 20,"Because he would need to look people, grieving parents, in the eye.  He's from there!"

19,135107716,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Jan 20,"I believe he probably has already done that in a more personal way, he is not at fault and cannot prevent it from happening redevelopment and gentrification has nothing to do with youth violence, this has been going on long before redevelopment and gentrification, youth could care less about those too things, why would youth be killing each other because of adult issues."
20,135107716,Diane Sokolowski,‚Ä¢ Central Park,23 Jan 20,"If you follow activists from the impacted communities,  you know that they are not impressed with this feeble attempt.  Nor are they impressed with the mayor's facilitation of said gentrification."
21,135107716,Ambria Reed,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,23 Jan 20,"That's great and all, but he needs to get out here IN PERSON to address the violence that is killing our kids."
22,135107716,"Mayor's Office, Director of Strategic Communications Theresa Marchetta",‚Ä¢ City of Denver,27 Jan 20,"We are listening, Ambria, and committed to making an impact. Thank you for sharing your thoughts."
23,135107716,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Jan 20,"How does the Mayor facilitate, gentrification? He lives close to the area where much of the violence has gone on, I haven‚Äôt seen response from any activist in Aurora or Montebello, if they even have any. Where did u see an activist speak on the matter everyone is saddened by the violence, but there r matters that need to be done, it is not one simple solution. What do u mean Diane, he is from there? From where? Most of u have never ever dealt with these sort of issues so don‚Äôt be so fast to judge as to what needs to be done and how. Years ago I had a friend her son was killed in front of their house, never found out who killed him, if it could be solved so easily don‚Äôt u think it would be solved by now so it would not be anymore teen deaths. I feel empathy and much sadness, for those that has lost their child I can‚Äôt imagine having to loose my child, in fact the mayor has teenagers too. People on ND seem to have complaints but no solutions for too much but fault and pointing the finger in the opposite direction, other than looking at self to find or suggestions for the problem."
24,135107716,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Jan 20,"Then Diane what r ur big girl solutions, since u r so negative, I bet u have no idea where to begin meeting the grieving is not a solution to the problem. There is no comfort in loosing ur child unnecessarily. U figure it out u have so many ideas, express them in whatever way u want to make a difference. U and Ambria ought to brainstorm some solutions."
25,135107716,Kathy Wright,‚Ä¢ Skyland,23 Jan 20,Diane u and Ambria Reed should submit ur ideas for an end on conference call or whatever way u feel productive and useful.
26,135107716,Ambria Reed,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,23 Jan 20,"Kathy, do you work for the mayor or something? Baby steps for children being killed? Mike Coffman has already had several meetings in Aurora, and Hancock can only do one phone conference. So he doesn't have to answer to people and control the narrative? C'mon."
27,135107716,Ambria Reed,‚Ä¢ Green Valley Ranch,24 Jan 20,"Jay Miller Yup. I mean, if Coffman can do it, why can't Hancock?"
28,135107716,Ron S.,‚Ä¢ Hampden South,23 Jan 20,Is the call-in number really the '302' Area Code versus '303'?

0,151955996,LInda Poletti,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"Honestly I can see HD dilemma!  I've seen some people react very negatively  when an innocent employee who is covering the front door to an establishment stops them about masks.  It's a tough situation.  An employee shouldn't have to be at risk by enforcing the wearing of masks!  I was at HD recently (wearing a mask) and I feel like I saw a box of masks by customer service (I could be wrong) and maybe they should at the very least have the box by the front door and 'offer' a mask to anyone who enters if they don't have one.  this might help a bit but again, if someone is refusing, it's certainly not the responsibility of any of the employees to put themselves at risk to enforce this.  I really feel for these retail establishments and dealing with people who just refuse to think about others."
1,151955996,Shari Wilkins-Duley,‚Ä¢ North Park Hill,17 Jun,I‚Äôve seen ACE have someone stand at the door and turn customers away if they didn‚Äôt have a mask on.
2,151955996,Kate Killin,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,17 Jun,"The refusal to wear a mask makes no sense to me. But yes, I have been going to Ace on the Fax which is incredible and I feel so safe going there.  Plus Ace on the Fax is a franchise owned by a local woman whereas HD is a corporation so I'd rather my money go to Ace."
3,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"Good to know this. I will definitely avoid HD because I don't want to go anywhere where there is threat of violence since I think that is a very selfish and ""primitive"" way of expressing oneself. I'd rather support a woman-owned business anyway and avoid as much obnoxious behavior as I can."
4,151955996,Erik Flick,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,I too have been avoiding HD and giving all my business to ACE because of their policies. Please error on the side of caution.
5,151955996,Tayo McGuirk,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"No shoes, no shirt, no service! No mask, no service! It's a public health issue."
6,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"I've heard that some men refuse to wear a mask because they think it makes them look ""weak"". So only having concern for their own vanity and no concern for the well-being of others is supposed to make them look ""strong""? To me it just makes them look ignorant, pigheaded and selfish, not being qualities that I associate with strength."
7,151955996,Rox Kunz,‚Ä¢ Mayfair,17 Jun,hmm I wonder where they got those ideas from...‚Äùour‚Äù dear leaderü§®
8,151955996,Patricia Monheit,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,The True Value on Colfax is also locally owned and customers there seem very mask compliant.
9,151955996,Valerie Carter,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"The customers yes, the staff...not so much."
10,151955996,Dorota O'Neill,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"Disappointing about HD... a few weeks ago they were good about enforcing masks, and turning away customers who weren't wearing them. I guess that's changed now. Will be shopping at True Value then."
11,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"Dorota, enforcing is one thing, doing battle with some a-hole who gets violent about it is another whole can of worms. I don't blame anybody for not wanting to get into fisticuffs with someone too selfish and primitive to want to put on a mask."
12,151955996,Justin Hersom,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,Kelly Taylor or shot
13,151955996,Shawna Murphy,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,It‚Äôs the same at Lowe‚Äôs and Walmart. When I asked employees about it I was told management instructed them not to enforce the mask law.
14,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"There's a big difference between a store policy to require/ask for masks on customers and one that doesn't bother. I can well understand not wanting to do battle with someone who turns savage about a small request like ""please wear a mask in the store"" but to places that don't even bother trying to get customers to comply, I'd rather avoid them because the more people who wear masks the safer we all will be. Personally, for someone who's been following the stay-at-home orders since mid-March hoping to avoid a re-spiking in illness in Denver, I would prefer keeping myself safe and others as well, since their health impacts mine and the entire community. Being locked in at home is getting a little old. . ."
15,151955996,Joanne Spillman,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"Never shop at Home Depot, anyway; would rather go to True Value on Colfax."
16,151955996,Laura Waligorski,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"I‚Äôve avoided HD for years. Ace on the Fax hires very helpful employees and, oh - they‚Äôre trying to keep us safe. No brainer for me."
17,151955996,Rick and Cathy Reynolds,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,Retailers will require masks and distancing when 100% of their customers are mask-less and are boycotted by the 75% of cautious customers.
18,151955996,Betty Miller,‚Ä¢ Central Park,46w,"I witnessed 2 customers verbally assaulting the poor gentleman at the door who was enforcing the mask rule and threatening to ""kick his ass"" when I went shortly after it first reopened.  Something similar happened again the last time I was there."
19,151955996,Olga Guerra,‚Ä¢ Hale,17 Jun,They could and should call the police!
20,151955996,LInda Poletti,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,18 Jun,Completely agree with you Betty Miller!  It's a very slippery slope for employees who are really at risk trying to enforce this.
21,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"Personally, I wish the governor would make mask-wearing manditory, but then those who only think to frame it as a ""freedom"" issue would go ballistic and likely become more belligerent than they are already. "
22,151955996,Patricia Monheit,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,I think in Denver they are mandatory.
23,151955996,Andrew Sweet,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,Thank you all for weighing in.  I think the boycott idea is most appropriate.  Patronize those places that respect ALL people‚Äôs safety.
24,151955996,Laura Leckband,‚Ä¢ Northeast Park Hill,17 Jun,I do t think it‚Äôs fair to blame HD. I still go there - I just give the jerks a wide berth.
25,151955996,Justin Hersom,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"Last time I was at hd on Quebec it was basically impossible to give anyone a wide berth, especially the people who believe the whole thing is made up and are not concerned with giving space"
26,151955996,Sheryl Olson,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"If smaller ACE and True Value can provide staff to comply with our regs, why can't big box HD.  I concur with Andrew S."
27,151955996,Betty Miller,‚Ä¢ Central Park,46w,"This is obviously anecdotal, but it seems that more conscientious, less pig-headed and aggressive people are shopping at the smaller stores.  So, maybe it's an easier task. "
28,151955996,Margaret Baldwin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,"City of Denver has advised businesses to call 311 to report customers who  refuse to wear masks and not to serve them. No shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service."
29,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"While refusing to serve the mask-less seems like a good solution, I wouldn't want to be the cashier who refuses service to someone who's going to go ape-sh!t over being asked to wear a mask in the first place. I can imagine that person throwing hammers or whatever they are trying to buy because they can't get service because they won't wear a mask. That will prove how ""strong"" they are. I also don't expect they will wait around for 311 to send someone to deal with them, either."

31,151955996,Margaret Baldwin,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,311 should be called when they enter the store per City of Denver guidelines. Of course no one should try to physically stop a maskless customer. Nothing in any store is worth risking injury or worse.

33,151955996,William Jones,‚Ä¢ Skyland,17 Jun,"Customers can call 311 as well.  A while ago, the Bass Pro Shop at Northfield had about 50% compliance.  They said an inspector would visit the store."
34,151955996,Zak Bugaj,‚Ä¢ Congress Park,17 Jun,"People here in Denver have been shot over a mask argument. I like Ace on the fax, and Lowe's in Aurora. They do a good job of spreading people out and both have a giant hand sanitizer when you first walk in To sanitize upon entering and leaving. Sometimes I have to go to home depot I just wear my mask avoid people get my stuff and go. They are trying but they missed the timeframe as far as requiring masks at the door to enter. Since they made it this far it would be hell to change now."
35,151955996,Andrew Sweet,‚Ä¢ South Park Hill,17 Jun,Think they could change but it‚Äôs too expensive to do so.  Perhaps stock holders will raise the issue if business goes down
36,151955996,Kelly Taylor,‚Ä¢ East Colfax,17 Jun,"Some people will never wear masks. They don't understand the reasons for doing it and don't accept the science. They think they know better so they will do whatever they want, no matter what."
