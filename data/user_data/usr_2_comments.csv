0,183301151,Mike Tourneau,• Mayfair,12 Apr,Can’t wait for people to start justifying this.
1,183301151,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,12 Apr,Mike Tourneau I'm pretty horrified all this happened seemingly without the consult of the people in the neighborhood that are directly affected.
2,183301151,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,1w,"I'm not surprised its flying under the radar at all. Its just another facet of how society is changing, the PC culture of it all."
3,183301151,Melanie Weiss-Turner,• South Park Hill,13 Apr,https://www.westword.com/news/denver-homeless-safe-camping-site-concept-park-hill-hancock-11936647
4,183301151,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,13 Apr,"Melanie Weiss-Turner I wonder how many people in that encampment have an actionable plan to help themselves now that they have clean shelter paid for by taxpayers. While the article poses good news in the few months since it opened, it'll be interesting to see if these camps have a lasting effect on the people who were helped by it. I certainly hope so. That being said, it still sucks that this new camp in question was set up without communication to park hill neighbors beforehand. Its an awful way to go about it."
5,183301151,Loris Venegas,• South Park Hill,13 Apr,"This hasn't flown under the radar. The site was selected and there are community meetings you may participate in: Saturday, May 1 from 10a.m.-11:30a.m. — Tour a Safe Outdoor Space @ 1595 N. Pearl St."
6,183301151,Kelley Dawkins,• Historic Montclair,13 Apr,The church itself is offering a Community Conversation around it: https://www.facebook.com/events/276809797283328/ 
7,183301151,Loris Venegas,• South Park Hill,13 Apr,"For the record, I don't like the idea of human beings living in tents in a church parking lot as their housing-ever! Its intention is a temporary, safe, outdoor shelter. The problem of unaffordable housing and  n Denver is real folks! It is the leading cause of homelessness in Denver!  We as Park Hill residents are fortunate and fear shouldn't be the basis of our judgements. It is not intended to be a free-for-all ""encampment.""  People have to apply for a space and Safe Outdoor Spaces are staffed and managed 24/7 with bathrooms, showers, trash and laundry services, and COVID-19 testing. There will be 45 separate shelters serving 50 people."
8,183301151,Nicole Delmoro,• South Park Hill,13 Apr,Does anyone know what the criteria are for being 1 of the 50 selected?
9,183301151,Tim Townsend,• Mayfair,13 Apr,"NIMBY. Remember, the homeless problem is a citywide issue.  Get the facts on how these small encampments are managed before fear takes over."
10,183301151,Ana Gonzo,• Northeast Park Hill,13 Apr,"Tim Townsend how about you take the time to explain the difference of an SOS instead of being lazy and, idk are you trying to be cool?, throwing around a buzz acronym. Calling people NIMBY will not sway anyone to the benefits of an SOS"
11,183301151,Vanessa Geiger,• South Park Hill,13 Apr,Where can I find the story about the drug lab inside a SOS?

13,183301151,Thomas Myers,• Historic Montclair,13 Apr,People without homes often are in  the situation temporarily. Many people are only a missed payment away from having deal with the stresses of living on the street.
14,183301151,John Schafluetzel,• Central Park,14 Apr,"It's like no one learned anything from this past year. But then, so few acknowledge the lessons from the last recession either. I'm sure there are plenty of people in this very conversation with little to no idea just how precarious their own situation is. Let's just hope, given the pandemic and general state of the nation, we–all of us–avoid finding out. Otherwise, we should be careful the precedents we set now in terms of how the unfortunate among us are treated."
15,183301151,Joe K.,• Cole,13 Apr,Quit fear mongering. The sanctioned camps are NOT ramshackle tent cities. They have not had any problems at the existing sanctioned camps in Cap Hill.
16,183301151,Sara Lange,• South Park Hill,13 Apr,"You can't just tell me to ""quit.""  I have a legitimate concern, and it seems many of my neighbors do too.  Everyone I speak to in person seems genuinely shocked about this news.  I look forward to watching you advocate for one in the Cole neighborhood!  In the meantime, I pay Park Hill property taxes, I'm allowed to voice my fears and pass them on to others."
17,183301151,Rachel Canning,• City Park,13 Apr,"Hey, I know we all have different opinions on what leads to homelessness due to our own unique backgrounds, but I think it's best not to vilify an entire population of people. I understand they make you uncomfortable, but the reality is, our unhoused neighbors deserve compassion and respect just like our housed neighbors do. If you can't get on board with the camp, fine. At least let them have some peace, and don't make their lives even harder than they currently are. Just direct your focus elsewhere and let them be. And if you really don't want them there, you might like to consider how you could help them rather than fear mongering about their presence. Helping them feel empowered and safe is the best way to lessen the impact of our unhoused friends on neighborhoods. Everyone deserves safety, security, and respect, regardless of their housing status, their ability levels, whether or not they suffer from addiction, etc. There's really no room to argue on this."
18,183301151,Gabe Dusenbury,• Hale,4 days ago,"Thank you! I mean...look I get for the people of South Park Hill this really IS in their backyard. And they would've preferred a voice in the process (which I kind of read as the right to say no to it, which the church didn't ask for, the church just decided to do it. That's the church's own legal right as far as I can tell). But umm...it's happening. It's happening for 6 months, at a time when the people who will be in the Safe Outdoor Space really need it. It'd be nice to see the neighborhood come to grips with that and make the best of it instead of having a freakout over it. Just my two cents. Hope to see some of you all there volunteering at the site at some point."
19,183301151,Lynn Hartfield,• City Park,13 Apr,"How about we both admit each side has a point? No one, no matter how sympathetic and well-intentioned, wants human beings living in tents on their front lawns, and that sentiment is magnified when the encampments come with drugs, trash, human waste, etc. The Safe Outdoor Spaces are trying to address an entrenched problem by providing spaces that can be maintained and providing services to the people living there. They will probably be very helpful to higher functioning people who have lost their housing due to financial problems, but they will likely not address the many people who are on the street due to mental health and drug problems (which often go together). Take a deep breath, all. This is a citywide problem, and  Cap Hill, RiNo and Curtis Park shouldn't have to bear it alone."
20,183301151,Gabe Dusenbury,• Hale,4 days ago,!
21,183301151,Jeff Peshut,• South Park Hill,13 Apr,Does this so-called sanctioned encampment comply with Denver's zoning ordinance?  Do we know how many of the 50 people have previously owned or rented homes in Denver?  Will be there only temporarily as a result of temporary economic circumstances?  Suffer from some form of primary addiction?  Some form of chronic mental health condition? Some form of chronic physical health condition?  Have criminal records?  Have recently moved to Denver?  Were experiencing homelessness when they moved here?  Lots to know and understand.
22,183301151,Norma Clark,• East Colfax,13 Apr,"Do you really think you know about even your neighbors on any of those issues. Living in tents or houses doesn't change the fact you never know. Especially  people with money ,who can afford lawyers to get them off."
23,183301151,RoSean Howard,• South Park Hill,13 Apr,"Anyone can be homeless, paying off doctors, education, lawyers, etc.  I am highly educated and yes, I have been homeless and not by my doing.  I also worked for the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless for little pay.  I know my clients did not deserve what happened to nearly all of them.  Drugs was an escape for the hopeless; many were very good, kind and caring people.  So, to remedy the trash, put more trash barrels out or recycle bins.  Let the camps be vested in the environment they live.  Right on to the Churches and donations that have gone above and beyond their abilities. Not all homeless are bad but like police, it only takes one or two bad guys to ruin a reputation.  Where can you send homeless people, anyway?  Any place can be bad or good.  Thanks to South Park Hill for getting out of the comfort zone and stepping up to help humanity.  Now, helping young teens becoming independent may reduce future houseless people, but there are no jobs when young ones are competing for the jobs older people need, and VOCATIONS are minimal or non-existent.  Simultaneously, we must work on current homeless and prevent further - and our country does a great job of segregating the poor from the wealthy.  I Love Park Hill because poor, hard working people and the wealthy people care, not just the old growth and old brick homes, but the diversity of my community.  I have lived here my whole life.  ...And, the new transplants join our thinking.  Thanks to you, too.  Thanks, Kozlowicz, NO fear-mongering."
24,183301151,Ana Gonzo,• Northeast Park Hill,13 Apr,"RoSean Howard People are not fear-mongering as much as they are legitimately scared of the element of change a SOS can bring to their doorstep. The way to remedy, or at least lessen and sway people, is to inform not point fingers and all caps NIMBY at them. The website Tim Townsend posted is helpful and may sway some who are on the fence. Park Hill UM did the SOS a tremendous disservice by not getting ahead of the information. Try to remember, all of a sudden word got out a ""homeless encampment"" is being located in the middle of Park Hill. Neighbors are envisioning the encampments in and around Cap Hill that had rat infestation, super spreader events, criminal activity, etc. Being kind to everyone also encompasses those who are scared of how this will impact their neighborhood and lives, not just the homeless."
25,183301151,Cynthia Pesantez,• Northeast Park Hill,13 Apr,"There but for the grace of God go I. Any one of us could be homeless in a city with astronomical housing prices and few safety nets. How many people lost jobs in the pandemic? How many lost housing due to banks and landlords’ inflexibility once the pandemic hit? It could have been me. It could have been you. We have a responsibility to help our neighbors. My goodness we are so fortunate. I think every day how lucky I am to be fed, clothed, housed, with relative financial security. Don’t you? Don’t you ever look around your space and go, “holy moly, am I lucky!” So many of our neighbors don’t have that. It’s not our place to judge each one asking why and how they are now unhoused. Instead, let’s help! Let’s volunteer at that church if they need it. Let’s offer odd jobs to those who want them. Let’s give of our abundance, share so more can have a little. Let us meet our unhoused neighbors with love and compassion, not fear and contempt. We are, all of us, human, and have erred in different ways. Some big some small. Some with the good fortune to bounce back, and some not. But we all deserve grace, and patience, and agency, and help. Don’t give in to fear. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you are so different from your unhoused neighbors. There but by the grace of God go we all."

28,183301151,Patricia Fox,• East Colfax,13 Apr,"Sara Lange In what way are they treated differently? If someone commits a crime, is arrested and sentenced, at what point does homelessness play a role?"

31,183301151,John Schafluetzel,• Central Park,14 Apr,"Ooh! Ditto! Something with 3 beds, 2 baths would be great! Happy to take the OP's place off her hands."
32,183301151,Kelley Dawkins,• Historic Montclair,13 Apr,It's wonderful to see a church helping to provide shelter and services to the homeless in a city where housing prices are astronomically high. It seems to me like they are living their Christian values.
33,183301151,Sara Lange,• South Park Hill,13 Apr,"It seems to me they should shift their focus to reopening their church and school to in-person visits.  That is what people in the neighborhood understood they were moving near.  They understood the traffic, the schedules, the clientele that might frequent those places.  If UMC doesn't feel it's safe enough to open for school or worship, how can they safely take on the task of providing responsible housing?!"
34,183301151,Debby Schwartz,• Historic Montclair,13 Apr,How about putting the camps in the Governors and Mayors backyards?????????
35,183301151,Drew Lavin,• South Park Hill,13 Apr,It will be a block from Senator Hickenlooper's house.
36,183301151,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,6 days ago,"The backyard argument doesn't include the support services also necessary to pull someone out of homelessness. Perhaps talking with someone in that situation, understanding the trauma of living in a very unstable situation, and all that it takes to recover from it would help understanding. It's truly not a black-and-white situation. Some folks just don't ask for help until it's too late."
37,183301151,Laura Leckband,• Northeast Park Hill,13 Apr,Please volunteer at the existing site before you make any judgements. They could use more volunteers. 
38,183301151,Robin Wells,• Cheesman Park,14 Apr,That waiver is pretty intense😳 Why aren’t residents responsible for most of the tasks? It would be a start in learning responsibility I would think.
39,183301151,Debby Schwartz,• Historic Montclair,1w,I didn’t know we paid taxes to have homeless camps move in next door??? Be that as it May! What is the Governor and Mayor doing about this situation! Some of these people want to stay in tents and the ones that need help to transition out of the camps into housing should be taken care of so they can move on! The Governor and Mayor are ignoring this and just moving people are the city like Chess pieces !♟♟♟(edited)

1,182618509,Emma Griffis,• Congress Park,6 Apr,Great news!
2,182618509,Jasmine Decelles,• East Colfax,7 Apr,"I would like to hear what the neighbors of Park Hill feel about this- I’m sorry to sound insensitive, but I saw the debacle in Cap Hill- it was and still is, a terrible dangerous mess-having drugs addicts roaming about - nothing’s safe as it is. I’m not sure how this is a great thing. Just my opinion."
3,182618509,Gina Dunn,• South Park Hill,8 Apr,"They have to shut it down because it is a mess. If you have been near/in the downtown area this past year, it is also a sty. I pass it every time I go to visit my mom. It's  on many street corners. They have to keep moving it around because it gets so nasty and dangerous. Why? Because the people who live there will not keep it clean/safe and the city of Denver lets it  happen ! I don't know who would want to visit this city when it is like this.  I don't go downtown unless I have to. My out of town friends have seen the mess on the national media."

12,182618509,Lee Farver,• South Park Hill,10 Apr,"Before People call me ""Privileged"" I grew up poor.  My parents had me when they were 18 and we lived in trailer parks as well as an actual camper when I was young.  My parents didn't do drugs, they just had kids too young with no money. They didn't use excuses, they didn't take any handouts, they worked their butts off and saved every penny that didn't go to supporting their kids.  They taught me and my brother what hard work could do.  When I first moved to Denver I moved to the highlands when things were still rough.  I had compassion and would give food or a few bucks to the homeless that sat out on the corners around the major intersections in the neighborhood. That compassion soon faded as I would head out on a run down the cherry creek trail every evening after work and see the same people i tried to help talking to drug dealers on that same trail or literally had needles in their arms as i ran by.  I had my first kid living in that house in the highlands and didn't feel safe running with a stroller down the cherry creek trail with her in it.  As much as i loved that house and neighborhood I CHOSE to move to Park hill for a more stable and safe environment.  So now that I feel like a choice was made for my neighborhood without any consideration i can be angry.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for many of years.  There are jobs out there people even during this pandemic. However, you have to be reliable, hard working, and straight.  So before you all start judging me I will pose this offer.  For any of you that believe this is a good thing and support decisions like this being made without any neighborhood involvement my offer is this:  I will buy anyone that is willing to have a homeless family camp in their back yard for a period of time a nice tent, i'll pay for the utilities, and some additional amenities if you're willing to put my money where your mouth is and support these same people living in your backyard.  Because honestly, the parking lot is in the backyard of people that live on that street."
13,182618509,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,10 Apr,"I don't see anything wrong with priviledge. Your parents sound like mine, lots of elbow grease to get ahead. That's the beauty of this country."
14,182618509,Gabe Dusenbury,• Hale,15 Apr,"PHMC! We always buy pumpkins there in the fall, I hit my own vaccine immunity April 23rd and it'll be cool to have an opportunity to volunteer locally to help people who are really struggling, especially now."

I will be making two trips tomorrow to take all of the nice things that Heidi Harris and her brother brought me on Thursday but will be sorting and prepping more then too.

2,182732086,Valerie Carter,• East Colfax,7 Apr,From the article: Chandler said the collaborative has been in contact with the local neighborhood organizations including Greater Park Hill Community Inc. and will host two community meetings in May to provide more details about the site. The collaborative is also inviting people to tour the existing site on Pearl Street to see how they operate.

6,182732086,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,7 Apr,"As a volunteer with the Women's Homelessness Initiative and after many visits to the 14th & Grant site to deliver food and water, it is well operated. One of my fellow Park Hill UCC church members volunteered overnight there from 11 pm to 3am, and she, a physician, says it was orderly. The fence is tall, and there is a locked gate. If we need extra monitoring around the perimeter, let's talk with the PH Methodist Church about this as well as determine if additional monitoring is necessary. We can also have our Forest Avenue Parkway patrolled if people are concerned. Ultimately, people using this SOS site are like us and deserve safe shelter until other options are available in our severely overpriced and underserved city. Where else do these people go? The SOS site is safe, quiet, and well managed. We all want safe neighborhoods and living spaces. If there is a concern with what is around it, then contact the local police precinct for additional patrols. The people within the SOS site are peaceful. It is a 6 month permit. Also keep in mind that Senator Hickenlooper resides 1.5 blocks from it. Since we can't build affordable housing fast enough, where do unhoused neighbors go?"
7,182732086,Michael King,• South Park Hill,7 Apr,Please!
8,182732086,Patty Moody,• South Park Hill,7 Apr,How much is the collaborative group paying this church?  Also are they ensuring no sex offenders are living by the school?  Needle disposals?  😡

10,182732086,Jim Miller,• Congress Park,7 Apr,Take a walk up Park from Colfax to Larimer..and then back on 22nd. That is what will be coming to your neighborhood
11,182732086,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,7 Apr,"How about 14th close to downtown? Right on the sidewalks , in front of homes and businesses. I wouldn't feel safe walking down there , nor having my kids walk down there"
12,182732086,Michael Davis,• South Park Hill,7 Apr,I highly encourage all to find out how these people qualify.  It took almost 30 days to fill the camp on Grant.  Not just everyone can come in whenever they want.
13,182732086,Michael King,• South Park Hill,7 Apr,Qualify?  Who cares about qualification... just don’t want it period!
14,182732086,Debra Roads,• Congress Park,7 Apr,Go visit the tent camp on Pearl street. The tent camp is run really well and the residents are so nice. My neighbors and I have made dinner and delivered it to their 40 residents.  I live in Congress Park and would be so proud if we would do this too.

16,182732086,Scott Bulfin,• Central Park,7 Apr,"It doesn't make you a bad or uncaring person to not want a homeless camp where you live. It is a serious issue that needs to be resolved and rotating these camps from Denver neighborhood to neighborhood is not a solution, just a bandaid. I would suggest the city of Denver take the $100 million  it is getting from the economic windfall boost of getting the 2021 MLB ALL-STAR game from Atlanta and now to Denver and invest it in solving the revolving homeless camp issue. Also all cities/states are getting a windfall from Biden's 2 trillion aid package, so some of that surplus can go to tackling the homeless camp issue."
17,182732086,Heather Smith,• South Park Hill,7 Apr,Seems like Hancock would want to cleanup the downtown area before the ALL STAR game so I predict we’ll see more of this moving into neighborhoods.
18,182732086,Erin Pier,• North Park Hill,7 Apr,"There was a homeless man who used to wander around my block. I’d see him from time to time and we’d chat. He was one of the kindest people I’ve ever met...former PTA president at one of our neighborhood schools, and the father of three successful adults - one rather well known. He was brilliant, but ill, and our country failed to meet his needs. So he wound up sorting through my dumpster looking for scrap metal to make ends meet. "
19,182732086,Jeff Winchester,• South Park Hill,7 Apr,Wake up Erin.  Because we don’t want human feces and needles next door to a preschool is not too much to ask. This is BS and you know it! Yes Denver is an expensive city to live in. Guess what? Other places are more affordable. They live here because suckers like you enable them. Shame on you.
20,182732086,Melody Hodges,• East Colfax,7 Apr,"Some people work awfully hard to hold onto their preconceived notions, even when faced with evidence they are wrong.  So sad to see such closed minds, so much unfounded fear and the unwillingness to learn or contribute."
21,182732086,Michael King,• South Park Hill,7 Apr,What does that even mean? You do not know me or my past contributions to society!  I am all about helping others!   The issue is we are exposing innocent children and families to something they did not choose to be exposed to!  Wasn’t our/their choice.. that’s the issue!  We all deserve to have a choice and say in our lives...
22,182732086,Norma Clark,• East Colfax,7 Apr,So where would you like to home them?
23,182732086,Norma Clark,• East Colfax,8 Apr,"Jeff Farquhar  I  Myself no Jeff. I have a roof over my head. but you are the same people who go don't pay rent. Pay housekeepers a $100000 a year to clean their homes. We the people, Find a solution. You go poor people until it comes to your house.  There are schools in every neighborhood. There are young children in every neighborhood. Find a solution. Work together to find a way to get these people off the drugs that need help. Work programs. It will get worse before it gets better. Find ways to help instead of being a just not on my door complainer!"
24,182732086,Jan Delsi,• East Colfax,7 Apr,"I am also concerned, if the legislators think this is such a wonderful idea, then they should have them set up the camps near their homes, not ours!!!"
25,182732086,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,7 Apr,It’s near Senator Hickenlooper’s home.
26,182732086,Michael King,• South Park Hill,7 Apr,"Don’t know.. your backyard?  Not mine or our local church, or nearby neighbors.  Don’t know the answer.. it’s sucks, feel bad for all.  Think ultimately up to our local gov, but they only push this kind of crap through under radar without most knowing anything about it.. is that ok?  No it is not.  I am done bitching, no real solution other than voicing our opinion..  Good luck to all with this terrible situation"
27,182732086,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,7 Apr,Stop complaining and misinforming. Do your homework and be part of the solution.
28,182732086,Jeff Farquhar,• Mayfair,7 Apr,Patricia Smith I’m about done with your misinforming. We aren’t idiots!! We’ve seen these camps! See ya at the tour on May 1st Pattie.
29,182732086,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,2w,Dispense with the personal attacks. I work and have volunteered for 4 years. Get to work on the solutions and get informed. I too don’t want drug dealers and unsafe conditions. Learn the difference.(edited)
30,182732086,Ingrid Underwood,• South Park Hill,2w,It’s a catch22.  I understand the homeless situation must be addressed.  We have spoken to several homeless people living in their cars and watched the documentary Tent City USA.  
31,182732086,Max Blanchard,• East Colfax,2w,"I want to thank Patricia Smith and Michael Davis for the information they provided about the safe outdoor space. I think it’s fair to be apprehensive but from what I have read about the official outdoor space in Cap Hill, it sounds like it was successful in helping people escape homelessness. And the concerns people had at the start were squashed once the program began. Trying to avoid the not in my backyard mentality (NIMBYism) can be tough, but I’m happy to know our city is at least trying to help people.(edited)"
32,182732086,Melody Hodges,• East Colfax,8 Apr,"Thinking the camp at the church will be like the camp at Morley is comparing apples and oranges.  Why the difference is so difficult to comprehend is beyond me.  More camps like the one at the church means fewer camps like Morley.  That's the whole point of this, to help people while keeping them safe from the neighborhood and vice versa.  The reality is that the homeless keep coming and the problem will most likely get worse before it gets better once the eviction moratorium is lifted.  People need hope to recover and the sanctioned camps offer that.  Without hope, people turn to drugs and other activities that drag them into places like the camp at Morley.  They're not necessarily bad people, just people that have had bad things happen to them.  It's not right to deny them the opportunity to pull themselves out of a dire situation by denying them a camp like the sanctioned ones which offer hope and a way out, and instead warehouse them somewhere where you don't have to see them.  This camp isn't being placed in Park Hill to punish the neighborhood - I believe the intent it to spread them throughout the city so all neighborhoods share in the recovery."
33,182732086,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,8 Apr,"I agree there is no comparison to SOS and Morey. It's important that we determine how to avoid that situation, and also to keep in mind how we can show how it's possible to make this work."

13,182464076,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,9 Apr,"Dear Neighbors, our cherished Park Hill has a long history of coming together to serve social justice. Anyone remember the Ghost Post program from 1993/1994? This is the Park Hill I know and where I am proud to live. People have come together for decades, and we are again capable of this. Who participated in the Ghost Post program to keep Halloween safe? The first year we did it, we had brick mobile phones (1994), which my boss donated in the days she worked at Cellular One so each block could immediately report a disturbance. When we come together to participate, it lightens the load. https://denver.cbslocal.com/2018/10/31/ghost-post-park-hill-halloween/"

15,182464076,Jan Nadav,• South Park Hill,12 Apr,"FYI -- Only one neighbor was contacted and very briefly at that,  on Glencoe the Friday before Easter."
16,182464076,Lee Farver,• South Park Hill,10 Apr,"Before People call me ""Privileged"" I grew up poor.  My parents had me when they were 18 and we lived in trailer parks as well as an actual camper when I was young.  My parents didn't do drugs, they just had kids too young with no money. They didn't use excuses, they didn't take any handouts, they worked their butts off and saved every penny that didn't go to supporting their kids.  They taught me and my brother what hard work could do.  When I first moved to Denver I moved to the highlands when things were still rough.  I had compassion and would give food or a few bucks to the homeless that sat out on the corners around the major intersections in the neighborhood. That compassion soon faded as I would head out on a run down the cherry creek trail every evening after work and see the same people i tried to help talking to drug dealers on that same trail or literally had needles in their arms as i ran by.  I had my first kid living in that house in the highlands and didn't feel safe running with a stroller down the cherry creek trail with her in it.  As much as i loved that house and neighborhood I CHOSE to move to Park hill for a more stable and safe environment.  So now that I feel like a choice was made for my neighborhood without any consideration i can be angry.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for many of years.  There are jobs out there people even during this pandemic. However, you have to be reliable, hard working, and straight.  So before you all start judging me I will pose this offer.  For any of you that believe this is a good thing and support decisions like this being made without any neighborhood involvement my offer is this:  I will buy anyone that is willing to have a homeless family camp in their back yard for a period of time a nice tent, i'll pay for the utilities, and some additional amenities if you're willing to put my money where your mouth is and support these same people living in your backyard.  Because honestly, the parking lot is in the backyard of people that live on that street."

19,182464076,Eve Cohen,• South Park Hill,11 Apr,"You are being ridiculous. The point of the SOS’s (as you would know if you had read the description of them, which you clearly have not), is that it’s not just sticking someone in a tent in a backyard (or parking lot); it’s connecting them to services such as mental health counseling, job training, and housing resources, providing showers, bathrooms, heating, and electricity, and the end goal is transitioning these people into permanent housing, which the project has had enormous success with. Many of the people housed in the SOS’s actually have jobs, they just don’t make enough to be able to afford rent, which, if you’ve looked at Denver rents lately, you’d understand why.  Please educate yourself about what this project is and how it works before vocalizing your prejudices and preconceptions."

14,184201216,Cam Gu,• North Park Hill,3 days ago,"Denver is by far the most littered city I have ever lived in... and I’m from New Orleans where they literally throw trash on the ground during Mardi Gras.... but it all gets picked up. A lot of it comes from the alley ways/it’s fall out from when trash is picked up/blows out of overfilled trash cans bc the squirrels rip the bags open. I wish that people were forced to bring their trash cans in from the alley way when the street sweepers come down them— bc a lot of the trash is stuck between cans and then blows out into the street. This is why I’m not a huge fan of alley way trash pick up— if trash pick up was in front of our homes, people are more likely to pick up garbage in their front yards that falls out of their trash cans, than they are in the alley way😭😭"
15,184201216,Andrea Lauritzen,• Historic Montclair,3 days ago,I've noticed the trash situation increasingly worse over this past year. I think I'll need to go back to pooch patrol where I walk our dog with some grabbers and a bag. Also it is becoming monotonous to constantly clean up our front yard every few days.

31,141220585,Christopher J.,• Westminster Hills,1y,Hey Tom. Up in the NW burbs. We had so many people looking for and seeking help. One started a group to help neighbors in need get help. It's been awesome to see how quickly any need is responded to.  Often by more than a few offering to help. It's awesome to see people put aside all other considerations (race/religion/politics/social status) and just be neighbors and Americans. Please check it out for yourself (if you're able)https://nextdoor.com/g/h14shobyd/(edited)
32,141220585,"Tom Green, 9NEWS",,21 Mar 20,Good stuff Christopher...I think people helping each other will really surge.  I'm hoping that by sharing these stories we can help it grow - and give folks an idea of the ways that they can help.

19,176771259,Gina Jones,• Central Park,9w,"Keep in mind, affordable housing has a wait list of 2 or more years once you've filled out the application.  Secret to possibly getting in is letting them know on your application you are in transit. If you are disabled and have paperwork showing it these 2 put you at top of list.(edited)"
20,176771259,Nadera Shaikhly,• Del Mar Parkway,18 Feb,This one doesn’t have a waitlist it’s tax credit so they go by income
21,176771259,Gina Jones,• Central Park,22 Feb,Still a wait list. If you call or go by they are all excepting applications. After you return the application is when they let you know about the wait list.  
22,176771259,Elizabeth Bass,• Central Park,25 Feb,There are no waits. You just have to apply and they will rush if you are under contract
23,176771259,Elizabeth Bass,• Central Park,8w,You just have to apply through denver. They will rush if you are under contract. Seriously no wait. I had possession of my home in 30 days. Denver approved me in that timeframe.(edited)

Do you not see people who are experiencing homelessness all of the time near your home? We live in a city that needs to help people when they are experiencing this.  As a member of this community I am thankful that this church has stepped up to the plate.  I’m also fortunate to not be in a position where I am dealing with the same hardship.  Perhaps, think of ways you can assist those in need by volunteering your time or resources.  Invest your energy wisely :)"

It's well known of, and I believe that I read in the past that a smaller part of the work to be done, a hope, is that the disturbance of the construction combined with other efforts toward remedying homelessness about town, might break the gathering of persons there, and of course increase the visitors enjoying the area."

0,180121987,Charles Telles,• Green Valley Ranch,14 Mar,I can understand letting people know about the shelters being open but in reality if you're homeless how would they get this post? As for the rest of your post it is common sense. I have been capable of making it through life for many many years without the need for the government telling me how to do things as have many others. Why would I take advice from the government when they can't manage nor spend money wisely. I could go into many areas where the government is lacking from the city to the federal level. The main purpose of government is to protect the citizens but currently the government seems to think they are in the business of running our lives and making money.

5,183906949,Scott Hughes,• Hale,5 days ago,From what I read the proposed site will close December 31 and I didn't see anything about any commitment to relocate the inhabitants to at least equal accommodations. So there is the included mass forced eviction of the space on New Years Eve which would be violation of Article 25 of the UDHR. Another thing I think would be helpful is some structured organized activities available for the inhabitants like occupational therapy
6,183906949,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,5 days ago,Scott have you read how the SOS/CVC works?
7,183906949,Sue Bruner,• South Park Hill,5 days ago,Thank you Jim.

10,183906949,Dani Tyler,• Historic Montclair,5 days ago,It's not a 'near-by' children's center. The parking lot is where employees and parents park to drop off kids. The kitchen the kids eat in opens up to the parking lot as well as the gym they play in. I'm sure SOS camps are normally great and I fully support having one in the neighborhood but not at PHUMC.  Find a church that isn't also a preschool or look into one of the many unused parking lots a few blocks north just south of the highway.
11,183906949,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,5 days ago,150 churches were offered this opportunity.

I am hoping that we will show hospitality to these new residents in Park Hill during their stay here. What a good opportunity to share some of the peace that Jim speaks of that we cherish in Park Hill. Gabe, please tell us more about how to join the meetings tonight and May 1st."

22,183906949,Sharon Kermiet,• South Park Hill,4 days ago,I support PHUMC in this effort.  What they are doing is profound in the face of so much need.
23,183906949,Mary Groves,• South Park Hill,4 days ago,"My takeaway from the PHUMC presentation is this is an already established community living at the First Baptist Church downtown. It sounds like this community has already been screened and the antisocial contingent  have been screened out to a certain degree. Does that assure there won't be problems? No and there will be other homeless trying to join and some problems will occur. Does PHUMC deserve a chance to explore this community project? That's what we're exploring. Could the presentation have been more organized? Yes ,but that will come with experience. That is not what we are discussing ."

A homeless woman told me this morning that there is a laundromat at 20th and Clarkson that lets homeless people do their laundry free on Saturdays, so I think I'll go there rather than make my husband worry about the water bill.  I will accept donations for laundry detergent and Shout and I will also accept help doing the laundry if I have a lot.  Does that sound like something you can support?  I kind of hate to bring dirty wet things to your house..."

1,139471884,Sharon Duwaik,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,24 Feb,Artists are usually low-income.
2,139471884,Elizabeth Teng,• Lowry,24 Feb,Sharon Duwaik that is correct. It is also better for community and oftentimes for the art itself when they are grouped together. I do wonder how artist is being defined in this context.

14,139471884,Sharon Duwaik,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,24 Feb,"The idea of housing for Artists, is to encourage a creative component to a neighborhood.  Often an Arts community helps spur economic changes to a neighborhood.  Think of Lo-do, RiNO neighborhood, and even 5-Points.  the trick of creating an arts district is not to gentrify so much that all diverse income earners can live there."
15,139471884,Elizabeth Teng,• Lowry,24 Feb,"But the gentrification will follow anyway unfortunately. As the art historian Thomas Crow said “Artists are the Research and Development Arm of the Culture Industry.” With that said, it is so easy to change an eyesore with a little paint.  We shouldn’t keep things ugly and unused just to keep the surrounding area market cheap like the blight at 1100 Yosemite Street for example."

3,175331575,Kelsey Kistler,• East Colfax,29 Jan,I don't think so. She had her hood up so I can't say definitively.
4,175331575,Heather Mann,• Central Park,29 Jan,My friend who lives there said a woman with pink hair stole her expensive chairs off her porch.  It happened here in Stapleton too same woman took the same style chairs ... She even had the nerve to sit on the chairs first before she took them !!!!

NOT TRUE!  This is ONLY for those who get paid by the city and the state to house felons and homeless in our homes in our neighborhoods for them to profit and profit BIG TIME.  They can make up to a $1000 per felon per month in a home and if they are allowed to have five in a home then they get $5000 a month.  How is anyone trying to rent going to compete with that?

24,182347254,Ken Lipkowitz,• Central Park,5 Apr,Something like that happened to me in Arlington Virginia (an affluent suburb of Washington DC). It was a $20 in the driveway several blocks from my house. I put the bill under the windshield wiper of the car in the driveway (a Mercedes) and walked to work patting myself on the back about how honest I am. But later I realized I am well-off enough to be able to afford to do that. I am not sure what I would do if I were truly needy. Hopefully the same thing but maybe not.

34,177737993,Vivian VanArsdale,• Del Mar Parkway,20 Feb,You're right complaining distress negative things and takes you deeper into a hole so yes I am grateful for every moment I have neighbors that take care of me shovel my walk help me wake my yard bring me food if they don't hear from me check on me if my car has been out in the driveway too long without being moved I'm truly truly blessed. Monday when the high was 13 degrees I was driving my car to keep it warm and I saw a gentleman walking from King Soopers over on Mississippi possibly and going home with groceries and you can see in one of them was milk plus his heart.so of course I pulled over and asked him if I could take him home because it was so cold and I didn't want him to get frostbite and I couldn't imagine what his fingers were feeling like. Of course he accepted my offer I took him home we talked for a few minutes to let him warm up a little bit more before he had to go outside and do the cold to get into the door and we exchanged numbers. as long as it's cold I'm going to call him and see if he needs a ride so he doesn't have to walk anymore but the other day he called me and took me to lunch. Kindness generally brings back kindness and so life is great we all need to stop complaining and look at the good things . Trust me when I was younger I could walk run and do all kinds of things and now I can barely walk walking alone is such a blessing.

2,180883098,Bianca Sanchez,• Summerglenn,22 Mar,It looks like skid row. There are plenty of homeless shelters available. No one wants to be clean and sober to be able to use one. It’s no ones fault but themselves. These junkies need to get out of here
3,180883098,Sara Loveless,• Lyn Knoll,22 Mar,"Actually, there aren't enough shelters.  I work with the homeless and I can tell you for a fact that Aurora and Boulder regularly send people to Denver because they're full.  The answer isn't to keep pushing them out to different cities and counties but get involved and fight for change with your boots on the ground.  I encourage everyone to make their voice heard at the city council meeting.  Keep in mind, these ""junkies, bums, vagabonds"" or whatever derogatory term you want to use for them, are first and foremost human beings with all the faults and weaknesses as everyone else.  They were once someone's baby, child.  They are still someone's loved one, whether they know it or not.  Be the voice of change and love."

5,180883098,Jodi Garza,• Sable Altura Chambers,22 Mar,There should be trash cans there that get emptied weekly. Sadly though I see more people throwing trash out of their cars  than anything...   it's funny to say and see that the Colfax under pass is cleaner...

8,180883098,Darin Wentz,• Hoffman Heights,23 Mar,Those people are pigs and that's how they live even if there was a trash can they would still continue to throw that stuff on the ground where they sleep the city should run them out of there there are hypodermic needles all over the ground in that location those people are not concerned with the children or the people of this community and in my opinion any money spent to help them would be a waste they need to help themselves before we can help them
9,180883098,Kay Dragon,• Hoffman Heights,4w,"I agree, Darin Wentz it is a mess and they need to find someplace else to put these people. As long as people keep giving them money there, they will stay. I feel compassion for anyone out on the streets but these folks don't care. I couldn't go to the town council meeting but I am sure they have been approached with this problem and don't do anything to improve it. Off the subject but  BTW.. here is a PSA Darin did a great job cutting down some trees for me this summer. I will probably have more for you to do(edited)"
10,180883098,Nancy Brigham,• Chambers Heights,23 Mar,The trash cans would probably be used to start fires to keep them warm.  I was at the light the other night and saw a man using one of the cones to put over a fire.  The heat went through the top to warm his hands.  I don't care about how they have ended up homeless.  I care about how they will get moved.  I moved out of the hood near down town Denver.  And now it's become the Slums of Aurora.  I wish I had some empty land that I could allow them to live on.
11,180883098,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Mar,Our mayor got in by 8 votes and he's useless. He knows about this issue but he does not care. He turns both blind eyes.
0,183319453,Florence Sebern,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,13 Apr,"I have no objection to Urban Peak. According to a report last week, the City currently spends $500,000,000 (that's a half billion) on homelessness. One might wonder:"
1,183319453,Jeffrey Sturman,• City Park West,13 Apr,Over what time period? I think the city budget is $2 billion a year. I also wonder what portion of the above is federal or donated dollars.
2,183319453,Paige Burkeholder,• Southmoor Park East,4 days ago,"Jeffrey Sturman I think that article referenced City money (which some maybe Federal). Either of those are monies we put in with our hard earned dollars through taxes.  It seems that our City Council has determined they know what is best for us...and they have seemed to have forgotten that “we, the Denver residents” are THE CUSTOMER!  (As it is our money!)"
3,183319453,Ola Zak,• University Park,1w,"Urban Peak budget as stated above is $7.5 million annually for 30 minors. That is $250,000/ minor! It seems strange to call someone 24 years old a minor. That minor can  already vote and fight in a war for last 6 years. We definitely have to protect the real minors.(edited)"

0,181617442,Sophia Ramos,• Aurora Arts District,3w,This has been a business that has been around LONG before you moved here and decided to bring your notions of what is and is not “detrimental” to the area. What could help in this situation is thinking about displacing your concern into helping homeless populations and finding a middle ground with local businesses.(edited)
1,181617442,Christopher Belila,• Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,"Sophia...that's a fair point.  I don't have a right to define nice; but as a community don't we get to ask if a business is helping the community.  I'm voicing my opinion, which is nothing more than an opinion.  My concern is that public safety, and homeless community, has been an ongoing issue.  Crystal Murrillo (City Council Rep for our Ward I) has been very vocal about it.  If there are elements of the business community that contribute to the safety issue it's fair to talk about them.  If the community and the city say it's not an issue then I can except it.  "
2,181617442,Sophia Ramos,• Aurora Arts District,3w,"I appreciate your concern as well. It’s nice to see people actively trying to make our neighborhood better, but it’s also important to remember that this business and area has been the only home some people know. It is unfair to deem something as unsuitable to our neighborhood when that is subjective and a forced act of displacement. "
3,181617442,Terri Mc,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,3w,Isn't the business owner responsible for cleaning and maintaining the property? I couldn't tell from the video if there were any trash cans nearby. That would definitely help with keeping it clean if they had somewhere to throw the empties.(edited)
4,181617442,Christopher Belila,• Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,"Terri....there is a trash can.  However, they don’t clean up very often.  Also, people throw bottles across the street so it’s not their responsibility."

If you see strip clubs & porn stores as a bad element what about liquor stores like this one? great strides has been taken to clean up Colfax & places like this one will set that back. I agree that homelessness is a problem & this liquor store is only compounding that problem, it is not an asset to our community.(edited)"
6,181617442,Cassandra Martinez,• East Colfax,28 Mar,In conversation-there in the last 4 years the homeless population had grown due to a few of the non profit agencies and low income housing around the two blocks or so. From 2010-2020 there was a charter school used to be 15th Elmira where many of area kids used to attend as well as I personally volunteered and worked there for 2 years before Aurora district removed the charter school. Anyhow the from 2010-2016 it was students of all grades. 2016-2018 was high school students and 2018-2020 it was elementary /middle school only. While working there the homeless population had increased and started to create some problems. We tried to help by offering them the food that we would toss out to them. It created an few issues where they would trash the area even though there were trash cans around. We have used clean up for discipline purposes and then just regular community services for our students to learn community skills. It started to become unsafe offering them food. There would be homeless coming to our school looking for the food we were tossing. Or wait at the doors trying to come in. We had to cease donating warm meals to those in need for safety of our staff and students.😭
7,181617442,Christopher Belila,• Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,To everyone making a comment my video was to start a discussion.  If there are good solutions let’s hear them. I don’t have them.  I want us to talk and be active in our community.  The lack of activity has contributed to the area to be in decline.
8,181617442,Terri Mc,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,28 Mar,Maybe contact the city to see if they will do anything? I wonder if enough people complained they might do something about it.
9,181617442,Christopher Belila,• Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,Good idea.  We should all call and at least make an effort
10,181617442,Cassandra Martinez,• East Colfax,28 Mar,I just want to say that this is a touchy subject that can turn argumentatively but I just want to share my opinion from experiences! I hope you can find a better solution and collaborate with those in the business as well as those who are the customers of that business!
11,181617442,Christopher Belila,• Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,"Cassandra, you makes some very good points.  I have no desire to separate the community.  The Arts District is a wonderfully diverse community, and it's one that I want to see thrive.  I don't want the area to be turned into Rino or 5 Points.  "
12,181617442,Cassandra Martinez,• East Colfax,28 Mar,You are right! It should be safer for everyone. In reality I have been concern for over a decade and for the first time in over 8 years I can breath a bit with some of the clean up with the art work on the buildings as well as many new businesses and community centers around.
13,181617442,Christopher Belila,• Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,"To all those that are observing this conversation Cassandra and I are engaging in very thoughtful conversation.  This is the type of dialogue that helps a community.  This is how ideas start and change happens.  I thank Cassandra for being vocal and point out things I, or others might not consider.  "
14,181617442,Cathlene Santos,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,28 Mar,"You know Christopher, the police have a video that I gave them a couple of years ago. My husband and I went to buy a bottle of wine and I had recorded several people jumping a female and male and while waiting for police I recorded what violence goes on around there. A guy was just about to stab someone just when the police arrived. That was actually the last time I went to buy liquor there. Most of the people hanging around out there aren’t even homeless it’s become a place to panhandle people for liquor money. I’ve tried to get business and city to Inforcement no loitering and trespassing."

4,179892143,John Hand,• Central Park,14 Mar,Greetings this snowy and blustery day~!  
5,179892143,Janelle Miller,• Aurora,14 Mar,I just got a package in the mail just yesterday (which is a little late now) but contains a bunch of those heat packs for your hands- I would love to donate a bunch to the homeless if you’re out and about the next snowfall perhaps...
6,179892143,Heather MacPhail,• Montbello,16 Mar,Hand them out when your out. On most corners
7,179892143,John Hand,• Central Park,14 Mar,SURE!!!!! Just shoot me a call and so we can figure out pickup details.....720-985-6949.

0,178135964,Kim Dechant,• Historic Montclair,23 Feb,"Please return the cat you took!  Aside from being a criminal act, it is heartbreaking for the owner."
1,178135964,Kathy Davinci,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,24 Feb,"It's technically a criminal act in Aurora to let your cat roam free. Not that APD actually enforces any laws in this neighborhood, but it is illegal to let your cats, and of course dogs, outside. This story doesn't make sense. They caught her trying to steal their cat, and they still left it outside? You can't even leave a bag of trash outside in this neighborhood without it being stolen, so why would anyone leave a family member, which is what a pet is, outside at the mercy of all the bad things that could happen to a defenseless animal? This defies common sense to the point that I'm not convinced it's real."
2,178135964,Diocoles Fillenworth,• Hoffman Heights,23 Feb,"That woman has a mental issue to do that. It's one thing if the cat is homeless or in a blizzard and needs protection, but that's just crazy."
3,178135964,shannon quillian,• North Park Hill,23 Feb,Horrible. Oh I pray this women returns her cat
4,178135964,Teresa Holmes,• Locust St,23 Feb,Do you have proof that this lady stole a cat? This picture only shows a lady with a stange smile on her face.  Maybe a neighbors ring footage? Something
5,178135964,Chelsea Lavelle,• Aurora,8w,The video does not show her stealing your cat. Keep your pets inside.(edited)
6,178135964,Teresa Holmes,• Locust St,24 Feb,That's what I said.  I see a lady w a strange smile. That's it.
7,178135964,Laura M.,• Lowry,24 Feb,"Many cats love to loaf around their front/back yards. They're territorial so they rarely venture more than a 2-3 house radius from home. This lady stopped in the middle of the street, leaving her driver's side door open. It looks to me like she was looking to make a quick getaway. Who stops in the middle of the road and leaves their car door open just so they can pet a neighborhood cat? The cat looks very friendly so he was most likely pretty relaxed (ie - near his home). I'm all for keeping your pets inside but sometimes they just get out. I wouldn't judge in this case. It seems to me that clearly the owner is distressed and the images make it look like the lady was going in to abduct the cat. Didn't the OP also say the same lady had come by once before saying something like ""that's my sister's cat""?"
8,178135964,Nathalie Landeau,• Central Park,8w,My understanding is that this Woman came by twice. Allegedly the first time the owner stopped her and she left.  The second time she came over she allegedly took the cat.  The video might be of encounter #1(edited)
9,178135964,Craigers Hanzelka,• Central Park,24 Feb,Why isn't the person who owns the cat not posting herself?
10,178135964,Nathalie Landeau,• Central Park,8w,She posted on the next door app.  She is not a member of this FB group.  I am just trying to help her a bit.(edited)

0,176138781,Cassandra Martinez,• East Colfax,11w,That’s a good idea but yet might have to think this through. Sometimes the idea to solve homeless seems to be easy yet the obstacles present prevents changes.

4,176138781,Meg Ticknor,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,6 Feb,"No, these are not a tenable long term shelter- a better idea is to have auctions for them, as a fundraiser for a nonprofit you choose to partner with- money could go further this way."

1,177528991,Drew Rudolph,• East Colfax,18 Feb,Unfortunately it seems to me we need to step up our personal security as a community. 
2,177528991,Stephanie Schilken,• South Park Hill,18 Feb,We had to do the same. Our neighbors are all working together and upgrading to cover as much as possible as well. Crime is up significantly since covid.

6,177528991,Cathlene Santos,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,18 Feb,I get of work at 3am and drive home on CentralPark blvd from 48th and Havana st. The lights are brighter on that street than they are on your side streets. I’ve been trying to keep an eye for anything that might be suspicious. If I see anything I will dial 911. I live between your area and Lowery and we’re trying to get our street lights brighter. So sorry that this happened to you. Hopefully things get back to normal soon.

9,177528991,Rosalyn Price,• Northeast Park Hill,18 Feb,Not sure but a lot of homeless off Smith Rd. Using it as fuel to keep warm? Surely no one in neighborhood needing to steal gas. Omg how terrible !!
10,177528991,Nathan Slape,• Central Park,18 Feb,"I should add the Nissan guy said I was lucky I didn’t catch on fire driving up to the gas station! Be careful, if you smell gas you might want to look under your car"
11,177528991,Marty Johnson,• North Park Hill,18 Feb,My car was broken into the other day and ransacked.  Nothing was taken as far as I could see but it still irked me a lot.  There has been a lot of these type of crimes happening all over the metro area but especially in our Northeastern neighborhoods.
12,177528991,Austin Outhavong,• Bluff Lake Aurora,18 Feb,Gosh now this on top of the catalytic converter thefts. I didn’t realize garage real estate would be so valuable

15,177528991,Ann Mathews,• East Colfax,18 Feb,"People are stealing things that will help them to work- tools, trucks, plow blades, etc. They are desperate for work and money. It probably suggests the best way to get people re-employed. Give them the tools they need for self employment."

20,177528991,Nathan Slape,• Central Park,18 Feb,Thanks. It wouldn’t have been a big deal if they siphoned out every last drop but what kind of messed up people damage a car to a point it has to be towed for a couple of gallons of gas!?
21,177528991,Gloria BURNS,• East Colfax,18 Feb,"I am so sorry you are right.we do need help what hurt is the extra money to pay for all the damage that other people cause.we are not alone this is happening all over, it don't fix the problem so we have to take all the problem that our neighbors are having and try to see how we can not be a victim,can we ask the police for suggestions?please be safe and take care  (peace)"
22,177528991,Dagny Taggert,• Central Park,18 Feb,"Nathan, Be sure to report to the PD.  They apparently caught recently some who were stealing cars.  They provide more patrol when they have more reported incidents."
23,177528991,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,18 Feb,"Remember that woman who Gorilla-glued her hair to her head? I keep thinking with all the theft going on, too bad you can't coat your vehicle and its parts with Gorilla glue and let the thieves get stuck to it. Then they get to figure out a way to get unstuck before they get caught or get to spend the night stuck to the vehicle they're trying to steal or vandalize."
24,177528991,Alton Ghrist,• Northeast Park Hill,18 Feb,"I found the gas tank inlet door open one morning when I went to work, and I'd figured someone had tried to siphon gas and left the scene suddenly. remember the locking gas caps from the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973?"
25,177528991,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,9w,OMG yes! Now they have interior releases so if the thief is outside the car it’s more difficult to open the door to access the gas filler cap.

0,177668475,Catie McLane,• Adams Heights,20 Feb,"laura,  Thank you for doing this. Are you only interested in mens? I keep meaning to clean out some stuff....Larger womens clothes and some mens. I can probably work on that this week....."
1,177668475,Laura Avant,• Northeast Park Hill,20 Feb,I can definitely use the large women's clothes for Sam House and just about all the men's stuff you have or can get.  Thanks a lot.
2,177668475,Epic Cleaning,• RiNo Art District,21 Feb,Hi Laura. I own Epic Laundromat at 5115 Federal and often have clothes/towels left by customers. I would be happy to donate all that is unclaimed. We do lots of work with the community. Please private message me!
3,177668475,Laura Avant,• Northeast Park Hill,21 Feb,I would like to take the towels and clothes to the shelters after sorting them.  Let me know a good time to pick them up.  Thanks for thinking of the homeless.

0,175643330,STEVE HARLEY,• Baker,1 Feb,you’ll find that a lot of the specious claims about this amendment are carefully addressed by the documents on the city website linked above
1,175643330,David A.,• University Hills,1 Feb,"Steve, Of course. It’s their “sales brochure”.... And many valid and objective issues are very gray or not addressed at all."
2,175643330,STEVE HARLEY,• Baker,1 Feb,what issues are not addressed at all?
3,175643330,Chris P.,• Cheesman Park,1 Feb,Chapter 59 Exemptions are still barely being addressed. Pretty disappointed to see an amendment all about equity and fairness leave 20% of the city out.
4,175643330,STEVE HARLEY,• Baker,1 Feb,"the Chapter 59 issue (properties still under the ""old"" zoning code) is far more complex than this and touched every other citywide zoning change for the past ten years; that Group Living is the issue that would light a fire under Chapter 59 doesn't make a lot of sense"
5,175643330,Chris Metzger,• Mar Lee,11w,For the rest of the story:
6,175643330,Matt Fritz-Mauer,• Wash Park West,2 Feb,"The Safe and Sound group has been the worst aspect of all of this. Their ""Meet Your New Neighbors"" propaganda video was just disgusting, a grotesque misrepresentation of every aspect of this. "
7,175643330,STEVE HARLEY,• Baker,1 Feb,"here's today's Denver Post editorial in support of the amendment; it's a good, brief summary of the issues:"
8,175643330,Paige Burkeholder,• Southmoor Park East,1 Feb,And here is a very thorough discussion by the Denver Gazette that has been following this story much more closely:  https://denvergazette.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-group-living-all-harm-no-good/article_bd6ea004-5c68-11eb-81f7-dbc3cc08a6af.html
9,175643330,Carolyn Haas,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,1 Feb,If this amendment and it’s effect were so well addressed that why did a citizen have to go through the courts to get 48 public documents about this amendment? Just saying this mayor and the city Council don’t always have your best interest in mind. My personal opinion.
10,175643330,KR C.,• Mar Lee,1 Feb,Thank you and agreed.  They don’t have the public’s best interest in mind on this one.  They did go through the courts and documents and information was hidden from the public. Check safeandsounddenver.com
11,175643330,Matt C.,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,11w,"There are essentially two major concerns of the opposition. Fear of other people, and a desire to maintain property values. Neither is a good look ""politically"" speaking, so they have to launder their position so as not to look selfish or discriminatory. "
12,175643330,Matt C.,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,2 Feb,"Tonia Wilson Ah yes, the ""I know you are, but what am I"" defense. Conjecture does not = facts, and nothing of any substance has been ""uncovered""."
13,175643330,Teresa G.,• Cook Park,1 Feb,"I am most grateful to the extensive research conducted, and advocacy offered, by members of the Safe and Sound group, as well as to members of various RNOs, a few Denver City Council members, thousands of Denver residents, and other stakeholders for expressing opposition to the original Group Living text amendments. Without the research, advocacy, and voiced opposition, the Group Living text amendments would not have undergone revisions in December 2020 that make them a bit more reasonable in their current form. Regardless of how one perceives the tone of the Safe and Sound site, and regardless of how one considers the Group Living text amendments in their current and revised form, the long-term  effects of the proposed text amendments remain to be seen on the increase of housing availability while decreasing housing costs, decreasing gentrification, minimizing neighborhood density, and creating equity in the availability of resources across all parts of the City and County of Denver."

20,175643330,Paul B.,• Capitol Hill Central,3 Feb,I don't understand your claim. 
21,175643330,Paige Burkeholder,• Southmoor Park East,11w,"Matt Cordon Chapter 59 was not disclosed by the City or CPD; 311 and pocket gov photos submitted by residents were not able to be viewed by inspectors was recently uncovered by people in SSD (and is now maybe fixed by CPD); the many special interests and limited # of residents w/ lack of diversity on GLAC was further disclosed by Denver neighbors; that this is a housing issue not a race issue; the list of hundreds of violations in NE Denver that cant seem to ever get resolved leading to lack of confidence in ZNIS with these proposed zoning changes; the significant number of police calls/cars to CC facilities and a youth rehabilitation/detention center....just to name a few.  Many Denver neighbors across the city, all of different ages, backgrounds, ethnicities, income and political affiliations worked across the City to bring specific and detailed information out about this massive zoning code change.  Because the City didn’t. There should have been more public discussion on this...which is hard to do due to limitations in gatherings during a pandemic. And yes, it should have been on the ballot.(edited)"
22,175643330,Luchia B.,• Baker,2 Feb,"The Baker Historic Neighborhood Association, a Denver RNO, fully supports the GLA. In fact, it's a shame it was watered down so much."
23,175643330,Paige Burkeholder,• Southmoor Park East,2 Feb,Here is a list of neighbors that oppose the GLA.
24,175643330,Michelle B.,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,2 Feb,"Honest question for those that know: It occurred to me that our wealthiest neighborhoods probably aren't at any risk of being over-run by group homes as the cost to rent these homes would still be astronomical given the amount that would have to be paid.  I also find it hard to believe that a proprietor of group-living homes would look there first for the same reason.  Those homes are just too expensive to reasonably locate a group-home/transitional home in them.  Has this proven true in the cities that have enacted this type of rule?  So, really, this falls to the middle class and poorer neighborhoods to absorb this .... as they do for everything else.  In principal, I'm in favor of this.  Allowing 4 unrelated adults to split a 3 or 4 bedroom home makes so much sense in this housing market. And, if they can afford it - who are we to say they can't?  But, I'm not a fan of pushing this through without addressing the Chapter 59 issue (it defies any attempt to be equitable).  That makes the whole thing sketchy in my opinion."
25,175643330,Teresa G.,• Cook Park,2 Feb,"Hi, Michelle, Excellent observation and point! This is exactly what Pam Jiner, according to Luchia B.’s post, my “one black friend,” referenced in this article:"
26,175643330,Barbara Lencicki,• Wash Park West,2 Feb,"Exactly. The Chapter 59 conundrum- the 20 % of the city which will not be affected by any of this, those two districts are not even in the wealthiest parts of the city .  Mayor Hancock, coincidentally, happens to live in one of them!"
27,175643330,Florence Sebern,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,2 Feb,"Link to the court docs regarding the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) request to the Mayor's office that was denied, challenged, and WON. 97% of the denied documents were court ordered to be released. This Amendment was cooked up by the Mayor, two at-large councilpersons, and providers of services. The hidden objectives were 1) increase community corrections, 2) increase homeless shelters, 3) increase density in single family neighborhoods because of the City's failed efforts with community corrections-homeless shelters-affordable housing. This is a direct transfer of those failures to hard-working, tax-paying, stable Denverites."
28,175643330,Matt C.,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,2 Feb,One of your spokespeople told me to ask you if you're going to file a follow up lawsuit with all the  evidence of impropriety and dirty dealings your first suit uprooted?

16,173136067,Nancy Ulrich,• Hilltop,9 Jan,You can also turn it inside out and have the outside made into a rain coat. Then you could wear it and no one would know it was fur!

I will lighten one of the bags I have to make it possible to carry and leave one for you on the front porch.  I can also leave the holographic puzzle we were too blind to do and hope you have an easier one to trade for a while.  I'm sorry I won't be here in the morning due to the laundry, but if you come by before 1:00 or between 3:30 and 5:00, I won't be on a phone bank or watching the release of Pres. Obama's new book.

1,181171793,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,24 Mar,I found my last car on Denver Craigslist and I highly recommend spending $125 to have Automotive MDs look it over.

They’ve checked my last 3 purchases and I’ve never had a single issue that I didn’t know about when I bought the vehicle.

22,181171793,Colin Hooper,• East Colfax,24 Mar,Absolutely what kind of bike is it? Or what size?
23,181171793,Helo Wonderful,• East Colfax,4w,Colin Hooper it’s a 26” women’s bike. Tbh it was given to me by my husband and I have not been able to use it. So if it works I can leave it for you outside this weekend. Obviously we will coordinate time. I am just super sketch about COVID so it would be a no contact thing. Lmk if it would work for you. It’s a Schwinn blue and white.(edited)
24,181171793,Gretchen Koehler,• Mayfair,24 Mar,Colin I PM'd you the details on the car I wrote you about earlier.  They do still have it all fixed up and it is in your price range.
25,181171793,Arthur Louis,• South Hilltop,26 Mar,Colin. With the pandemic used cars are at a premium and new cars are sitting on the dealers lots. Most car buyers do not want to or can't afford to buy a new car. Best of luck and remember buyer beware

And the cops dropped her off, very unusual maybe she's a confidential informant possibly keeping an eye on somebody in your neighborhood that could potentially be a bigger worry.(edited)"
5,172797351,Kelly Petersen,• Congress Park,15w,"Other than that she's probably just homeless lives in her truck and doesn't have a better part of town to park at the moment, or possibly out of fuel those big box trucks guzzle gasoline. I would think people that are thieves or criminals would not stay in one spot where they can be seen by the same people over and over again.

I know of this because I have a close family member with a meth addiction. They too hang out in their car for hours and hours and even live out of it sometimes months on end. Unfortunately it’s the life many drug addicts like and choose over sobriety and a warm home. Best of luck to you guys with this situation 🙏✨"
12,172797351,Lisa Cherry,• South Park Hill,5 Jan,Thank you for the information. I appreciate you taking the time to share your perspective.
13,172797351,Karla Alva,• Hale,5 Jan,In the meantime- I would go out and get a wind chime and/or a multi faceted crystal that you can hang in their general direction to block the negative chi you are experiencing coming from their direction. I would hang the wind chimes or bells from the cable dish or anywhere outside the sound won’t be obstructed- and far enough from your bedroom windows. Then I would hang the crystal in the window on the inside of  home. Simple Feng Shui at your service!
14,172797351,Chad Angell,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Jan,Since you are the one who called the cops can’t you call them and ask what they did or are doing about the warrant? And why they let her stay there? Just curious
15,172797351,Lisa Cherry,• South Park Hill,6 Jan,"I called back and the information they provided was that they investigated the situation, she wasn’t a threat, and that I could not take further action until they were outside for more than 72 hours"

19,172797351,Gretchen Koehler,• Mayfair,15w,"That is kind of obvious.  It doesn't mean that we have to accept homeless people who ""may be mentally ill"" possibly leaving needles, excrement or bothering people who live in a nice neighborhood.  Seriously,  what if the issue becomes so great that we have homeless people living in cars up and down neighborhood blocks.  Are you going to say we should just accept it because poor them?  I have helped the homeless on many occasions.  Believe me some of them want help.  Many do not.  They understand how to live on the streets and they are truly comfortable with the lifestyle.   The drug addicts just want their next ""fix"" and will do whatever it takes to get it.  Lisa good luck in helping the woman move along.  For any of you that are concerned about the woman's welfare, don't insult Lisa by patronizing her.  Here's an idea, go find the box truck and offer her a ride to the methadone clinic or to get registered with Denver Health and Human Services.  There is a place right on Colfax just east of Colorado on the Northside of the street that you can take her to get some help.(edited)"

From park hill Facebook page:  Montview Presbyterian Church has a Mitten Tree and Coat Drive every year for new and gently used items. Kids coats and warm items will go to Hallett Academy in Park Hill; adult items will go to programs for men and women experiencing homelessness.

Even though children don't live on the streets, we have a need for children's clothes and toys for a low-income housing complex where my manager lives.  There are a lot of families affected by COVID who can't afford to buy what they need or want.  They pick things up from her and leave donations in her ""love box"" in return.  We did give gifts to homeless parents who might see their kids over the holidays so they would have a gift to give and to homeless kids outside Urban Peak.  I just sent a box and 2 bags of clothes and 3 bags of toys home with her to share today.    We will go to the homeless camps this weekend so I can give her more and the big  suitcases and packs then.  Are you able to come to 3556 Fairfax St.?

If in the future you have something to give to those who have no homes and very little shelter this winter, Resurrection Clothing is going to the homeless camps several times a week with clothing, toiletries, toys for the kids of homeless parents, etc.  I can pick up if you live in the northeast and get it all out to the homeless within a week.

0,175188272,Paulette Shalhoub,• Sloans/Highlands,29 Jan,"This is great news.  Now, how about putting laundry and shower facilities in all junior high and high schools for homeless students?  It is demoralizing for anyone, especially teens, to feel dirty and have to wear dirty clothes.  How wonderful it would be if the schools provided washers and dryers and a small shower stall to help these kids who are poor and/or homeless through absolutely no fault of their own.  This show of caring might help to keep students on the edge in school."

1,180006053,Lisa Haldeman,• Historic Montclair,14 Mar,No clue. I know there have been 2 cars stolen within blocks of our house (one on the other side of the school and one on 11th) as well as other auto break-ins.  Maybe we’re a good target because there is a school across the street so we only have two direct neighbors/potential witnesses??
2,180006053,Jan Beck,• Historic Montclair,14 Mar,"Lisa Haldeman Lisa very valid. Really sorry that this has happened to you, I live a few blocks away from you."
3,180006053,Kathy Sudmeier,• Historic Montclair,14 Mar,Sorry to hear that.   Makes no sense.  I don’t think anyone keeps valuables in a glove box.   Hopefully they are not looking for registrations and proof of insurance with identifying information.  Or I have heard they are seeking garage door openers to access garage .   I leave nothing but an owners manual and an old fashioned map of  Colorado!

I am with Resurrection Clothing (see above post).  We may get some tomorrow but not many and I'm waiting for Coats for Colorado to process my application.  Meanwhile, there are thousands of homeless people out there from climates that don't prepare them for a long cold winter.  May we have them?  Message me and I'll arrange to pick them up.

We commented pn the beautiful wheels but she did not respond.  A man pulled up in a white Hyundai Tucson and I think they were planning to load your bike into the car but we did not stare at them.  So Sorry.  We should have gotten a plate # or a photo but it was only after a half a minute that we realized the whole scene was fishy.  Having been victim of a theft a few months ago and understanding as cyclists how those bikes were very meaningful, we are truly sorry.  Are you in the house with a newer Mustang in the driveway facing Montclair School?  If so, the garage door had been opened and was open as we walked through the alley."

17,174707662,Moises Valdez,• Historic Montclair,23 Jan,This is my work truck
18,174707662,Erik Peterson,• Mayfair,23 Jan,So sorry to hear that.  Will keep an eye out.
19,174707662,Jerry Hashi,• Historic Montclair,23 Jan,Sorry this happened. Will keep an eye out too.
20,174707662,Kari Rutter,• South Park Hill,24 Jan,"Hit the pawn shops, that happened to us and within 2 hours we got a call that our bike showed up.  It was a mess but worth it to get it back."
21,174707662,Aszur Rollins,• Historic Montclair,24 Jan,"Great idea, thanks"
22,174707662,Nancy DuPree,• Historic Montclair,24 Jan,I am so sorry this happened to you both. Hope you can recoup your things. Glad you both were not hurt physically.
23,174707662,Lisa Haldeman,• Historic Montclair,24 Jan,"So sorry to hear this happened to you. We live on the other side of the school, but were watching football so we didn't  see anything. Thanks for letting all of us know to be on alert."
24,174707662,Nikki Shears,• Hilltop,25 Jan,SO very sorry!  Will keep eyes peeled.
25,174707662,Walker Dimmig,• Historic Montclair,25 Jan,Same car involved in another incident in the neighborhood this morning: https://nextdoor.com/news_feed/?post=174868982
26,174707662,Norman Wilson,• South Park Hill,28 Jan,Your bike may also be in one of the homeless camps downtown. One guy bought his bike back from a bike thief at a camp downtown. Be careful. See Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman's experience recently in the Post.
27,174707662,Aszur Rollins,• Historic Montclair,5 Feb,They found our vehicle. I don’t have any particulars but it’s with the Denver police getting printed. Hopefully we get something from that
0,178677668,Daniel Webb,• Lowry,1 Mar,"I’m with you.   We should try to organize this so that we have coverage without 2 or 3 people having to give up their nights.   It really shouldn’t be hard to catch these guys, and my feeling is that it’s not a ton of people doing it"
1,178677668,Krys Rodgers,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,Be careful...
2,178677668,Daniel Webb,• Lowry,1 Mar,"At some point, and this has been true throughout history, people have to take on some risk to get things “as they should be”.   This is wayyyy beyond out of control and no one is going to help us.   "
3,178677668,Brown Keener,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,Daniel Webb I agree. These punks don’t want confrontation. If they see someone standing there every corner they turn they’ll eventually figure out they better go somewhere else.
4,178677668,William Davis jr,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,I'm in! Me and my Pitbull (gracy) happen to enjoy late night walks. I'm unemployed rite now and I'm a night owl. With all the shootings lately we haven't been going on walks around here but that can change. I'd love to help anyway I can. My truck had 17 gallons of gas siphoned from it. Me being unemployed that really put a damper in my day when I left to go to the store to get food and couldn't because I had no gas to do it. I too am at my wits end dealing with these thugs! gauranteed
5,178677668,Nathan Slape,• Central Park,2 Mar,Be thankful they only siphoned the gas. Some fool actually cut the large fuel line going into my gas tank. It cost me 419.00 for them to get 5.00 worth of gas
6,178677668,Cathlene Santos,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,"We did just that on my block and several of us walked to both corners, and there is not just 1 person outside hanging around. I suggest something loud like those air horn’s. You know the one’s in the cans, you could hear them pretty far, and it also helps to make a map of the houses on both sides of your street and both sides of your alley and share phone numbers of the neighbors that want to contact or be contacted if needed to let them know about unwanted people on their properties. The horn would scare the hell out of them and wake people. Especially if you’re not far from Colfax"
7,178677668,Daniel Webb,• Lowry,1 Mar,Great idea
8,178677668,William Davis jr,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,I'll make it a point to walk gracy later today. I'll give a heads up on here before I do. If you see us give a wave and I'll do the same. Cops aren't looking out for us so we have to do it for ourselves. Hope everyone has a safe day.
9,178677668,Brown Keener,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,"Thank you sir, you have a great day too!"
10,178677668,Brown Keener,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,I love the air horn idea. That will get everyone’s attention. Great deterrent!

12,178677668,Don Schooley,• Aurora Arts District,1 Mar,Longtime fellow sheepdog here. Always pay close attention. Relentlessly vigilant.
13,178677668,William Davis jr,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,That's me to a tee. Some people consider me peronoid. Call it what you want if there is something going on I'm gonna know it. My dog is a good judge if there is something out of place. She know good people and she know bad people and she knows the difference.
14,178677668,Karina Lopez,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,"Thank you Brown Keener and everyone else that is willing to be on the lookout. I have lived in this area for 20 years and am saddened by the increase in crime. This area did get cleaned up a few years back when all the new construction started happening, but that did not last. Covid and the homeless camps haven't helped. I am seriously considering moving 😔"
15,178677668,Don Schooley,• Aurora Arts District,1 Mar,Me too. I belong in a rural setting.
16,178677668,Veronica Barahona - Ziegler,• Central Park,1 Mar,I get it but this idiots have guns. Do you want to risk your life? We worked hard for the things we worked for and it's unfair for an idiot to just come and take it. But is it worth your life?
17,178677668,Don Schooley,• Aurora Arts District,1 Mar,Yes. And yes. Sheepdogs are not helpless.
18,178677668,Veronica Barahona - Ziegler,• Central Park,1 Mar,I don't think it's about being helpless. It's about what is more important your family or your material things.
19,178677668,Brown Keener,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,1 Mar,"I’m trained and still train, martial arts and weapons. I’m not looking for a fight, but Lord help anyone who attacks me. I won’t be bullied or stand by and watch, sorry it’s just not in my nature."
20,178677668,Don Schooley,• Aurora Arts District,1 Mar,Maybe they'll catch on.
21,178677668,Rocki Rosenbach,• East Colfax,1 Mar,Please be careful they may have a gun :(
22,178677668,Don Schooley,• Aurora Arts District,7w,"So? Oh, you're talking to the criminals. I agree. Yes, criminals, be careful. They may have a gun.(edited)"
23,178677668,Rocki Rosenbach,• East Colfax,1 Mar,JUST SAYING  !!!! Sorry
24,178677668,Don Schooley,• Aurora Arts District,1 Mar,Nothing to be sorry about. We don't want to shoot them. Their choice. Bad career path. They knew that when they signed up.
25,178677668,Patrick Mann,• Central Park,1 Mar,I totally agree.  If we don’t stand up it will only get worse.  Much worse.
26,178677668,Kathy Davinci,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,RIGHT ON! 👍🏻👏🏻
27,178677668,William Davis jr,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,Dash cams and ring doorbells are very useful tools as well. Amagine if every person on your block had a ring doorbell.
28,178677668,Mj Foster,• Central Park,7w,"Most thieves don’t care if there face is seen, most burglaries never get solved, even with a face, they know this, burglaries that had a face where never solved as they are such low profile crimes, so cops don’t put out pictures of thieves, and because most are not registered in some system that already has their face, or even if they are cops use those systems to search for more important cases, if you get a picture of a crook, chances are it doesn’t matter because the cops can’t, or don’t have the time to match a name or an address to a face(edited)"
29,178677668,Don Harris,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,"Thank you very much, Brown Keener, for your concern and ""pro-activism!"" Please be careful and stay well."
30,178677668,Gloria BURNS,• East Colfax,1 Mar,"I  do under stand how you feel before you do that is your life worth it? so why don't you come up with another plan it's to bad that radio shack is gone but you can get flood light at all four corners of your house, but you will have to get with the neighbors.i had a neighbor many years ago he had his house rig for this kind of problem.going from house to house and getting idea can also help please don't go out there at night you might not die but get hurt to the point where you can't do any thing for your self i hope you under stand what i am trying to say did you ask the police for suggestion? also what i got from consumer report if your yard look like no one care there is more of a chance of people breaking in maybe when we are free from covid we can figure something out.but please please don't go out i love you and i never met you.(peace)"
31,178677668,Don Harris,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1 Mar,"Brown Keener, I concur with Gloria Burns. Please do not put your life at risk. Your family and friends value your life too much to have it put in jeopardy over this nonsense. Thanks again for caring and your willingness to bravely serve your community."
32,178677668,Mj Foster,• Central Park,1 Mar,"You think they are all connected? How will word spread? Honestly just don’t keep stuff you don’t want stolen in places that are easy to get to, install a kill switch in your car if your worried about getting it stolen, costs like $30 and is easy to do, I can almost guarantee that the thieves are not all talking to each other, you won’t scare them away, just do stuff that makes you less of a target"
33,178677668,Terri Mcknight,• Del Mar Parkway,1 Mar,Mj I think is right. Last fall I had a friend visiting. Her jeep was parked in my drive. My room mate was in his car in the drive. He was leaving. When all of a sudden her jeep is backing out of the driveway !!. We reviewed security footage. The beef pulled up on the side street you could see him walk in front of the vehicle that dropped him off you could see his shadow crossed in front of the car walked up the sidewalk to my driveway from the time he hit the vehicle till the time he was pulling out of my driveway it was 4 seconds 4 seconds that's so fast I was in shock. So anything to delay them or deter them make them have to stay around longer will most likely stop them.
34,178677668,Gloria BURNS,• East Colfax,1 Mar,"I was just thinking the same thing Don we can do that or put on the car alarm if only at night the market for car alarm is out there let's search for something we all can afford and easy to install. i will try to look this week.I know together we can trim it down, let's do this (peace)"
0,170770370,Kate Green-Mularski,• Locust St,14 Dec,My kids and I volunteer at the local food bank and collect items and make crochet hats for the homeless in our area and when we can make burritos on the weekends and deliver them to the homeless campers.

I haven't been able to get in contact with you, however.  Since I can only go out on Thursday and Friday due to a COVID test on Sat and double quarantining until surgery, could I ask if I could meet you somewhere to pick it up?  If you can call me at 303-316-6748 I will arrange something.  My colleague, Mona, will be going downtown on Friday evening to give out clothes, gifts, etc.  She is younger and more gutsy.  Thank you for your concern and generosity."

0,173030450,Anna McCaffery,• Congress Park,8 Jan,Everything in this documentary is against the law now so I am not sure what your point is. Anyone can live anywhere. Seems like you are trying to ease some guilt that might best be done in confession or some other personal place.

4,173030450,Anna Noble,• Central Park,9 Jan,"I disagree. Segregation is alive and well most everywhere.

0,168583651,Maria Draco,• Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,It's private property. It won't happen.  And as a resident who lives on the adjacent community - hell to the no.
1,168583651,Laura Leckband,• Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,Why? The property is huge. How does it affect you more than the people already roaming the area? To be clear / I am only 2 blocks from the entry.
2,168583651,Shawn Torres,• Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,No thanks we have enough to worry about. They should do brighton fields there
3,168583651,Laura Leckband,• Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,Which is what?
4,168583651,Shawn Torres,• Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,As far as crime and unwanted visitors on people's property there's enough around already. You can't say there will be zero crime associated with the move or area. Especially the middle of neighborhoods.
5,168583651,Laura Leckband,• Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,"Jill Christensen I have worked with the homeless in multiple cities. That is exactly why I suggest a secure area which can be monitored, humane and sanitary."
6,168583651,Nicole S.,• Five Points North,23 Nov,Jill Christensen There are no services in Byers.
7,168583651,Kaila L.,• Five Points,22 Nov,"How does this help find homeless jobs, homes & figure out a sustainable life?"
8,168583651,Laura Leckband,• Northeast Park Hill,22 Nov,First - it helps keep them alive. Second - have you ever interviewed for a job without any address? The problems are much more complex than just just “get a job”. Some cannot work without dealing with other issues first. Some are veterans with serious issues that prevent them from working. As for sustainability - if you are spending all your time just moving from place to place and trying to eat. You don’t have time to figure out how to build a life. Putting people in a secure place where they can access services is the first step.

10,168583651,Cristy Davis,• Northeast Park Hill,23 Nov,"This is the program in the cap hill area, it’s called safe outdoor spaces.  Read about it!"
11,168583651,Laura Leckband,• Northeast Park Hill,23 Nov,Cristy Davis thank you. That is exactly it.
12,168583651,Moises Alvelo,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Nov,ohhh this is going to be a good one!!!!
13,168583651,Karla Alva,• Hale,23 Nov,I would invest into an apartment building complex for homelessness. One year free rent to get on your feet. Property paid for with tax dollars. Utilities paid for by occupant to also help build up their credit.
14,168583651,Laura Leckband,• Northeast Park Hill,24 Nov,"The issue is - where would you locate it? The same people who fight a temporary encampment would fight harder to prevent permanent buildings. So you end up creating “projects” - something that has already proven to be a failure. I think the real solution is a version of PadSplit, which would be supported by the group housing ordinance currently under consideration (in its original form). Small groups or families scattered throughout communities where they are invested in the neighborhood and can support each other."
15,168583651,Marlissa Netzel,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Nov,There alot of field off of i70 or Smith Road
16,168583651,Laura Leckband,• Northeast Park Hill,24 Nov,Yes - and it is close to Denver rescue mission. The value of the golf course is that the infrastructure is already there.
17,168583651,Zach Daniels,• Hoffman Heights,24 Nov,Yeah.... no
18,168583651,Quinton Feast,• North Park Hill,24 Nov,Why not?
19,168583651,Zach Daniels,• Hoffman Heights,24 Nov,"A. I think you should join me on the podcast because this is a great topic. B. Instead of using prisoners for slave labor wages we should take public jobs (cleaning up state parks etc) and use that for homeless so they have a job and can learn some skills/ eventually parse them out to private companies that may be able to pay more. ""Rent"" will.be deducted from pay and then won't be coming put of my tax dollars without any value add"
20,168583651,Laura Leckband,• Northeast Park Hill,24 Nov,"That is an idea that has worked before. However, in order for it to work again we have to be willing to invest in those people, some of whom are honestly too damaged or too old to do the work you are suggesting. The investment must include room, board, and training, as it did before."
21,168583651,Daria M.,• Sunnyside,29 Nov,"So what keeps homeless from committing a crime, going to jail, and having a dry place to sleep, 3 meals a day, and clothes to wear? I don’t see prison work as slavery, many enjoy being able to be productive and outside.  We always s have work to do in our city though so a program like you suggest would be wonderful!"
22,168583651,Joe B.,• Ballpark,24 Nov,The greatest factor in ending homelessness is employment.  Open up businesses please so they can hire.
23,168583651,Laura Leckband,• Northeast Park Hill,24 Nov,They will - as soon as people start behaving responsibly so others stop dying.
24,168583651,Jennifer Dillon,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,26 Nov,"There's the mother of all homeless encampment sweeps happening on Monday in Denver -- 300 people. The police have been directing people at all of their previous sweeps this summer and fall to go to this camp, and now they're going to scatter these folks to the 4 winds in the middle of a pandemic, right after Thanksgiving weekend. Anyone who is interested is needed for support. Support may mean food distribution, helping folks pack if needed/able, moving belongings, or just physically being there in solidarity. They will need 4x the amount of food and coffee and hands on deck as a typical sweep, so if you can't attend personally because you are working and wanted to contribute financially you can donate to Denver Homeless Out Loud."
25,168583651,Laura Leckband,• Northeast Park Hill,29 Nov,That is bad. It solves absolutely nothing.
26,168583651,Laura Avant,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Dec,"Laura Leckband One thing it does though is show everyone how callous and uncaring our mayor and city council are.  Even after a protracted lawsuit, they continue to roust the homeless using the   public health ruse, take anything they can't take with them, and disperse them to ""nowhere"" where their helpers can't even find them to help them get into housing.  to make them crowd together to pack up and move then find another place to crowd together again will increase COVID-19 exposure as well.  This truly does not solve anything.  Shame on that lying Hancock of the ""sanctioned camps""."
27,168583651,Christine O'Connell,• City Park,20w,"This makes me sad.  It's COLD. I mean, I'm cold in my house tonight and I have 4 walls and a roof (and heat, sort of). And this will only have space for 30 women.  I know, it's a start, but everytime I drive by that abandoned Royal hotel on Colfax and Colorado I think why can't the city just buy that, fix it up and get a Housing First plan up and running. I would think it would be more efficient to provide services if people were housed -- getting them clothes, food, therapy meetings.  I know, some people have mental health issues where they can't be inside, but really how many want to live in tents in freezing temps.  Call me whimpy.(edited)"
28,168583651,David Martin,• Northeast Park Hill,2 Dec,far better idea than turning the PHGC land into some outdoor campsite.  I've long thought that old motel could be refurbished or a better use...the land beneath it is likely worth  far more than the building and that's why it sits empty as an eyesore.
29,168583651,Sadie Martin,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Dec,The amount of *white* privileged people in this thread is disgusting... You all should be ASHAMED. I lived right across the street from the St. Francis shelter for 18 MONTHS and NEVER experienced ANY problems!!! The homeless individuals keep to themselves! They aren’t trying to cause trouble!
30,168583651,Shirelle Guzman,• Adams City,6 Dec,It's just overall sad. Who chooses to be homeless? Something has to really be wrong to just accept to live like that. Either way the people need help.
31,168583651,Laura Avant,• Northeast Park Hill,6 Dec,"I totally agree.  After working with Denver's street homeless every week for over 9 years and getting to know a lot of them, I have been challenged to answer why some of them seem to want to remain outside when given the chance of a shelter stay.  Then when I went to Jerry Burton's trial for violating the Urban Camping Ban when the judge considered the constitutionality of forcing people to go to shelters as an alternative to arrest, I learned a lot.  Some people have health problems that prevent them from sleeping all night (they can't just get up and sit or watch tv); others can't tolerate crowds due to PTSD; others have other mental health conditions that they can't express in shelters; some work late and can't get to a shelter in time before lockup; others have partners, children or pets that can't stay with them; and others do not trust the workers in the shelters to protect them or their belongings as they sleep.  "
32,168583651,Jessica Warren,• Clayton,7 Dec,The single homeless people need more resources. I know personally how much help there is for homeless families. I am thankful for the help my family has gotten but with as much abandoned building and open land they could do more to help the people who don't have children.
33,168583651,Jessica Dempsey,• Northeast Park Hill,6 Dec,"Are you high?  What an insane suggestion! No thanks, move along."
34,168583651,Laura Avant,• Northeast Park Hill,6 Dec,"I will gladly move along from someone who is unwilling to learn or consider the plight of other people.  No, not insane, just principled."

4,172018238,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,16w,Look at the shelters.  Post on lost and found pets Facebook. You’ll find her.  Someone is taking care of her.  😢(edited)
5,172018238,Christina Sloan,• Northeast Park Hill,28 Dec,There is a ‘Chinese Sharpei’ that was picked up by Denver animal shelter just now - no photo yet... hoping it’s her!!!
6,172018238,Christina Sloan,• Northeast Park Hill,28 Dec,Not her :(
7,172018238,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,16w,Does she have a collar? Chip? There are many resources on the Denver Animal Shelter Website. Try calling them.  You are close to Parkhill Golf course could of gotten disoriented.  Hope she comes home today!(edited)
8,172018238,Christina Sloan,• Northeast Park Hill,28 Dec,She has a collar with tags - she was going in for surgery this week where she was getting her chip :(
9,172018238,Marie Salame,• South Park Hill,28 Dec,I love chows 🙏 please let us know if/when you find her
10,172018238,Christina Sloan,• Northeast Park Hill,29 Dec,Please keep your eyes out - not one single sighting yet. Still out looking.
11,172018238,Jonell Herndon,• Central Park,29 Dec,You should go take a flyer to the homeless camps on Smith Rd. They might have seen something and are out a lot.
12,172018238,Christina Sloan,• Northeast Park Hill,29 Dec,Thank you. Great idea- will do!
13,172018238,Ed Munoz,• Northeast Park Hill,29 Dec,There’s a female chow mix at Dumb Friends but she looks a little too brown but may be just the lighting? Worth a look.
14,172018238,Christina Sloan,• Northeast Park Hill,29 Dec,Thank you- I called them and that gal was actual an owner turn in. I was hoping it was her with bad lighting! My girl also has a bad leg - and that one does not - but thank you so so so much.
15,172018238,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,16w,On the Denver Animal website you can register and it will go to all shelters listed. Worth a try.  Still praying for your reunification.(edited)
16,172018238,Tatiana Masterson,• Central Park,30 Dec,I’m sorry you are going through this. Here is some advice I found on another post:
17,172018238,Christina Sloan,• Northeast Park Hill,31 Dec,Daphne is still missing! Please keep an eye out - if we can get sightings we can set a trap
18,172018238,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,31 Dec,Darn!  She may not know her way hack home.  Hope she makes it home tonight.
19,172018238,Ann Burke,• South Park Hill,3 Jan,"Guys- someone took down all of the LOST DOG- Daphne posters. According to the professional dog trackers involved, these paper posters are the best bet to locate the area sweet Mama Daphne has been calling home base. Please keep posters up! They are there to help find a great dog who deserves a chance at a great life. Please keep an eye out for anyone taking LOST DAPHNE CHOW signs down. All signs will be taken down by volunteers as soon as she is recovered. Thanks and Happy New Year!"

16,172725919,Robin Black,• East Colfax,5 Jan,"Did they charge you $70? My roommates German Shepherd jumped the fence in the backyard when she first moved in. He had all his tags and was chipped. Someone took him to ddfl and the first thing they did was give him a rabies vaccine, in spite of the fact he was wearing a valid rabies tag and they charged my roommate $70 to get him back. 😢😢"

1,175926741,Jordan Conant,• Historic Montclair,4 Feb,I have a decent amount of work shirts that I could donate. I’m a painter so they do have dried paint on them. Is that okay?
2,175926741,Melly Kinnard,• Lowry,4 Feb,That is very kind of you but they are tryng to give the men clothing that is as nice as possible.  Things that can't be reused can be taken to ARC.  I hear they raise money though pounds of goods if they can't sell things.
3,175926741,Jordan Conant,• Historic Montclair,4 Feb,"Ok. I’ll go through my closet and anything I haven’t worn in the last year that isn’t covered in paint, I’ll box up and drop off at your garage tomorrow. Appreciate what you’re doing!"

22,175926741,Melly Kinnard,• Lowry,5 Feb,Underwear is needed more because people donate socks more often.  Thank you!

0,175492846,Lindsay Meyer,• Historic Montclair,31 Jan,Hope your pup is ok!!!!
1,175492846,Kathy Malone,• Historic Montclair,31 Jan,That is scary.  I also hope your pup is ok.
2,175492846,Tiffany Silverberg,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,31 Jan,"I saw an off leash pitbull yesterday, too, but does not match your description at all. The man looked homeless and the dog looked like she had just had puppies. He was outside of the dog park in Lowry. Made me sad and wary at the same time."
3,175492846,Katherine Freeman,• Congress Park,31 Jan,I am so sorry to hear that this happened to you!  Was the owner male or female?
4,175492846,Stephanie Jackson,• Lowry,31 Jan,"I agree that is scary and illegal to have an off leash dog in Denver. I also thought pitbulls were not allowed in Denver. I hope your doggie is okay. That is horrible. I used to walk my little doggies there when I lived on Uinta. I still live in Lowry, but don’t walk my current doggies there. Ugh! Some people don’t follow rules or care about others - very sad."
5,175492846,Kyra Frank,• South Park Hill,31 Jan,They are legal in Denver and most surrounding areas now
6,175492846,Terri Teeuws,• Congress Park,31 Jan,Scary...you have to pick up your dog and a risk that the dog comes after you!  Owner took off...WTH
7,175492846,Mary Mathews,• Lowry,31 Jan,Voters in Denver approved an amendment in November to now allow pit bulls in Denver. All pit bulls living in the city and county of Denver are supposed to be registered. What a joke. I’m so sorry this happened to your dog and to you. I have had to pick up my dog as well a couple of times to avoid him being attacked by an off leash dog.
8,175492846,Michele DB,• Lowry,31 Jan,It seems leashing is an option. 🙄 Love when people think rules don’t apply to them. Super sad. And possibly very scary.
9,175492846,Rebecca Davidge,• East Colfax,31 Jan,Last week a guy was walking his two dogs and didn’t have a tight enough grip and the dog took off and ran at my dog. A couple weeks ago at Verbena park a pitbull mutt wasn’t on the leash and ran at my dog. These off leash rules should be much more strict especially when you got a small dog and little kids walking around!!!!
10,175492846,Michele DB,• Lowry,31 Jan,"Agreed. How in the heck can this even be enforced? When there’s an attack or even the threat of one, by the time you try to take any sort of action, the dog could run away or the owner can, or whatever, and then what do you do!?!? 😡"
11,175492846,Susan Pluss,• Lowry,31 Jan,"Similar thing happened to me a few yers ago.  So scary, sorry this happened to you."
12,175492846,María Wetzel,• Del Mar Parkway,31 Jan,"The same here very scary I didn’t even know how I managed to carried my dog he is kind of heavy, yes but I thought the pill bull would come after me, some are sweet but still unpredictable"
13,175492846,Michelle Birchby,• East Washington Virginia Vale,31 Jan,Maybe we all need to start carrying a cattle prod. I wonder if that would make people more inclined to keep their dogs on leash and under control.
14,175492846,Michele DB,• Lowry,11w,"Maybe you’re onto something...? At the very least, some sort of protection that can be accessed and used quickly.(edited)"
15,175492846,Shannon Daly,• Central Park,31 Jan,Carry pepper spray.  Sabre makes a good one that is immediate and sprays pretty far but isn't damaging long term.  Might be a little easier to carry with you than a cattle prod? 😁
16,175492846,Edith Garcia,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,31 Jan,"I think we all should remember that it doesn’t matter if you have a pitbull, a puddle... or any other dog. As owners is OUR collective responsibility to keep our dogs leashed when in public. It doesn’t matter how amazing and well behaved your dogs are, it is a RULE! "
17,175492846,Kyra Frank,• South Park Hill,31 Jan,Agree! Wish people would follow the rules so no one makes stereotypes about breeds
18,175492846,Tasha Safford,• Hilltop,31 Jan,"I'm sorry this happened to you, but there aren't bad dogs, inherently, just bad owners."
19,175492846,Edith Garcia,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,31 Jan,Completely agree
20,175492846,Brent Valente,• Hale,31 Jan,Invest in some Shield Spray
21,175492846,Tree Wallace,• East Colfax,31 Jan,what is shield spray and where do you get it?
22,175492846,Aaron Wi,• East Colfax,31 Jan,I hope David's dog is OK.   BTW is Shield Spray effective?  Thanks.
23,175492846,Jennifer Perlman,• Central Park,1 Feb,"Hi David thank you for letting us know. I’m really sorry for you and your dog, I hope you two recover and the psychological impact fades over time. I Have had something less severe happen as well and it’s VERY upsetting. Peace"
24,175492846,Jeff Payne,• Historic Montclair,1 Feb,"I think everyone agrees that, ""there are no bad dogs, only bad owners."" And while I understand that people want to jump in and defend pit bulls, and that their heart is in a good place, it distracts from the matter at hand: an unleashed aggressive dog attacked a leashed dog, and the owner of the aggressive dog showed zero accountability."
25,175492846,Suzanne Challinor,• Central Park,1 Feb,"Dog on dog attacks are tragic enough. How would respondents react if that same unleashed, aggressive dog attacked a small child? Unimaginable horror. This goes beyond a lack of accountability."
26,175492846,Donovan Holligan,• Mir Park,1 Feb,This is your best friend when it comes to aggressive dogs!!
27,175492846,Nadia Garcia,• Del Mar Parkway,1 Feb,"Hi Donovan, where can I purchase that if you don’t mind me asking. I’m just afraid of a dog attacking my sons dog when we take him out for walks."
28,175492846,Dorothy Hotchkiss,• Hale,1 Feb,I am so sorry this happened to you and your pup..I hope your pup is ok..
0,169260623,Anne Morawski,• Congress Park,20w,I’m getting ready to clean out a bunch of old towels this week. Should I bring them to your garage or to the shelter directly?(edited)
1,169260623,Melly Kinnard,• Lowry,29 Nov,My garage is better and since I coordinate the drop offs with the shelters.

8,169260623,Sherry Johnson,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,29 Nov,Are they looking for only new items or will they accept “like new”?
9,169260623,Melly Kinnard,• Lowry,29 Nov,Worn things are appreciated too.
10,169260623,Christina Johnson,• Central Park,29 Nov,Is this only for adults and do you want coats too?

13,169260623,Elizabeth MacDonald,• Lowry,29 Nov,Could someone do a porch pick up in Lowry?
14,169260623,Melly Kinnard,• Lowry,29 Nov,You can drop things at my garage at your convenience.  I will pick up if dropping things won't work for you.  Thank you!!
15,169260623,Elizabeth MacDonald,• Lowry,29 Nov,Thank you. I’m a disabled senior but like to help our community. A front porch pick up is best for me.
16,169260623,Melly Kinnard,• Lowry,30 Nov,Let me know when you would like me to pick up.  You can use my email.  denvermelly@msn.com
17,169260623,Elizabeth MacDonald,• Lowry,29 Nov,"Thank you, Melly, for what you are doing. I have clean unused socks for women and some nice towels. And other things, depending on what’s needed."
18,169260623,David Wagner,• Hale,30 Nov,"Can i get some towels, and socks and just drop them off?"

21,169260623,Melly Kinnard,• Lowry,1 Dec,I just talked to the shelter manager.  They don't have room to store any more clothes.  If there are new clothes she will use them for gift bags for Christmas.
22,169260623,Melly Kinnard,• Lowry,30 Nov,I left a message for the shelter manager.
23,169260623,Heather Luehrs,• Lowry,30 Nov,"Thanks for info, Melly!  My husband is Executive Dir of st Francis Center and would graciously take socks and blankets, also!  We live at 6925 E 3rd!"

13,169449027,Camille Lacey,• Central Park,20w,"Yes! Cats too!! If its too cold for you to be outside, you should never force your pets outside. The absolute minimum temp for letting your cat out is 45. 50 degrees is better. Either way, cats should always have a warm place to come into wherever they are ready (aka your living room). Honestly,same for dogs. Dogs dont like being outside in the cold all day!! Poor things(edited)"

20,169449027,Diane Dahl,• Sable Altura Chambers,2 Dec,"Thank You, I hear dogs barking all day, one sounds small and like it is in pain.   Even in the summer....."
21,169449027,Dakota Richardson,• Del Mar Parkway,2 Dec,Legally as long as the dog has shelter from the elements and access to food and water the only thing you can do is file a noise ordinance complaint. That being said some dogs like being outside. Given half the choice my girl would live outside if I let her. And dogs bark y'all. 🤷🏼‍♀️ 9x out if 10 they're barking at a perceived threat.
22,169449027,Caitlin Crowell,• Morris Heights,2 Dec,"Not the point of the message I’m trying to say at all. Obviously it’s different when you can tell a dog wants to be outside. But when I see a dog that is chained up outside, shaking, hiding underneath the trampoline, that’s when it’s a problem. I didn’t post this to complain about dogs barking, my point about them barking all day is that I can hear them barking all day which means they are outside all day"
23,169449027,Dakota Richardson,• Del Mar Parkway,2 Dec,"And like I said. All you can do is report a noise ordinance complaint, that will cause AC to go out and from there they will determine if the dog is being neglected or not. But legally as long as it has shelter, food and water there's nothing that they'll do except fine the owner after multiple complaints. And you contradict yourself tbh. You say you didn't post to complain about the barking but yet your main topic of this post is the dog is outside barking all day. Or is it that you believe the dog is being neglected or abused because it's outside all day on a tie out and lays under a trampoline. Dogs shake and bark and whine and like to lay under things. Just because a dog isn't indoors 24/7 doesn't mean it's abused or neglected hun. Same with being on a tie out. If the dog is on a tie out it's probably to keep the dog in the yard. Not all dogs like to be tied out so they tend to bark/whine. If it's such an issue or it bothers you so bad then call animal control simple as that."
24,169449027,Caitlin Crowell,• Morris Heights,2 Dec,"My post was to simply remind people to not let there dogs be outside all day when it’s 19 degrees outside. And yes, my point of bringing up the barking was because it means the dog is outside all day because I can hear it. I do not care to hear the sound of a dog barking at all. I understand the whole noise complaint thing because you already said that in your previous post. This was in no way meant to start a fight. I understand why people have their dogs outside and why they are tied up because I have my own animals that have to go outside or have had to been tied up before. I also understand that dogs shake and bark and whine and I don’t need to be reminded of that. It sounds like you’re trying to defend or make excuses for people that leave their dogs outside all day, which is sad."
25,169449027,LAWRENCE WILSON,• Northeast Park Hill,2 Dec,What ever happened to dog houses
26,169449027,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,3 Dec,"I agree. Dog houses offer a small space, not like the completely open area underneath a trampoline, where an animal inside a dog house is sheltered from the wind, not laying directly on the ground, and being small, some heat from the dog’s body and breathing will warm up the space a little bit"
27,169449027,Samantha Robles,• East Colfax,2 Dec,Thank you for your post!! Breaks my heart too.
28,169449027,Samantha Robles,• East Colfax,2 Dec,I’m tired hearing excuses. It’s pathetic.
29,169449027,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,3 Dec,"Just think how you would feel having to stand outside all day and/or night with only a jacket on. If you love your dogs, for goodness sake, take care of them!"
30,169449027,Caitlin Crowell,• Morris Heights,3 Dec,Exactly!! If you can’t handle the weather then your dog shouldn’t have to!!
31,169449027,LAWRENCE WILSON,• Northeast Park Hill,3 Dec,If only people felt the same about the homeless people out there with no shelter
32,169449027,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,3 Dec,I think they do but we’re talking about an animal that they have adopted and agree to be responsible for. Caring for a dog is a LOT different than taking a homeless person into your house to feed and care for.

2,171735654,Alison G.,• Congress Park,24 Dec,Here is info for someone who is collecting them.
0,179869597,Merrilee Saathoff,• Northeast Park Hill,12 Mar,Keep in mind the amount of money the developer paid for the property. As with most developments these days only a very small percentage of high density is set aside for low income. The city needs to honor the agreement made to voters when we paid Clayton to keep the property as open space.
1,179869597,Kate Hakala,• South Park Hill,12 Mar,"Absolutely!   The intent of the conservation easement that the city taxpayers was that this property never be developed.   Wellington Webb, Federico Pena and Gov Lamm have all spoken out against removal of the easement.   But the developers gave Hancock $400,000 so they got a sweetheart deal"
2,179869597,Harry Doby,• Northeast Park Hill,6w,"Assuming the city can tear up the $2million conservation easement, that will instantly increase the value of the property 3 or 4 fold.  Then Westside can do what they have done in the past and sell off part of the land.   At the newly appraised higher value they could probably sell the 60 acres for ""parks"" back to the city for, oh say, $24 to 30 million?(edited)"
3,179869597,Jeremiah Zentz,• Northeast Park Hill,12 Mar,Sounds like their intent is to push through development
4,179869597,Harry Doby,• Northeast Park Hill,12 Mar,There is no mention at all about the conservation easement in the survey.  We added our comment on the final line that to us it is a fatal omission for a statistically valid survey.
5,179869597,Allie Ess,• Northeast Park Hill,12 Mar,"I got this survey and I have only been in the area for a year, but like the other commenters I emphasized the desire to keep this area as open space. I commented that it would be nice to have sidewalks added to parks in the neighborhood that are missing sidewalk in some stretches and that it would be nice to have trash cans/service in the PHGC open space if it is kept as such."
6,179869597,Fredrick Glick,• Clayton,12 Mar,"I have yet to see the survey, but generally when ""Affordable"" is used in this context (and most especially when it is used by the city and  capitalized) it refers to some level of income restricted housing, generally starting at 80% of AMI (area median income) and often going as low as 30% of AMI.  The most recent AMI levels for Denver can be found here:  https://www.denvergov.org/content/dam/denvergov/Portals/housing-resources/documents/2020AMI.pdf"
7,179869597,Shane Murphy,• Northeast Park Hill,12 Mar,Thanks for sharing this info Fredrick Glick - hope you are well.
8,179869597,Shane Murphy,• Northeast Park Hill,12 Mar,"Hello Neighbors, Harry Doby - thank you for pointing this out. If this survey truly does not highlight the fact that the Conservation Easement would have to be removed, then i do not believe this is an accurate survey. Simply put - the community does not have the full facts to be able to answer the questions in an educated way. What a horrible display of a corrupt process. Regardless of your beliefs on the matter, asking to answer without all the details is not appropriate. We need to ensure this is brought to the attention of the planning and steering committee. I believe this survey is already invalid and should be thrown out for a new survey."
9,179869597,Fredrick Glick,• Clayton,12 Mar,"If there is any outcome other than an 18 hole golf course, the easement will at the very least need to be amended."
10,179869597,sadie martinez,• Central Park,12 Mar,"Affordable housing means lower than market rent , the income limits in Denver for a 2 bedroom unit is $1297. This is updated yearly and it is the area median income"
11,179869597,Kate Swan,• South Park Hill,6w,"I read the survey.  Not surprisingly, it seems to be designed to elicit the responses the city wishes to receive.  For example, in one question, they ask, ""In addition to the parks and recreation opportunities identified in Question 4, which of the following uses and services would you also want to see at this site (if any).""  Such question is clearly designed to suggest that development of the land in some form is going to occur, and that they want input about what kind of development it should be.  But, in fact, the most critical question (which should have been answered BEFORE city funds were used to facilitate this process) is whether any portion of the land can be developed where the conservation easement paid for by Denver taxpayers seems to prevent it.

No kill doesn't actually mean ""no kill"", it's very misleading. ""No kill' generally means the shelter has a 90%+ live release rate.

0,178870327,Jaxson Heyrend,• East Colfax,2 Mar,"See the thing about police reports, is that they usually go nowhere if there is no evidence. Police will usually say, “I’m sorry, but there’s not much we can do unless we have a lead to who commit the crime.” Whereas, if the community is aware of what’s going on, then more people are likely to witness crimes and will likely lead to an arrest. If the community is aware of the situation, then people are more likely to be more proactive in stopping the crime from happening. This app is a great resource to not only stop crime, but prevent future instances from happening again."
1,178870327,Tehani deGuzman,• Lyn Knoll,3 Mar,This!
2,178870327,Bryan Sperber,• Central Park,2 Mar,I’m with jaxson on this. We just had another post where we’re trying to get a neighborhood watch together simple to help report more crimes and hopefully prevent all the insane surges in crimes.
3,178870327,Dereck Blackford,• City Park,3 Mar,Make a seperate app
4,178870327,Andy Billinger,• Lowry,2 Mar,Delete the app
5,178870327,Jeremiah Baldwin,• Central Park,2 Mar,Concur
6,178870327,Wendy Booth,• North Park Hill,2 Mar,It’s important to find a balance. Considering every little thing out of the ordinary “suspicious” is emotionally draining and potentially discriminatory. But we also need to keep each other informed. Common sense in reporting activity and protection of self go a long way towards building healthier communities.
7,178870327,Audrey Maddox,• City Park,5 Mar,"I agree, making posts about someone standing somewhere in some odd way is unnecessary."
8,178870327,Brooke Haddock,• Central Park,7w,I get what you’re saying. Our neighborhood lives reporting any person walking in an alley or any “strange” (read: anyone not recognized) car in the alleys. Drives me nuts and is most definitely discriminatory.(edited)
9,178870327,David Navarro,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,2 Mar,"I think if you see something odd or suspicious you should be encouraged to call the police.  (Thats what they tell you to do!!)   Wouldn't be so much crime if everyone watched out for odd, strange, out of place, or suspicious activity so everyone should watch out, thats really what your supposed to do, were supposed to keep an eye out for that, the neighborhood watch stuff has worked for YEARS, it's a proven fact it works to keep crimes down, thats a good neighbor!"
10,178870327,Norma Clark,• East Colfax,4 Mar,I agree wholeheartedly you live in a community. You need to watch out for one another. There several times I've gone up to people and said he what she up to. Knowing that someone's prowling around someone's home. Sometimes posting here a neighbor has seen something that might help. Or at least give emotional support. You can turn off notifications.  That I certainly Appreciate I heads up.
11,178870327,Tatiana Masterson,• Central Park,2 Mar,"Nextdoor is the perfect place to reach out to neighbors and be in touch about issues in the neighborhood. The neighborhood watch forming now is due to activities reported by neighbors here. I would not have known about certain activities if they would not be posted on Nextdoor. If they make you feel uncomfortable or anxious, perhaps skipping these posts would be a better solution then asking neighbors not to report them as often. I say this respectfully."
12,178870327,Brooke Haddock,• Central Park,2 Mar,I’m excited about the neighborhood watch and fully support that. It’s just the middle of the day and someone walked by and looked at my house posts that seem fear based and not fact based. People should be able to walk around without being deemed “suspicious “.
13,178870327,Tatiana Masterson,• Central Park,7w,"Brooke Haddock, what we are talking about is the opposite of people walking around being ‘suspicious’. It’s about people pepping into our homes, steeling packages, trespassing, opening car doors, breaking into cars, breaking cars windows and handles, following us, home invasion and that kind of stuff. Nobody is looking for ‘suspicious’ people as we don’t know what a suspicious person looks like.(edited)"
14,178870327,Charlene/Joseph Medina,• East Colfax,3 Mar,I agree 💯! I sleep well and I want to continue to do so. Most of these reports come from people who have those video cameras but they still don’t catch the suspect. Thank you for your request.
15,178870327,Genn La,• East Colfax,3 Mar,Ignore or scroll past the posts or even delete the app I think it’s helpful for those of us who are concerned about our neighborhoods. Sorry it is a “small post” to you but may not be to others.
16,178870327,Kristi Steinbron,• Mayfair,7w,"Almost 3 years in this neighborhood. The crime and ""suspicious activity"" did not used to be as much as it is now. But I still live off Colfax, so I still pay attention and lock my doors etc. However, Nextdoor I think has been a great tool for communicating with people in the neighborhood about anything and everything. Not just crime and suspension. I haven't been a regular poster but, I think it's a good thing. People don't know their neighbors well enough these days. I spent the last 7 years in Cap Hill before Mayfair. I've seen enough. Pandemic and unemployment has crime on the rise. Keep an eye out. The whole neighborhood doesn't live off Colfax, but the increase in illegal activity would suggest otherwise. If you're scared, maybe this is not the neighborhood for you. Maybe the suburbs. 🤷‍♀️ But, I dunno about discouraging the people in the neighborhood to not communicate with each other.. just so one person doesn't have to be scared. That seems a bit ignorant of reality. Don't use the app. Turn off the notification. The local news has just as many reports of bad things happening. The world we live in can only improve if we work together and communicate. "
17,178870327,Latoyia Hough,• Clayton,18 Mar,"I agree with you 100% with what you just said. We need this app to inform us with what’s going in our neighborhood.  I appreciate knowing when someone pet is missing and I can help be on the lookout. When someone car been broken into and other meaningful post. However, it’s unfortunate that only one person is overwhelm with the app sensitive information being posted. I agree that that person can delete the app entirely and don’t have to be scared, nervous, panicky and Whatever else that’s going on with the person."
18,178870327,Robin Black,• East Colfax,3 Mar,"Your mental/ emotional health is your responsibility. If the things posted on this forum are making you uneasy, it’s on you to walk away. It’s not the responsibility of people posting on here to determine what YOU would consider to be “scary” or not. I absolutely, positively HATE scary movies. As a result, I do not watch them. I do not ban them, boycott them or plead for Hollywood to make less of them or to make them less scary. I just recognize they are not for me and don’t watch them. Your peace of mind is YOUR responsibility."
19,178870327,Monica Bryant-Taylor,• North Park Hill,6 Mar,Well said!  Thank you
20,178870327,Travis Haley,• Historic Montclair,7w,It might be easier to filter what you see than asking others to filter it for your preference. If you click the 3 dots on the bottom right and scroll down a bit. Under “Neighborhood” you’ll see the categories you can click to see only posts related to that category. Further down under “Topics” you can customize what shows up more or less in your feed.(edited)
21,178870327,Monica Bryant-Taylor,• North Park Hill,6 Mar,Well said!  Thank you
22,178870327,Heather Mann,• Central Park,3 Mar,I think it is good to be informed and when things are posted it helps us all be aware. Usually the people posting things are calling the police too but it’s looking out for everyone.  If it tends to cause anxiety I would just take a break from next door or maybe just don’t look at the posts but for many it really does help people to be more cautious and alert    💛
23,178870327,Debbie Livingood,• Sunny Vale,3 Mar,"It's good to post those things here, it keeps everyone else alert and what to watch out for. If you are feeling uneasy about the posts, don't read them and keep scrolling. Living off Colfax is nothing but a reason for something to happen and always has been."
24,178870327,Stacey Clerk,• Lowry,3 Mar,"The reason we are on this app is for the safety information, it's great that everybody posts things to keep us all up to date. Maybe instead of asking the neighborhood to censor safety hazards and risks, perhaps you could reach out to the next door app and see if they could create a feature where you could filter out the safety items so that you don't have to see it, but everybody else still gets to benefit from the great information that is shared."
25,178870327,Monica Bryant-Taylor,• North Park Hill,6 Mar,"She's holding it in her hand!  She can filter her settings, delete the app or keep scrolling so she doesn't have to read those posts."
26,178870327,Cathlene Santos,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,3 Mar,"I have lived in my neighborhood for 38 years and I’m not going anywhere! This app not only helps us know what’s going on around us it also brings us together so that we can look out for each other. Just so happens that during this time crime is up everywhere not just in our area’s, and most people care to know what’s going on around them."
27,178870327,Monica Bryant-Taylor,• North Park Hill,6 Mar,"Right Cathlene!  Thank you, well said!"
28,178870327,Beth Celva,• Congress Park,11 Mar,Absolutely. You are right!
29,178870327,Debbie P.,• Cherry Creek East,3 Mar,I do agree that some posts are a bit overboard but for the most part I appreciate knowing my neighbors care enough to share so maybe it won’t happen to the next person.
30,178870327,Matt Kap,• Congress Park,3 Mar,Not sure I want her opinion on all of the lost dog posts
31,178870327,Emily VanGetson,• East Colfax,3 Mar,I’m sorry but I prefer to know what’s going on around me ! I would suggest not to look at your app  🤷‍♀️
32,178870327,Monica Bryant-Taylor,• North Park Hill,6 Mar,"Thank you, well said!"
33,178870327,Julie Ehlers,• Central Park,3 Mar,"I agree that there are a lot of posts about the same thing etc. However, we should keep one another informed. I suggest that you take a break from reading them. Just don't look and you will begin to feel better. All best, J"

5,167094481,Don Leaderach,• Northeast Park Hill,9 Nov,"10pm is when the virus comes out. Kind of like vampires. Mark my words, the people elected will scare and force us to submit."
6,167094481,Jose Amaro,• Elyria Swansea,9 Nov,Im home on most days by 6-7pm and dont leave the house unless i really need to. Really cant wrap my head around how this will control us. Its just a curfew i can leave my house whenever i want no one can stop me 😂. But what i do take away from this is please be responsible and lets put this pandemic behind us safe distancing and put a mask on.
0,168281283,Angel Rodriguez,• Mayfair,18 Nov,Have you tried coalition for the homeless or the gathering place?
1,168281283,Jessica Webb,• South Park Hill,18 Nov,"Yes, been in touch with all the services. Just have a few things left needed."
2,168281283,Glenn Godden,• Mayfair,18 Nov,I don't have any of these things but I would like to buy them a new microwave.

4,168281283,Tara Crewe,• Mayfair,18 Nov,"I’m guessing someone will see this tomorrow who will have a baby bathtub they’re looking to get rid of. If not, PM me. I’ll gladly purchase one."
5,168281283,Jessica Webb,• South Park Hill,19 Nov,"No one has offered a bath tub yet, but I agree that is something lots of families may have to donate. Can I give it a day and let you know?"
6,168281283,Tara Crewe,• Mayfair,19 Nov,Jessica Webb Perfect!
7,168281283,Emily Razavi,• East Colfax,19 Nov,Im picking up some of my furniture from my storage unit tomorrow and would be happy to donate some items
8,168281283,Jessica Webb,• South Park Hill,19 Nov,"Hi Emily - you’re so kind! At this point, I think the only furniture is the long, wide dresser. If you have one like that it would be amazing! Thank you for your kind offer!"
9,168281283,TM V.,• Hale,19 Nov,We have a dresser... it’s not a long dresser but has three drawers and is in great shape.
10,168281283,Jessica Webb,• South Park Hill,19 Nov,I’m hoping to find something that can double as storage and changing table (since she doesn’t have much space) so hoping for long and wide. But if nothing comes up like this can I reach back out? So grateful for your kind offer!!
11,168281283,Jessica Webb,• South Park Hill,19 Nov,Hi neighbors - I forgot that were also looking for a baby swing. She has one but could really use one more.

15,168281283,Jessica Brown,• Congress Park,19 Nov,Hi Jessica- just saw this on Facebook marketplace. The first pic is only of the night stand so it may have been over looked. Keep me posted and I can reach out to others in the meantime.
16,168281283,Sara Breindel,• Congress Park,19 Nov,"We have dresser that is set up as a changing table as well. Would be happy to donate, but it has one broken drawer. (Solid maple, six drawers total; five are working). If you don't get a better item, happy to donate."
17,168281283,Jessica Webb,• South Park Hill,19 Nov,Hi Sara - if it’s in good shape other than the drawer I think it would work. Is there any chance you have a truck or vehicle you could deliver with? I don’t right now so it’s complicating things a bit.
18,168281283,Jacqueline P Moore,• Northeast Park Hill,19 Nov,Hi I would like to help I have a microwave

2,170179162,Jerrica Zimmermann,• North Park Hill,10 Dec,Laura Avant Hi! I have a bunch of beanies I’d love to donate. They may nor be the absolute warmest but they’re brand new; my mom crocheted them for me to pass out to the homeless but this feels like a great opportunity to give them away. Please let me know if you’re interested :)
3,170179162,Denise Nation,• Locust St,8 Dec,"Hi Laura, I am moving and have lots of clothing food and bedding. I will gather some things tomorrow morning."
4,170179162,Laura Avant,• Northeast Park Hill,10 Dec,"Thank you so much!  Most of the ""stuff"" is ready for my  manager to pick up, but I did save some really nice things (Italian designer clothes, leather jackets) to sell online to make cash for underwear, socks and toiletries.  I will press it up and post it on the NE neighborhood site, so if you see things that that were yours, rest assured that all the proceeds will  go to the homeless.  I have also pulled a lot of the children's things to give to the ARC in return for my $200 monthly vouchers, so  you have helped me indirectly there too.  Thank your son for being generous..  Watch out or he could become a social  worker and don't want that."
5,170179162,Heike Adlerz,• RiNo Art District,16 Dec,"Hi Laura Avant I have a good amount of clothes that I'd like to donate. I tried calling but your voice-mail is full, can you pm me on how to best get in contact? Thank you!"

I would love to meet you somewhere to receive your donation or ask you to drop it off at my house.  I can only go out on Thursday and Friday before a COVID test on Sat and double quarantine until my surgery on Tuesday, but my husband may be willing to come to you.  If you would like to contact me quickly, my phone no. is 303-316-6748.  I can give you our address when you call or we can arrange a pick up..  Thank you so much!

Rather than give your address during such times as this, here ins my phone number:  303-316-6748.  We will be home as I double quarantine after my COVID test and before my Tuesday surgery.

After the first dose my wife had a sore arm the next day and I was business as usual. For us the second dose is where we saw side effects. The day after the second we both had the chills, joint/muscle pain, and she had a headache. The next day all symptoms were gone and we felt normal. "

8,182982262,Merrilee Saathoff,• Northeast Park Hill,10 Apr,Have had both doses. Soreness at injection site worse after first one and felt lethargic that day. Plenty of hydration before and after helpful.
9,182982262,DeeAnne Held,• Hoffman Heights,10 Apr,I’ve had both shots.  Sore arm both times and fatigue after the second.  But the relief that I’d had them was wonderful!
10,182982262,Jason Grout,• East Colfax,10 Apr,After the first shot I had slight reactions similer to a cold. Second shot had no sysmtoms. But i have heard diffrent things from others. So it must vary from person to person.

19,182982262,Nadine Rains,• Aurora,10 Apr,My first vaccine wasn’t bad. Just a week of arm soreness! My second one made me feel like I had a cold for a week. Take time to rest!
20,182982262,Nicole Gravagna,• Montbello,10 Apr,"First dose I had a sore arm for a day. Still waiting on second dose. My partner and parents are fully vaccinated with pfizer and they each reported a minor immune response (general feeling of illness) for a day or so after the second dose.

3,176251823,Scott Bulfin,• Central Park,7 Feb,Agree with a lot of your post! The plusses of cities are there a lot of things to see and do. The negatives- more crime unfortunately-especially the car break ins and garage thefts.

8,176251823,Burt Keems,• Central Park,8 Feb,Alan I also agree your point with  living in a city. There seems to be an escalating sense of angst and criminal behavior growing day by day. That topped with an ever increasing homeless population it is slowly becoming a not so nice place to live. From the nightly gun shots to car break-ins and thefts things are truly trending down. Not trying to be a “Debbie-Downer” but we are in some strange times.

15,176251823,Beth Colwell,• South Park Hill,9 Feb,It seems COVID-19 hasn't helped.  Yes the city has grown but so have I.  In the 40s people worried about hobos.  If you lived near enough to the trains you had to be careful about feeding them.  They would put a sign on your fence or door and soon you would be able to open your own soup kitchen.

0,180874084,Kay Dragon,• Hoffman Heights,21 Mar,Good question because sometimes I like to tip in cash hoping that the driver gets it
1,180874084,Amands Mamah,• Morris Heights,21 Mar,I work for door dash and we do get the whole tip we get as little as 3$ before tip though and takes a minimum of 30 mins to drive to the restaurant wait for the food and deliver it. Then take into consideration if you are In an apartment or business office.
2,180874084,Kaytee Cowperthwaite,• Hoffman Heights,21 Mar,Do you get paid a percentage of the total of the order? Or by mileage? Or a flat rate?
3,180874084,Leigha Fillenworth,• Hoffman Heights,4w,"I worked for Instacart a little over a year ago... And their system works this same way.  Of course with Instacart, I did all of the shopping myself from several different varieties of stores, but I found it to be quite beneficial. I didn't ""work hard"" at all..  an average of 3-4 days a week, between 6-12 deliveries (depending on size of delivery), approximately 6 hrs per day...averaged out to be a good $150-250/WK (tips incl).  Keep in mind...  I had a Suburban at that point in time, so I could manage some large loads.   Anyways.. hope that helps a bit.(edited)"
4,180874084,Amands Mamah,• Morris Heights,21 Mar,It’s a percentage of the total I think we don’t get to see what your total is I can just estimate by what I pick up.
5,180874084,Therese Z.,• Tower Triangle,22 Mar,I know Walmart delivery’s are through a third party. You can chose the amount when you are placing your order. 
6,180874084,Jill Getz,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,22 Mar,"Walmart also uses Door Dash :).  They give you a flat fee for picking up and then can also have a peak price added ( if applicable). And then the person you deliver it to can up their tip if they want. I have done quite well with door dash as far as what I make and tips, except for the guy that left me a penny 😢😢. I would have rather gotten nothing !!!  Otherwise it is a fun gig to have 😊"
7,180874084,Kaytee Cowperthwaite,• Hoffman Heights,22 Mar,"Jill, is the flat fee based on the purchase price or is it the same for all orders?"
8,180874084,Jill Getz,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,22 Mar,Kaytee Cowperthwaite here is a sample of my pay. I will also find a Walmart one for reference
9,180874084,Jill Getz,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,22 Mar,Here is Walmart
10,180874084,Madison Rodgers,• Locust St,28 Mar,Do you do the shopping for Walmart orders? I know when I order like Walgreens or Dashmart from doordash you guys have to pick the stuff out. But I always wondered about Walmart.
11,180874084,Kaytee Cowperthwaite,• Hoffman Heights,22 Mar,"Awesome, thank you!!!"
12,180874084,Jill Getz,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,22 Mar,Just remember these are just samples from my working :):)

14,180874084,Charras Scott,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Mar,As experience working for door dash and in many group I see so many customers will fake a complaint saying they didn’t get there food just to get more food or a refund!
15,180874084,Jill Getz,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,4w,"That’s not all drivers. Some of us need the money bad enough, we deliver !!!!!(edited)"
16,180874084,Desiree Sandoval,• Central Park,22 Mar,For sure not all. That's just the one I get the most problems with. We have a ton of deliveries that go thru doordash with no problems. But also the most issues with them
17,180874084,Jodi Garza,• Sable Altura Chambers,23 Mar,With Doordash it's more the app than the drivers... always try to cash tip...  with restaurant deliveries... Instacart is a base of $8. Plus % of order. We get 100% of tips.
18,180874084,Charras Scott,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Mar,"I work door dash, post mates and fetch I can send you a link to that"

20,180874084,Abeth Parisian,• East Colfax,23 Mar,"Are the delivery workers only earning $3 for a delivery?  Is it just $3 or minimum wage plus $3 (and possible tip)?  If it’s just $3 and tips, how can one live on that?  (I am not at all implying minimum wage and $3 is a livable income)."
21,180874084,Madison Rodgers,• Locust St,3w,"Some deliveries don't take very long so you can do multiple an hour. And I think maybe you can pick up more than one order at a time? Not sure. Plus DoorDash automatically selects a ""suggested tip"" which I think is 15%, but you can take it off or change it... I don't know how many people change it. For me a $40 order is like a $7 tip."
22,180874084,Jodi Garza,• Sable Altura Chambers,24 Mar,"It's not the best , but it fits into alot of people's schedules. Most of the time they do 3 to 4 deliveries an hour.."

1,179223880,David Rochlin,• Hilltop,6 Mar,"This latest incident almost doesn't even rise to the level of theft. What's the market value (on Nextdoor, perhaps?) of those pillows? The ""thief"" might get $2 for them, even though it's a $50-100 cost to you to replace them. It seems more like vandalism. Pretty poor pay for being outside walking around, perhaps for hours, at 3 am. And who's going to buy a security camera from some random person who obviously stole it? Another pointless act of pillaging."

4,179223880,shannon quillian,• North Park Hill,6 Mar,That is sooooo Wrong in sooo many ways. I am so sad and sorry this happened to you all
5,179223880,Craigers Hanzelka,• Central Park,7 Mar,"I am sorry you have been dealing with this. First and foremost, since Brinks is your choice of security camera service(if you are in fact paying a monthly fee), they should be held responsible for the ""pilfering"" of your possessions."
6,179223880,Terry Sipes,• Mayfair,7 Mar,The line of daily/nightly theft has pushed itself south from North Colfax to open game from Alameda North these past five years. I lived in Mayfair for 10 years never heard of such a thing back then. 
7,179223880,Susan Palmer,• Historic Montclair,6w,"I’m sorry this happened. Having lived in Denver my whole life, I’ve never seen crime at this rate. There are many explanations for it but the main reason is that due to the movement of defunding the police.  Our police force is that of 1982. Denver was much less populated then.  COVID hasn’t helped either. Perpetrators know they won’t go to jail, especially for property crimes. This makes them more brazen.(edited)"

9,179223880,Susan Palmer,• Historic Montclair,7 Mar,"Joan Baronberg, he hasn’t cared about Denver since his first term. He had used the office for his own benefit regardless of what the people of Denver want or need."
10,179223880,Gina Dunn,• South Park Hill,7 Mar,Seriously? Stealing pillows? That is one pathetic soul... I think the word is “ loser”
11,179223880,Terry Sipes,• Mayfair,7 Mar,"In my opinion, simple comments on Nextdoor wont get the issue resolved, only hard (real news) action will slow this process down.  It's up to every individual on your block, neighborhood, that will make a difference. From telling little Johnny to not leave his bike in the yard, forget you left the garage door open, your $5K bike hanging from the garage ceiling and having a open window view to the nice things on your not so private front porch...sad times...planning will help, so those that read this...think if you want too,  how can I make my home a more solid fortress and fix the issues at hand (you don't want to be the  next victim), that is what part of Sunday is made for in my mind, property maintenance... Harbor Freight has great cheap cameras, ring as well, HD/Lowes have gate locks, security light, solar to hard wired.. lots of fencing companies in Denver metro...yes sad but its your property to enjoy and to protect.

12,179223880,Gloria BURNS,• East Colfax,7 Mar,"I'm with you Terry i have been saying this a long time ago,people think all they have to do is put up a camera and life is safe.how many people have gotten any feed back from the police or the city.we have to take responsibility for our home if you know you are going to have delivery ask for it to be left at a safe place like the post office.the police is not going to investigate all of the theft we have not just in Denver but all over the country.there is more of us than cops let's help each others one way is by just looking into  the suggestion we are getting and try to help our selves if you steal something from me once i am going to learn from that and figure out how it won't happen again I am getting the feeling that people have a lot of money. i sure wish someone can give me a couple hundred (SMILE) PEACE HAVE A GREAT SUNDAY"
13,179223880,Gregory Clark,• Mayfair,7 Mar,Does anyone know if its ok to taser a porch pirate?
14,179223880,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,7 Mar,"I'd like to dream up some kind of nasty prank so that no laws are broken and nobody has to go to court to justify their actions. The poop-in-a-box for porch pirates was a great example of giving one back to the thieves. Too bad crazy glue dries quickly because I'd love to coat things with crazy glue and then the thieves come and pick it up and find out they can't put it down without tearing the skin off their hands. I'd like to dream up some kinds of retaliations like that - things that would ""serve them right"" but not get anyone doing the prank in any legal trouble."
15,179223880,Gloria BURNS,• East Colfax,7 Mar,"Before you do check with the law,some  time the bad guys have more rights"
16,179223880,Gill Miles,• North Park Hill,7 Mar,"It is sad to say that the criminals have figured out that they have more rights than we do. I guess I really don't understand how a person is allowed to sell a CATALYTIC CONVERTER to a scrap yard, especially when they know that it is stolen. I am proposing a new law that simply states that if you sell a CAT CONVERTER to a scrap yard, you have to have state issued I.D. and the V.I.N. number of the vehicle that the CAT CONVERTER came off of."
17,179223880,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,7 Mar,The VIN number now is visible in the front windshield. In my older cars I was able to put something on the dash to cover it but now it's embedded inside the dash itself so you can't obscure it.
18,179223880,MARCIA CORUM WIEBKE,• South Park Hill,7 Mar,We live in Park Hill 15th & Elm St. and at 2am on Friday night someone tried to steal our gargoyles from the front porch. They found out pretty quickly that the resin gargoyles are mounted on a very heavy concrete base. I think they then got mad and pushed one off and it broke into many pieces. One survived and will no longer reside on the front porch. Very disturbing and has me thinking about moving to the suburbs which is not where I want to live.
19,179223880,Lawrence Johnston,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,7 Mar,I often drive through your area on my way home from work at it is a great part of the world. How much would a new gargoyle cost versus having to move? Last week someone stole a parcel with replacement light switches from my porch. Am I angry and upset? Absolutely. I will not relocate over this.
20,179223880,Gloria BURNS,• East Colfax,7 Mar,"Sorry there are more bad people on this earth than good people, i just watch the news a mother throw her six year old son in a lake.they are trying to find his body just remember this seventh day of march it is going to get so bad only God is going to be able to save us.i had things stolen from me went to the pond shop but could not get my stuff.all we can do is figure out how to lock it down try You Tub see what suggestion you can get then you see what you can come up with,just remember the police can't look at all the pictures and go out looking for the bad thieves they don't have the budget for that,you will make it God will take care off you just think something good is going to come your way (peace)"
21,179223880,Dorothy Todd,• South Park Hill,7 Mar,"We certainly hear more about the bad people but I've found many good, helpful, kind folks and very few bad."
22,179223880,Norma Clark,• East Colfax,8 Mar,It's a shame you can't booby trap your front porch with a string that pours red die down them🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
23,179223880,Gregory Clark,• Mayfair,8 Mar,"Excellent idea! I was also thinking about maybe making a retractable cord attached to the box that had Barbwire on it, or maybe delivered a slight electric shock, low-voltage of course.  This is said slightly tongue in cheek, I’m not actually a vindictive person, just a little tired and feeling mean today."
24,179223880,Norma Clark,• East Colfax,8 Mar,Gregory Clark  Won't physically hurt them. banks do it when they're robbed they throw bombs in their bags
25,179223880,MJ Fuller,• Lowry,8 Mar,"I'm sorry this happened to you.  It's maddening to watch the footage.  I've removed everything from my front porch.  It looks bare and boring, but it's better than having jerks walk off with my stuff.  Hopefully you've moved those nice Adirondack chairs by now.  I'd even bring the doormat inside.  Take care."
26,179223880,Gregory Clark,• Mayfair,9 Mar,"Lmao, I am removing all decorative items from my house as well. Considering having the trees and sod Dug up and sold at auction before someone steals it."

0,169858490,Brandi Marie,• Capitol Hill Central,5 Dec,Timothy Carter will there be tables set up?  I'm asking because I'm wondering (at the risk of being rude) if it would be acceptable to swing by and drop some food off?  Depending on the crowd size I may stock around?  I'm asking about this because I'm a member of the high risk population due to blood cancer and being hydrea (oral chemo).

6,165005164,Karen Black,• South Park Hill,20 Oct,"Urban Outreach in 5 Points is great--they have a shop where homeless and low income can shop with dignity because everything is on hangers and rounders like a store. They can try on clothes and then check out at the register, with no charge in the end. For furniture/household items, the Rescue Mission has the same kind of shop across from the Pct 2 PD station on Holly. You still get a tax receipt, too."

2,180483717,Sheila Cody,• Central Park,17 Mar,Honestly I prefer Sprouts for produce over any other grocery store. And their meats & seafood have surpassed my expectations. It is far less crowded too and decent parking.

8,180483717,Maureen Upton,• Central Park,20 Mar,"Agree, and the Walmart at 60th & Dahlia is way better than Central Park location"
9,180483717,Mandy Gao,• Central Park,17 Mar,"Agreed.  Even Sprouts not far away by distance but still not convenient coming from Beeler Park. Would be great to have something between Northfield and 56th, that's not Target"

It's a lot of work but I love that meal and it gives me a whole bunch of leftovers so I don't have to mess with fixing any other food for the next week! I enjoy it because I can fix what I want and nobody complains about anything.  :D"

0,163913093,Michael Paglia,• Historic Montclair,8 Oct,"Yes outdoor cats are rare in Denver--maybe because of the dangers from foxes, coyotes and racoons. Also Denver has a preponderance of responsible pet owners, so that may explain it, too. Our animal shelters here for instance have to import puppies and kittens for adoptions from more backward places where people don't spay and neuter their pets like they do here."
1,163913093,Gregory Clark,• Mayfair,9 Oct,Backwards? Where are those places?
2,163913093,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,8 Oct,"I can tell you I see them ALL the time since I've moved here about a year ago. Some have collars, some don't, but they all look well kept and not feral."
3,163913093,Carl Horwitz,• Congress Park,28w,"They're normal... as are Nextdoor posts about them, fireworks, stolen bikes, dogs off leash, lost dogs as well as unlocked cars being ""broken into.""(edited)"
4,163913093,Rick and Cathy Reynolds,• South Park Hill,8 Oct,"We've had 3 cats in the past, all outdoor.  One disappeared after a few months and two lived long and healthy lives.  None were de-clawed for their own protection.  Currently there are about 6 roaming our neighborhood during the day."
5,163913093,Keegan Perkins,• Central Park,28w,"I think some people haven’t had cats, and are trying to be helpful, thinking a cat may be lost. They’re different than dogs. That said, I’m sure some cats shouldn’t go outside and do get lost, wander too far, become too independent, or find themselves in trouble. There’s a lot that can happen to any pet outside.(edited)"
6,163913093,Kate Killin,• Northeast Park Hill,28w,"I have an indoor cat and sometimes he tries to bolt outside. Thankfully we have always caught him but if he were to run away I would be devastated to think people would just assume he was an outdoor cat and not check try to catch him. Also, outdoor cats are a threat to wild birds, which already are dying at a high rate. Also, its technically a violation of Denver Animal Code to have an outside cat because you do not have control of your animal if it's free roaming.(edited)"
7,163913093,Cara Tedeschi,• East Colfax,9 Oct,So Denver Animal Control have to pick up a cat and bring it in? Or  What about if there is a collar?
8,163913093,Claire Warnes,• South Park Hill,9 Oct,I’m from the UK and before moving to NY had never heard of ‘indoor’ cats!
9,163913093,James Scott,• North Park Hill,28w,Thank you! Cats are intelligent. They don't need to be prisoners of their people.(edited)
10,163913093,James Scott,• North Park Hill,9 Oct,"Cats are independant intelligent creatures. They do great outdoors. They socialize with other cats & people. I know some cats are incapable of this, but most cats are happier & healthier, much like humans, when they can be active outdoors. If you think outdoor cats are a problem, I think you are a problem."

12,163913093,Jessie Hardy,• Hale,9 Oct,I have an outdoor cat. Or indoor/outdoor. She likes to roam during parts of the day and especially between 3-5 am. I’ve gotten her 5 collars and she’s lost them all. She’s got her claws. When I tried to keep
13,163913093,James Scott,• North Park Hill,9 Oct,Yes! 👏👏👏

15,163913093,Allen Friedman,• Central Park,9 Oct,We don't own any cats but there are a couple of outdoor cats in our neighborhood.  Nothing works better to keep the mice away.
16,163913093,Justine Meyers,• East Colfax,9 Oct,I personally think it depends on the areas. My cat is an indoor cat unless I am outside with him to make sure he’s safe - that being said I live in an apartment and near a very busy intersection.. but when I lived in a more rural area my cat had access to indoors and outdoors and generally didn’t go to far.
17,163913093,Nora Weiker,• East Colfax,9 Oct,"In Brevard CTY fla. there is a large Area between the port and the Hosp. The county  began breeding tux cats. There are at least close to 1000. They have vet care,    fed 2x daily, shelters...it is a sight to see.! N"
18,163913093,Shannon Burton,• Congress Park,9 Oct,"People worry too much.  I grew up in Estes Park and all of our cats were outdoor cats living in the mountains.  They were fine and lived happy long lives. My Mom's most current cat died at 20 the one before that was 18.  If i was a cat I would much rather take the risk and enjoy life and catch mice, then go stir crazy staying inside all the time."
19,163913093,Rae Bevis,• Congress Park,12 Oct,Agreed
20,163913093,Linda Hendrick,• Historic Montclair,9 Oct,"Until recently, I never had indoor cats. But about about 3 years ago, I adopted an 8-year old cat. My other (18-year old) cat would go out in my fenced backyard and sun himself, but never left the yard. The newer 8-year old jumped the 8' fence daily, but jumped it again to get back in the house until . . . the day he didn't and was gone 5 days. Upon his return, the vet bill for his injured leg was almost $500. He was never allowed outside again, and neither was the kitten I adopted 3 years ago. They both appear quite happy to stay indoors."
21,163913093,Shannon Burton,• Congress Park,9 Oct,"People jump to conclusions when they see animals.  Like this guy thinks he is ""rescuing"" puppies, and the vet tells the guy to return the litter of pups back to where he took them because they are fox cubs and he took them from thier Mother.  🤦"
22,163913093,Dakota Mancillas,• East Colfax,28w,"Depends on where in Denver I guess, my cat growing up didn’t like being inside but he liked being bad and beating up the neighbors dog & cats so we tried to keep him inside lol but mainly he went outside & came back home whenever he pleased (before he started being bad)(edited)"
23,163913093,shannon quillian,• North Park Hill,9 Oct,I can’t really add cuz I have had many cats and keep them indoors But last winter there was a cat that came to my backdoor and looked cold and hungry. It was snowing. I felt sorry for it and fed it and built a makeshift shelter out of boxes and blankets only to find out later that it belonged to the lady across the alleyway.
24,163913093,Kacey Mathews,• East Colfax,9 Oct,"No, they’re not. I volunteer at Denver Dumb Friends League & they’re always getting in lost cats. They post pictures of all the lost & found cats on their website."
25,163913093,Oakley Cobb,• South Park Hill,9 Oct,I think that it is becoming more rare as people become aware of the negative impact that outdoor cats have on songbird populations.
26,163913093,Debbie Alther,• Congress Park,9 Oct,Exactly what I was going to say. I love cats and song birds which is why when I had cats they were always indoors.
27,163913093,Judith Holland,• Congress Park,9 Oct,I agree that the dangers of preditors to cats should keep them inside. There are also diseases like feline HIV among others that can kill them.
0,183274903,Beth Toles,• Apache Mesa,12 Apr,Why haven't you called the police??
1,183274903,Carmen Calavera,• Hoffman Heights,12 Apr,"Beth Toles - They won't do anything, they don't even respond to cars being broken into. Also, I just drive by the car everyday, so I thought I'd post it here to see if it was anyone's."

9,183274903,Carolyn Boller,• Hoffman Heights,12 Apr,turn it into code enforcement.
10,183274903,Edgar van Veen,• Highland Park East,12 Apr,Just call the police! They’ll tow away.
11,183274903,Carmen Calavera,• Hoffman Heights,12 Apr,"Edgar van Veen - The cops won't come out. And it's not a bother to me, just trying to help someone maybe missing their car."
12,183274903,Edgar van Veen,• Highland Park East,12 Apr,"We had a similar situation & the police tag it with yellow tags, if nobody moves the vehicle in 3 days, they impound it, if there’s no plates, then they will do a search via vin number. In any case, this is the PROPER WAY TO DO IT!"
13,183274903,Carmen Calavera,• Hoffman Heights,1w,"Edgar van Veen - Well, as I stated eariler, I know nothing about this car and it doesn't bother me one bit as it is not on my block, and to possibly save someone the headache of having to deal with an impound fee, I posted this here just in case. Also, if Park Aurora patrols the area and have been through at least twice, I don't see why they haven't done their job to either tag or have it removed.(edited)"
14,183274903,Edgar van Veen,• Highland Park East,12 Apr,"I really need to add that this is the ONLY WAY FOR THE OWNERS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR CAR! The police WILL contact the proper owners! You can’t, so let the police do their duty! They WILL RESPOND TO AN ABANDONED CAR COMPLAINT!!"
15,183274903,Larissa Chmielewski,• Del Mar Parkway,12 Apr,No.  They won’t show up.  They’ve already driven by it 100 times.

17,183274903,Carmen Calavera,• Hoffman Heights,1w,"Edgar van Veen - And as I said, this car is absolutely no bother to me, I just want to give someone the chance to pick it up before the cops do and hold their car for a fee.(edited)"

4,167403966,Chloe Adams,• CBD,10 Nov,"The Salvation Army doesn’t help gay, trans, or non-Christian homeless people and their facilities are ripe with abuse. I feel like this is gonna hurt more people than it helps, especially since now people will be arguing that there are more shelters so homeless people shouldn’t be on the streets when the shelters might be significantly worse."

7,167403966,Sam G.,• Holly Hills,10 Nov,Please don't slander an institution when a simple search of their website will prove that the SA serves all who are in need:
8,167403966,Robin M.,• Barnum,10 Nov,"The official policy of Salvation Army is no discrimination; but as Yogi Berra said, ""In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is."" The actions of some Salvation Army facilities or programs have differed from their official policy. Their history in this is not great. We'll have to see if these facilities live up to their word."
9,167403966,ernie s.,• University Neighbors,10 Nov,"False comparison. I’m actually truth the SA does, in fact, serve all. Really, you should try it yourself."
10,167403966,Peter M.,• Baker,10 Nov,"Right, so in a world where needs are great for many of the weakest, endeavor to shut down organizations such as the Salvation Army and Catholic Charities, cancel them, and then send cards to all of those who they have and would have continued providing assistance to, expressing * how sorry you all are for facilitating their continued struggle, but they weren't fair to everyone, according to the expectations of many ,who so often need little help in the same way, at all. *"
11,167403966,Rick G.,• Bear Valley West,10 Nov,How many times does it take me unsubscribing when it actually works…
12,167403966,Heather Doolittle,• Mayfair,10 Nov,"Rick G. I was wondering the same thing! Apparently, now that next-door is curating their own content, they subscribed everyone to it. If you go to your settings, you can unsubscribe from all of this junk."
13,167403966,Peter M.,• Baker,10 Nov,"...or just click the down arrow in the upper right of the post field, and click 'turn off notifications', and then again to click ""hide post'."
14,167403966,Jeff H.,• University Hills,10 Nov,"The SA Handbook of Doctrine includes some passages that cite a portion of the Bible (Romans 1:18-32), which advocates for the exclusion, in the tamest sense, to the killing of LGBTQ people, in the extreme interpretation. The Salvation Army is not an inclusive organization."
15,167403966,ernie s.,• University Neighbors,10 Nov,Totally untrue and a simple google search uncovers this fabrication to anyone who actually cares about inclusion. 
16,167403966,Florence Sebern,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,10 Nov,"What about the Johnson and Wales Campus? 25 acres, turnkey ready, for homeless and transitional housing, and currently for sale. The City says they are committed to this issue, but then depends on other organizations. An additional $41M tax measure was just passed. Seems like more ""talk"" and less ""walk."""
17,167403966,Steve K.,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,10 Nov,"If it makes sense, the city looks the other way. If we had a ""perfect "" city, many people would probably loose their jobs."
18,167403966,Chloe Adams,• CBD,10 Nov,I literally know people who were kicked out of Salvation Army shelters for being trans. Their policy doesn’t necessarily align with their actions.

21,167403966,ernie s.,• University Neighbors,10 Nov,"Total BS. Spreading this type of lie is damaging to anyone and everyone who seeks shelter anywhere. By repeating these lies, you actually damage the challenge of inclusivity by building a straw man argument when there is plenty of actual discrimination taking place."
22,167403966,Chloe Adams,• CBD,10 Nov,Forgot to mention that you’re REQUIRED to pray before they’ll feed you https://mobile.twitter.com/kivanbay/status/934607972415631360
23,167403966,Peter M.,• Baker,23w,"What then, a person gets help on their own terms, w/o any thankfulness for that help?  Should they pray to you?  Honestly, if I were hungry, and in Iran, and for food, for a meal, I was asked to pray to Allah, I would, from my lips, but not my heart, which is the issue; I wouldn't take it personally."
24,167403966,J Kendel J.,• University Neighbors,23w,"In my experience, any attempt to help is usually grounded in good intentions. The Salvation Army might set policy to be inclusive, but that doesn't mean that a lot of practicing Christians within their organization might not behave in unwelcoming, discriminating or other hurtful ways."
25,167403966,Peter D.,• Bear Valley East,10 Nov,"The Salvation Army serves all people regardless of their faith, sexual orientation, gender, or any other issue.

26,167403966,Lois D.,• Hampden Heights North,10 Nov,"From my experience when I lived in southern California, the Salvation Army did much good for all of society, providing immunizations, helping cloth and feed the poor etc. I was not religious the thirty years while living there and had no personal experience directly with them other than to get a pneumonia shot and annual flu shots. Everything I heard about the organization was good. I think we currently live in an age where it is considered cool to criticize and tear down everything that has been good."
27,167403966,Debby Myers,• Congress Park,10 Nov,Check out their website they have a page for LGBTQ support.
28,167403966,William M.,• Cook Park,23w,"The Salvation Army has done great things. If you don't like them don't go and don't donate. But some Radical Haters would rather Salvation Army close and let the Thousand upon thousands they help with food, clothing, shelter, safety, mental help, and love wonder the streets.(edited)"
29,167403966,ernie s.,• University Neighbors,10 Nov,This dragging of the SA happens every year about this time. Folks like to think they are commanding the High Moral Ground when they are actually just showing how easily they can be mislead☹️
30,167403966,William M.,• Cook Park,23w,"The best way to find out about the Salvation Army is to get off your duff and get a first hand experience! Walk amongst those who need help. The poor, the homeless, and the needy! Holidays are here and they could use volunteers! You will meet some of the finest humble and compassionate people working there. The ""Customers"" are people from all walks of life. Most were living fine lives till disaster hit. Some didn't choose life to go bad, but sometimes it finds them. Others live the drug life even though they were from privileged life! They need help, and the volunteer at Salvation Army, or any other place like them, can provide tremendous help by just listening. Volunteer, and they will find something for you to do. Don't be one of the privileged who has never done anything but sit home and complain about things you have NO experience with. Don't be a complainer - be a supporter!(edited)"
31,167403966,Andie K.,• Mar Lee,10 Nov,"This is awesome! The salvation army does so much good. I can't say enough about what they do for people. And not only what they do, but how they educate, help and build people up from thier lowest points in life. From our experience with out discrimination,  or judgement. God has blessed with having them in our lives, and hope to be able to give and help someone in need."
32,167403966,Nancy M.,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,11 Nov,Agreed!  So happy to hear about this!
0,171255170,Michelle Edgar,• Windsor East,18w,My car was broken into last year. And ealier this year we caught someone breaking into my father inlaws car (the ridge at Lowry apartments)(edited)
1,171255170,Laurel Watson,• Lowry,18 Dec,Ah! Scary!
2,171255170,Pavel Yudanov,• Lowry,18 Dec,"Yup, last month, exactly the same situation at Pilot House. Break ins happens everyday day in Pilot house  and neighboring apartments."
3,171255170,Laurel Watson,• Lowry,18 Dec,Do you think it’s from people who live in the area? Creepy. Why break in twice? I hope I’m not being watched. It’s unnerving.
4,171255170,Leatrice Johnson,• Woodside Village,18 Dec,I live in woodside village. Right off Fairmount. No break ins that I have heard of. Sorry this has happened to you
5,171255170,Nicole Sheehan,• Woodside Village,19 Dec,I live here too and this exact thing happened to me but I’m 90% sure my boyfriend left the car unlocked.
6,171255170,Deb Fenton,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,18 Dec,My car window along with someone else’s was smashed at Lowry Sports Park in the middle of the day a few weeks ago. Police reports were filed. Sadly a common occurrence.
7,171255170,Laurel Watson,• Lowry,18 Dec,Yikes! It makes me so angry. Very violating.
8,171255170,Scott Bulfin,• Central Park,18 Dec,"Also happens in Central Park....usually looking for change or anything else they can steal and pawn. Video doorbells show it is teens. Make sure you always lock your doors and garage doors are closed and not left open, even during day. Bikes are common things stolen out of garages."
9,171255170,Chuck Huls,• East Washington Virginia Vale,18 Dec,and remember never leave the garage door opener in your car
10,171255170,Julie Heinz,• Windsor North,18 Dec,Hey Laurel! My car was broken into last night and same situation- went through everything and all they took was a change purse I keep in there with maybe $2 in it. I live in the condos right near fairmont and alameda.
11,171255170,Laurel Watson,• Lowry,19 Dec,wow!! I’m so sorry! I wonder if it was the same person.
12,171255170,Christine Fox,• Windsor North,19 Dec,When you all say break in- it would help to get more detail.  How are they usually breaking in?  Breaking windows?    Do they have a way  to open locked car doors?  Or are they breaking into garages where cars are unlocked?  Thanks
13,171255170,Christine Fox,• Windsor North,19 Dec,And do car alarms help?
14,171255170,Scott Bulfin,• Central Park,19 Dec,yes...new cars they don't break into in Central Park I have noticed.
15,171255170,Roger Fang,• Alton Park,17w,Car alarms are useless. They popped (and bent) my hood to disconnect my alarm and were able to jimmy the lock to get in without breaking the window. They also destroyed the steering column to hotwire it. This happened a few years ago and I use a steering wheel lock now. Car thefts have been increasing in recent years and break-ins even more in the past year(s) as everyone is reporting on ND.(edited)
16,171255170,Jessica Watson,• Tava Waters,19 Dec,Someone broke out window and stole our stereo. In broad daylight in front of our apt. Then there was a huge surge in car thefts they thought they got a group of people so this is probably someone new. I know tava is a great place for crime just a huge area of cars with no security or cameras.
17,171255170,Laurel Watson,• Lowry,19 Dec,"I’m so sorry!! That’s awful. Yeah, other people in my complex have had it happen to them too."
18,171255170,Mark Donovan,• Historic Montclair,19 Dec,Same thing happened to my girlfriends car parked in the driveway on Pontiac St. near 6th about two weeks ago.  She might have left it unlocked accidentally as the window was not broken.  They rifled through everything.  They also took off a panel under the steering column as if the were considering hot wiring.  Do people still do that with new cars?  I am sorry that you also had this experience Laurel.
19,171255170,Dennis Duffy,• Lyn Knoll,19 Dec,"The Club 3000 is 19.00 on Amazon , at least they will perhaps see it on your steering wheel and move on to next car. I bought one for every vehicle and am pleased."
20,171255170,Ken J.,• Rangeview,19 Dec,The thieves are not only looking for valuables but items that can be used for ID theft and also garage door openers for future home burgleries.
21,171255170,Melicya Candelaria,• Lowry,19 Dec,I locked myself out of my car a few weeks back and I was surprised how easy it was for the lock Smith to open my door. I have a lexus and thought it was safer but nope! It doesn't matter how new your car is.
22,171255170,Eden Powell,• South Park Hill,19 Dec,Time for a camera
23,171255170,Dennis Duffy,• Lyn Knoll,19 Dec,"Problem with camera is you get to see who is doing it but police won't do a thing, I think car alarms and mean dogs are better."
24,171255170,Leenah Ali,• Legends at Lowry,19 Dec,Two cars have been stolen from Renaissance at Lowry boulevard in the last week and an attempted car theft. My rental car was stolen from Parker and Florida while I was visiting my friend 2 weeks ago.... literally was upstairs 10 minutes had the doors locked and keys in hand. They’re getting crafty and desperate
25,171255170,Jeff Carlisle-Tierno,• Hale,19 Dec,That’s everyday shit anymore. I work a late swing shift at my regular job and get back very late. Pretty common to run up on someone peeking into car windows or even in the middle of trying to break into a car or garage. Had someone pull a knife on me when I walked into the building’s courtyard as they were trying to steal bikes from the rack. 
26,171255170,Christi Palitto,• Historic Montclair,19 Dec,"I did. I posted photos, sounds exactly the same."
27,171255170,Laurel Watson,• Lowry,19 Dec,Wow! I’m so sorry.
28,171255170,Christi Palitto,• Historic Montclair,19 Dec,2 weeks ago
29,171255170,Julie Heinz,• Windsor North,19 Dec,Atleast he’s wearing a mask 😂🤷‍♀️
30,171255170,Christi Palitto,• Historic Montclair,19 Dec,"😆 see, there’s an upside to everything."
31,171255170,Kenith B.,• Havana,19 Dec,All the time I'm havanna Mexico area and had two vehicles about stolen stole a title and broke the ignition as soon as I brought it home and my other truck about a month ago broke ignition cops are useless In this matter
0,169002157,Katie Lindenberg,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,26 Nov,"Laurie, we are bringing our leftovers to a motel housing homeless people. The All Inn Motel on Colfax. They have 40 residents in need of dinners and would sure appreciate the extra food!"
1,169002157,Laurie Kagan,• Lowry,26 Nov,"Katie,  can you give me any more information? Should I bring individually made up plates? Should I bring containers of different sides and sliced turkey? Any help would be appreciated. If you have the time to call me or text me that would be great. Also, is it too late to go now?"
2,169002157,Laurie Kagan,• Lowry,28 Nov,I went over Thanksgiving night with six dinners and someone else had already been there. I presume that was Katie. They turned me away saying they didn’t need it. It does not appear that people would have the capacity to cook in their rooms. It is a motel.
3,169002157,Gregory Clark,• Mayfair,28 Nov,"Very kind of you to try.  Good work, thank you for caring!"
4,169002157,Katie Lindenberg,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,28 Nov,Wow I am so sorry!! I can’t believe they didn’t keep the dinners. Thank you for trying. That was so very kind of you.
0,168704457,Michell LeDoux,• East Colfax,24 Nov,Can i get the address please
1,168704457,Maggie Gourd-Barrett,• South Park Hill,25 Nov,Address please?
2,168704457,Deborah Howitt,• Central Park,25 Nov,"I will send the address via private message, thanks!"
3,168704457,Kathleen Fallon,• Central Park,25 Nov,Dropped off 2 bags for you. Did you receive?  Rang bell. No answer.
4,168704457,Deborah Howitt,• Central Park,25 Nov,"Yes I received them, I didn’t answer the door because I was on a conference call for work.  Thank you so much!"
5,168704457,Kathleen Fallon,• Central Park,25 Nov,"Sorry. Being retired, I am still learning about all these things. TU 4 doing this."
0,171863816,Matthew Conn,• Berkeley-Regis,26 Dec,This is the most important thing that needs to be said and it's not hateful but constructive criticism
0,175820513,Ed Heath,• Central Park,3 Feb,"I've lived in CP for 8 years and have never felt fearful to be out at night. I rarely shop anywhere after dinner. Before Covid, I usually ate out 4-5x/wk. Now I cook or do carryout"
1,175820513,Jim Winski,• Central Park,3 Feb,"I think that COVID has a lot to do with this. I also used to go out to dinner, movies, etc. often but not right now."
2,175820513,Chrissy Carlson,• Central Park,3 Feb,"I just moved here a couple months ago and feel like this when I go on walks at night. Like, where is everyone? Coming from Cap Hill, it’s been quite an adjustment."
3,175820513,J. D. M.,• Central Park,3 Feb,"we live near the dog park/tennis courts, and I have to say, there's ALWAYS people out around here. In the summer there were people playing tennis far into the night, and even now there's people on the pathway all throughout the day. Probably helps that you can walk from this part of the neighborhood all the way to Stanley Marketplace, all the way up to the Sand Creek Trail. Check out the trails, they're really a great part of the Neighborhood."
4,175820513,Karen Garvey,• Central Park,3 Feb,"Um, COVID. Ordinarily restaurants are jammed. In non-COVID times, some restaurants struggled, but quite a few have been around a long time & did great. It's never going to be Cap Hill. There shops, restaurants are interspersed with homes/apartments. Not so here."
5,175820513,Chrissy Carlson,• Central Park,3 Feb,Totally. I guess I was surprised by the lack of folks just out walking dogs even.
6,175820513,Veronica Barahona - Ziegler,• Central Park,3 Feb,"I have lived here since 2005 and it was always busy. Covid has changed everything. Farmers market , beer festival, the Christmas lighting, movies at the park, it was just busy. Covid ruined everything"
7,175820513,Omar Cisneros,• Central Park,3 Feb,I feel like people now days are such individualist that they don’t bother to communicate with neighbors or people waking by or in general. This can cause plenty of separation especially with Covid.
8,175820513,Veronica Barahona - Ziegler,• Central Park,3 Feb,Agree! But the reason why that happens is because other people have ruined it. So to avoid any issues people dont talk to other people.  Me for example I have bumped into a few unfriendly people and now I just don't acknowledge anybody until they smile or say hi to me first.
9,175820513,Alejandra Zepeda de Duflos,• Central Park,3 Feb,"I don't think we have that problem in North End. Maybe because we are all new to the area. People are very friendly and we know most people on our street. We definetly need a bar, restaurant or coffee shop on this side. We only have a Taco Bell and a Panda Express."
10,175820513,Louann Bernstone,• Central Park,4 Feb,agree
11,175820513,Helen Berkman,• Central Park,3 Feb,"I’ve lived here for 10 years and it’s always been pretty dead in the winter. Around May 1st though, everyone comes out of the woodwork almost overnight (except for 2020). I hope if we get enough folks vaccinated it’ll be like that again. It’s never been a nightlife neighborhood though."
12,175820513,Cindi Mathers,• Beeler Park,3 Feb,"When we  moved here from St Louis 2 1/2 years ago, I was shocked at how early everything in Central Park closed down. Restaurants, the mall, shops,  Stanley Market, etc. I never quite got that."
13,175820513,Michael Baca,• Central Park,3 Feb,This is exactly what I am talking about and while many people like that there is no nightlife I think the community needs it.
14,175820513,Victoria Whitley,• Central Park,11w,Restaurant scene is not astounding and bars are basically nonexistent. Downtown is so close and accessible. I’d rather drive 15 minutes downtown to go to a fantastic restaurant than drive 5 minutes to go to a decent restaurant for convenience. I also drive extra just to go to Trader Joe’s. 
15,175820513,Michael Baca,• Central Park,3 Feb,"I want to clarify that I realize COVID-19 is a temporary cause, but even before COVID-19 this community has struggled to have life to it in the evening or a nightlife."
16,175820513,Ty Rheem,• South Park Hill,4 Feb,"Now that it’s no longer Stapleton, I’d expect some changes. But I doubt Sprouts will ever be a place to get your groove on at night."
17,175820513,Michael Baca,• Central Park,4 Feb,Thanks for trying to insult me.
18,175820513,Melisa Jaenisch,• Central Park,4 Feb,"Michael Baca Don't take it personally ;-)  I don't think he meant it a bad way ;-) Just joking around ;-) Probably don't want to measure the nightlife of a place by the number of people at Sprouts in the evening. Although that would probably be my pace. I am more likely to be outdoors weather permitting. Since COVID19 and social distancing i am definitely more hesitant to approach people I don't already know. That said, I have met a few new neighbors. Hopefully things will pick up again as the weather gets nicer."
19,175820513,Marc Duflos,• Central Park,4 Feb,Winter + pandemic
20,175820513,Burt Keems,• Central Park,9w,"Honestly we don’t have a centralized top-shelf bar/entertainment area like so many other communities in the Denver Metro area. We tried the Punch Bowl Social experiment, didn’t work. The Shops at Northfield need to be severely updated. I mean we need places like the Alamo Draft House or the Rino Beer Garden, or even a place like the Bitto Bistro wine bar in Westminster (great place by the way). There needs to be an outside bar/tapas place where adults can be respected as adults and have the ability to walk freely with a cup of beer or wine outside and enjoy themselves in Central Park. You know like Bourbon Street or the Vegas Strip, see article: https://www.liquor.com/articles/drinking-in-public/. With the amount of high-income families around here you think something like that would already be in the works. But I do get that there are a lot of young families here and you got this whole Pandemic thing that we can’t forget, but maybe one day in the future.(edited)"
21,175820513,Angie Berens,• Central Park,4 Feb,What about Stanley?
22,175820513,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,4 Feb,COVID-19 is the reason.  Things will improve once 70-80% of us are vaccinated.
23,175820513,Susie Moniot,• Central Park,4 Feb,I agree with those saying it’s because of COVID. There is a huge difference right now in how many things are going on in the evenings. I also think there is more of that in the warmer months.
24,175820513,Drew Rudolph,• East Colfax,4 Feb,I dunno lol. I think that downtown and colfax has the best night life. 
25,175820513,Linda Wiggins,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Feb,Isn't there a 10pm curfew for Denver because of Covid-19?
26,175820513,Michael Baca,• Central Park,4 Feb,In am not talking about COVID-19. I was at Sprouts at 8 pm on a Tuesday night and was the only one in the store. If I went to the Sprouts on Colfax there would be 30-40 people in the store.
27,175820513,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,4 Feb,"Central Park was designed for families living together , not night life.  If you want close by nightlife there are all the Los, (Lodo, Hido)  Rhino, Riverfront and downtown."

20,166693737,Margo Clark,• Morris Heights,6 Nov,Hummmm I would think though by him saying she’s mute...maybe someone who signs can try to see if she communicates that way and will trust them a bit more 😬 ugh breaks my heart

If no one steps up for him, you might look for a Husky rescue group in the area. He looks like a beautiful charmer, who definitely deserves to spend the rest of his years in a loving home. Thank you for fostering, ànd good luck!"
9,174505491,Kathleen Hatsell,• Central Park,22 Jan,"Very kind, I think he will find his forever home soon, he is such a good dog. In the meantime, he has us. I agree, he misses his family but he is still sweet and loving."

I adopted my toothless, 10 yr old, homeless cat w/early kidney disease (🥶) from the Dumb Friends League 1 yr ago.

13,174505491,Ann Burke,• South Park Hill,22 Jan,Does Evergreen Animal Protective League do courtesy posts? You already knew this baby would love Evergreen! That’s a great idea
14,174505491,Angel Acosta,• Montbello,22 Jan,Actually EAPL has foster families in many cities within the state.  I knew a few families who fostered for them in Denver and Littleton.

0,177293056,Susan Clyne,• Northglenn Marketplace,16 Feb,I went by Mountain View Automotive and paid the diagnostic fee. This is a 1994 Ford Ranger truck that Roy uses to pick up metal recycling. I know several persons on Next Door have used him and speak highly of him. He needs at least $700 to get the initial phase done. The total cost is $2000. I hope everyone can pitch in a little to get him back on the road helping us all get rid of our scrap while being self supporting.

0,181607435,Kathryn Lind,• Del Mar Parkway,28 Mar,"It may be worthwhile to talk to the liquor shop owners/workers and acknowledge the problem. They’re surely aware of the mess but so far, likely no one has cared. If they’re aware it’s on people’s radar they may add tidying up to their opening/closing duties, especially if they know people are irritated enough to try to change zoning."
1,181607435,Christopher Belila,• Aurora Arts District,28 Mar,Kathryn....that's a great idea but outside of me pissing people off by asking the question I don't see many people being that concerned.  My comment is more concern that we have a store that is bad for our neighborhood.  The thing that is disheartening is that few people care.

7,172404863,Will M.,• Cook Park,16w,"Since the Federal Reserve Act our monetary system cannot run without debt. There can never be enough currency to pay back what is owed because Central Banks take a 6% cut, and because of interest owed on money borrowed. If we cut 100% of all spending and collected 100% of the money supply in taxes, we still couldn't pay off the debt. This is why the US Dollar was worth 26 times more in 1913 than it is today. Every time money is printed, the value of money in existence decreases. It's a form of stealth taxation and wealth redistribution that also pays Central Banks for doing nothing but creating ones and zeros in a bank processing system. The appeal is that it's easy money for politicians to spend, makes anyone close to the money creation richer, and it's very hard for the voting public to see or understand. Printing money and giving it to other countries is redistributing wealth from anyone who earns a living in USD or saves in it while paying other countries and Central Banks (who always get their cut).(edited)"

10,172404863,Carol Summerlin,• Windsor Gardens East,1 Jan,"Well, it sounds like I’m the only one torn on this minimum wage increase. I don’t know who it applies to. All I know is that many businesses had to close their doors in 2020, and some are barely hanging on. How is this wage increase going to help them?  If it pushes them over the edge, it hurts us all. Fewer businesses, higher unemployment, higher taxes, more folks out of work. So my question is, why now?  Why not 3-4 years ago when the economy was thriving?  This just doesn’t make sense to me."

You do realize that when that happens, a McDonalds burger is going to cost $15, a soda will be $8, fries will be $10, a movie theater ticket will be $25. To raise minimum wage salaries for minimum wage workers puts everyone in jeopardy to ill afford even the simplest things in life. If you can’t afford to live on minimum wage jobs get an education or go to tech school. Minimum wage jobs were established for a reason. They used to be jobs that teenagers got or college students or people that wanted to subsidize another income. They were never meant to support a full-time living wage."
16,172404863,Brittany Cooper,• Lowry,2 Jan,"I have a question. There is a provision in this bill (from when it was raised to $12.80 in Jan 2020)  that allowed an exception for un-emancipated minors to make less, if the business (such as part time seasonal work) was certified to offer some sort of life skill. However, the process to qualify a business as such did not, and to my understanding still does not exist. So there really is no exception despite the law mandating one. I have reached out to many people on this issue for close to a year now with no answer as to when businesses can be certified, because again, the process doesn’t exist. Any enlightenment is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance."

I know you all don’t want to hear this, but Trump, pre pandemic, was making inroads to a thriving economy, creating thousands of new jobs, and wage increases were following. Too bad he doesn’t get another 4 years to maintain that trajectory."
22,172404863,Frank H.,• Baker,2 Jan,"Xcel energy and Denver water cut their employees by over 250. Now they have one person driving by the property to take the electric reading of 20,000 meters and Denver water the same. how many hundreds of thousands of dollars did these companies save by going to electronic meters. Where do you imagine the homeless people came from? They came from companies downsizing so they have no job, house, car, family, etc."
23,172404863,Sean Gallagher,• Washington Virginia Vale,16w,Blame the people at the top who expect the rest of us to supplement their overpaid salaries! When are they going to tighten their belts?(edited)
24,172404863,Frank H.,• Baker,2 Jan,Any company who can put hundreds and millions of dollars into the Olympics advertising makes way too much money.
25,172404863,Carol Summerlin,• Windsor Gardens East,2 Jan,I was sickened by the amount of money poured into election campaigning.
26,172404863,Ilma R.,• Alamo Placita,15w,"Frank Haas I might guess them being behind on rent might be more related to the pandemic unless they’ve been behind for over a year... Also, minimum wage was $9 in 2017. Has your rent stayed the same for the last 3 yrs? when the cost of gas, groceries, rent, and education go up then it would only make sense that the minimum wage would need to go up as well. If heads of large companies would stop overcharging for everything just to overfill their own pockets then the rest of us could continue affording the basics. Stop blaming the regular working man for struggling to play a game created by the rich to benefit the rich.(edited)"

0,173823931,Roseann Brown,• East Colfax,14 Jan,Not mine he is a very pretty boy though. If he is chipped you can take him to the DDFL or I believe any animal clinic and they can find his family.
1,173823931,Liz Samioglou,• East Colfax,14 Jan,That’s a great idea!! Thank you! Do you think I need to make an appointment to check his chip? I’m honestly nervous to pick him up and put him in a carrier
2,173823931,Roseann Brown,• East Colfax,14 Jan,Put some food in it. That way at least you can find out if the cat has a family.
3,173823931,Roseann Brown,• East Colfax,14 Jan,Put food in the carrier.
4,173823931,Roseann Brown,• East Colfax,14 Jan,Does he seem feral?
5,173823931,Liz Samioglou,• East Colfax,14w,"Honestly no, that’s why i thought he had a family, he is so trusting and seems happy to see me, comes right. Up to me when I’m outside, he seems plump like someone else might be feeding him . I might give it two days to see if anyone has been missing him and then try and get him to a clinic because he seems so nice now but getting him in a carrier might be a different story(edited)"
6,173823931,Toni Amicarella,• North Park Hill,14 Jan,Thanks for helping him
7,173823931,Deb Fenton,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,14 Jan,Poor guy. Let me know if you need any help with a carrier and getting him to a vet or rescue to see if he’s chipped!
8,173823931,elise zepelin,• Lowry,14 Jan,Please try to get this kitty to a safe place.You could try taking it to the ddfl.
9,173823931,elise zepelin,• Lowry,14 Jan,You might even be able to borrow a trap that he'll go into and then take him to the ddfl that way If course I mean a humane trap. There are the kinds that if you baut with food he'll go into and then the door will close. Maybe an animal shelter or organization like that and maybe even the ddfl can loan you one.
10,173823931,Liz Samioglou,• East Colfax,14 Jan,Thank you! Great advice! I will call the dumb friends league or another clinic if no one claims him on here
11,173823931,elise zepelin,• Lowry,14 Jan,You might also want to check lost animal sites to see if someone is missing him.Thanks for your kindness
12,173823931,Kathleen McChesney,• Lowry,15 Jan,"Are you sure this is a male?  If plump but hungry, it may be a pregnant female.  Either way, thank you for helping the poor kitty!"
13,173823931,Terri Mc,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,15 Jan,Any vet can scan for a chip

16,173823931,Alyssa Gabriel,• South Park Hill,15 Jan,This may be the same cat we saw on our camera the other night. We are 22nd and Jasmine. If we see them again we will try to take them in to get scanned for a micro chip
17,173823931,Jane Skarka,• Mayfair,15 Jan,"Please take the cat to a shelter. They don’t need to be sleeping in a crawl space. If the cat belongs to someone, they can surely find them there. The important thing is to get the cat to a safe place."
18,173823931,Liz Samioglou,• East Colfax,15 Jan,I’m working on that lady I also can’t just pick up a random cat  with who knows what kind of temperament when handling and throw it in my car I haven’t even seen the cat today just posted on here hoping to reconnect with the cats family but thank you
19,173823931,Kacey Mathews,• East Colfax,15 Jan,"The DFL will check to see if the cat has a chip & if the cat does, they’ll contact the owner’s based on the information given on the chip."
20,173823931,Liz Samioglou,• East Colfax,15 Jan,I know! Thanks!
21,173823931,LInda Poletti,• South Park Hill,16 Jan,I bet there is someone who could lend you a crate and then you could put the food inside the crate next time which would be a really easy way to trap him/her.  And then DDFL or another shelter could take it from there.  Thank you for your kindness Liz!
0,169841811,Carol Giambri,• Church Ranch Blvd,5 Dec,I am so excited that this group has given you the opportunity to move forward. Thanks for the update.

2,168827271,Shannon Henderson,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,"Yeah, I think there’s a good chance she might have helped herself to some of our things if we weren’t home. But, it was clear she didn’t want to harm us. "

6,168827271,Chuck H L.,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,Wow. We had that happened two weeks ago.  A lady started a fire behind our house. She left a mess and said she was cold. She had a bag too. Scary I saw here with my video camera and the neighbors called me right away.
7,168827271,Shannon Henderson,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,Yikes! I hope the fire was in a fire pit!

10,168827271,Shannon Henderson,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,"I don’t think the fire dept has any authority to arrest? Also, arresting is probably not going to stop her behavior, they’ll just detain her for a day or so and then she’ll be right back out doing the same stuff."
11,168827271,Chuck H L.,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,Shannon Henderson I didn't state the FD was called to arrest here. My concern was clearly the fire.
12,168827271,Maria A. Garcia,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,25 Nov,Wow that is nuts!!!What a crazy night in the area last night! On Lansing and Montview there was a drive by shooting 🙄i think it was road rage that ended in front of our house. God please protect us!

15,168827271,Sarah Pryor,• Montbello,25 Nov,"We had something like that happen once - we forgot to lock the door and very, very late that night, my son heard a disturbance.  It was a very drunk girl, coming through the front door, saying she had to get to the bathroom.  She got to the bathroom, but there was quite a mess made.....My son, who can be a very compassionate guy tried to talk with her.  She thought she was at home.  He offered to drive her home and sure enough, her house was around the corner and did look exactly like our.....:-)"
16,168827271,Shannon Henderson,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,28 Nov,That happened to my sister two different times after she moved into a house next to a college that used to be the lacrosse house. Drunk lacrosse boys tried to break in because they forgot their didn’t live there anymore haha

23,168827271,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,26 Nov,Well I'm glad nobody died. Death is not the solution.
24,168827271,Janelle Miller,• Aurora,27 Nov,Thank God everyone was okay and she a was willing to leave without argument!
25,168827271,Sarah Pryor,• Montbello,28 Nov,"Yes, and I slept through the whole thing....she was very drunk and not at all combative.  If she had been, I imagine my son would have handled the situation differently."

1,169919213,Heather MacPhail,• Montbello,6 Dec,Should want to deal with it. Don't get one if you can't love and respect an animal.
2,169919213,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,6 Dec,ALL dogs are so loving I can’t imagine how much it breaks their hearts to be given up. Every dog I’ve ever had has gotten it’s forever home when it goes home with me. I can’t imagine what could ever make me give a dog up. They are family. 💕I would be lost and heartbroken without them
3,169919213,Drew Rudolph,• East Colfax,6 Dec,It’s really sad to see people get pets and treat them as disposable. 
4,169919213,Vanessa Marlyn V Watkins,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Dec,"What!!! Please let me know more info. I promise I won't stop till that poor pup is taken and those cats get the help they need. Do you know what the pitbull looks like, do you have any update on the pitbull?"
5,169919213,Carol Summerlin,• Windsor Gardens East,6 Dec,"Your post makes a lot of sense. However, many people get their pets on the spur of the moment, or as a surprise, or as a “cute” factor. They don’t have the love and devotion factor required to be good pet parents. Once they realize they’ve made a mistake, I think it is better to give them to a new owner. The reason is that these people will never be the good pet parent that they need to be. They obviously are not willing to make the sacrifices required to be a pet owner. These unwanted pets will be treated as “disposable” as Drew Rudolph mentions above. "
6,169919213,Vanessa Marlyn V Watkins,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Dec,So if I get knocked up and I decide changing diapers is too much I'll be sure to rehome it.
7,169919213,Donna Latino,• Windsor Gardens East,6 Dec,"Well said, Ms. Watkins!!! These wonderful creatures bring unconditional love and happiness to many of us. They are not disposable! My felines  have been nothing but a blessing to me since I found my first kitty in 1978. People need to think before buying or adopting any pet."
8,169919213,Kathy Kosednar,• Washington Virginia Vale,6 Dec,"AMEN!  Maybe people should volunteer at a shelter where they will witness many cats and dogs being surrendered because “I’m allergic, we’re moving, he/she sheds”.  Pets have feelings and seeing them left at a shelter is heartbreaking.  Shelter volunteers save those abandoned pets because they are the ones who give emotional support and socialization so they can find a new home.  Please THINK before you adopt a pet."

Chewed most of my furniture, destroyed every new toy, ate everything in site.  Now, she’s approaching 14 and still stubborn, demanding and the love of my life❤️ I would take a bullet for my baby girl dog!"

Diamond won't eat her raw chicken like the others because she wants it cooked. Spartacus is a grumpy old man. Meliha is definitely Uhtred's twin in every way. They all have temper tantrums, which I never knew they could have. They all talk back and have become really good at ignoring me.(edited)"

I can imagine our life without our baby girl who we literally just rescued. Here's a few photos of her before and after.

17,169919213,Chelsea Lavelle,• Aurora,6 Dec,Perfectly said. There is nothing that breaks my heart more than humans who don’t take care of their pets. I would do absolutely ANYthing for my fur babies and can’t imagine life without them.

19,169919213,Isabel Jamaica,• DIA,19w,"I understand your life devotion to animals, but don’t compare dogs to babies, judge people who have made the hard decision of letting go of their pet, or invalidate the reasons for them doing so. It’s not your business and people prioritize differently. It’s not your place to preach on different lifestyles/choices.(edited)"
20,169919213,Carol Summerlin,• Windsor Gardens East,6 Dec,"Isabel Jamaica. You’re absolutely right. Human babies have a higher priority than fur babies. But fur babies are Gods creation too, and people do need to be more willful and mindful before adopting a pet. There are certainly many exceptions of people having no other choice. But as mentioned in the article, there are far tooooooo many people “impulse” shopping, and these poor animals face trauma also. And it’s hard not to judge folks when you look at shelters full of unloved, abused, neglected animals. God loves all His creation and puts man in charge of their well being. We need to take that responsibility seriously."

28,169919213,Vanessa Marlyn V Watkins,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Dec,"Thank you for sharing! If it wasn't for my mom renting me one of her homes I'd be packing and moving back to Texas.  I've had a hard time finding a place with my dogs and I was ready to sleep in my car at that time. This was when they all got along, I've thought about what I would do if something happens and we have no home.... I honestly have no clue. I do know that I would figure out something no matter what. It's hard at times, sometimes I worry about feeding them or being able to pay for vet bills. Omgggg and endless amounts of laundry,  poopie butts getting poo everywhere,  the mud and dirt🥺, the rotating so they don't kill each other and their little attitudes have aged me these last 3 years but I wouldn't have it any other way. I always tell them I'm taken them to the pound if they don't stop giving me crazy hairs 🤣 but they know that'll never ever happen.  They really are little humans in a dogs body. They know exactly what to do to get what they want. They know who will give them goodies and who won't. They always make sure mommy is around the corner before asking dad for a treat since I'm not looking. They know when I'm upset and how to make it all better. Their so thankful, forgiving, loyal and the unconditional love is like nothing I've ever had💞."
29,169919213,Joycelyn Jaggers,• Green Valley Ranch,6 Dec,"Ms. Watkins, I couldn’t agree with you more. I am so often dumbfounded by the number of rehoming posts on this and other apps. Growing up, my parents insisted we had pets to teach us responsibility. I did the same with my daughter. It is troubling that grown people don’t have the foresight to consider the commitment associated with having a companion pet.  What’s worse to me is, having a pet you don’t want and rather than give it to a family who would give it a great home, they want to sell it to whoever will take it. It sometimes makes me question the true ownership of the pet. Especially since a friend’s pet was stolen and a month later showed up on Craigslist for rehoming. Luckily, we contacted the police and when I went to purchase the dog the police were waiting.  Once we confirmed the identity the culprits were arrested for concealing stolen property."
30,169919213,Vanessa Marlyn V Watkins,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Dec,You would think people would learn by now. I wish there was a way to decreasing the number of irresponsible people. One post I see all the time is where they left puppies outside and they end up stolen.... I know we should be able to leave our dogs in our yards without having to worry but reality is we can't. How many post do we have to see of dogs going missing before we stop leaving them outside alone? It's like parents leaving their kids and dogs in a hot car and they end up dying. I hear excuse after excuse. I'm sick of it. I'm glad you guys found your friends dog. I just saw a post where a litter of puppies were stolen and they found one clinging to life after being tortured. Thankfully the puppy is alive and recovering.

33,169919213,Carol Sweet,• Green Valley Ranch,6 Dec,"I agree. It’s always been foolish to purchase a pet as a Christmas gift. A pet is not a novelty, like a toy, to be discarded when it’s lost it’s appeal."

6,162206217,Michael Grosso,• Congress Park,24 Sep,Pitbulls are the most lovable dogs ever. They are only mean if they have mean owners. Just like humans are born to love and learn but are then taught to hate and be racist. You can't label a breed

10,162206217,Scott Hughes,• Hale,25 Sep,"""[On May 8, 1989, 59-year old] Rev. Wilbur Billingsley left his house at 20th Avenue and Emerson Street through a back alley on the way to pick up some groceries. His daughter, Michelle Billingsley, told Denverite that her mother started to worry when he didn’t promptly return. She poked her head into the alley and found him on the ground, badly bleeding and still being mauled by a neighbor’s pit bull. It had jumped over the fence to attack him."
11,162206217,Jude Wolf,• South Park Hill,25 Sep,"do you realize that all breeds of dog can bite? Pit bulls have consistently scored above average as friendly dogs with the American Temperament Test. You listing times when people have been attacked by pitbulls proves nothing, it gives no information about the circumstances, if the dogs has been abused or not if they had have been fixed or not. I could list times when golden retrievers have killed someone. Any dog is capable of the circumstances are right. It’s a scary thought, but that’s why it is crucial to pass this law so abusive owners are held accountable and the dogs that are actually dangerous, can be helped so the community isn’t at risk. It has been proved time and time again that breed specific legislation does nothing to keep the community safe. It has cost denver millions of dollars to uphold and it punishes responsible owners and innocent dogs. Please do some more research before listing pit bull attacks. The media has extremely skewed the way we see dog attacks, I highly recommend watching Beyond the Myth, it is very eye opening. If you really are advocating for the safety of the city against dog attacks, you should support breed neutral legislation and realize that over 50 breeds of dogs have been involved in fatal attacks in the past few years, and banning pitties is just a temporary solution to a larger issue or irresponsible owners and over population. Just like in humans, the way a dog looks or what their genetics are, determines nothing in regards to"

15,162206217,Scott Hughes,• Hale,28 Sep,"Twenty years ago the founder of the ""People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals"" organization, Ingrid Newkirk, wrote an opinion piece that was published about pit-bulls and it created quite a stir since she was in favor of bans. The official position of the PETA organization is in support of bans on the animals to this day. https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20000127-2000-01-27-0001270085-story.html"

She is very specific on who her dogs go to and make sure They are well prepared for these dogs.

Statistics can be presented in misleading ways and that is evident here. I think there is ""confirmation bias"" present in the way that much of the available data was analyzed to start with and there are other parameters or circumstances (whether or not there was someone else there that could help, for example) to be taken into account for the information to be clarifying enough, considering what's at stake.

27,168668433,Emily Lefferts,• Aurora,25 Nov,"When I have extra money in the budget next I'll gladly hire Mike again - he mowed my lawn a while back and it looked great! He and Suzy are really friendly and not at all pushy (and friendly with my dog, which was nice - he's super protective when people we don't know come by the house). Hope an endorsement helps too!"
28,168668433,Michael Schmick Sr,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,25 Nov,Thank u so much we enjoy making customers happy God bless
29,168668433,Linda E.,• Sunny Vale,28 Nov,"Michael, you mentioned needing an old suv in trade for some work .. I would like to meet you and your wife to see if we can maybe arrange this.. ? Would need u to give me a call ASAP 303.885.1188. If I don’t answer, be sure to leave a message.. and a number to call you back. I have an older Ford Escape that runs good, that I’m trying to decide what to do with.."
30,168668433,Michael Schmick Sr,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,28 Nov,Just called and left a voicemail God Bless
31,168668433,Steph Creen,• Lowry,13 Dec,Michael Schmick Sr I left you a PM
0,163681364,Manizheh Patterson,• Del Mar North,6 Oct,You really must not have much to worry about🙄
1,163681364,Brooke Liposchak,• Del Mar Parkway,7 Oct,I think it is plenty to worry about. It is also a sexual offense too. He would have to register as Rex offender in some states if he were to be caught. That is disturbing and gross to relieve yourself on someone’s property! The person posting is a concerned citizen and there is ‘not much’ to say about you and your mind! I hope you realize that this IS WRONG!
2,163681364,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,7 Oct,They won't cite him unless they catch him in the act . You can tell the police but unless they actually see him doing it he will not get a ticket. I wouldn't be too concerned about it. There are other things to worry about in the world.
3,163681364,Ahuzinae Thomas,• Jasper,19 Oct,Not true
4,163681364,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,26w,Ahuzinae Thomas very true. the police cannot charge someone unless they've actually seen them do it in the act.  If you don't believe me call them and ask them. Perhaps that's not what you wanted to be but that's the way it is. We do not live by vigilante justice here. I know this is very important to you so you should call them and see if they will charge this poor man.(edited)
5,163681364,Leah Benner,• Del Mar Parkway,7 Oct,"“Getting someone cited” for taking a whiz? That’s pretty low. He likely had his back turned to you and wasn’t trying to be offensive. Putting someone on the sex offender registry because you saw his back while he peed? The registry WILL, without a doubt, ruin his life. While you unfortunately saw his back while he peed and your life will go on."
6,163681364,Janet Pethan,• Chambers Heights,7 Oct,OMG that is gross and if he couldn't wait he could have at least gone to a private place not on her fence. I would also report him if he came here!
7,163681364,Ahuzinae Thomas,• Jasper,19 Oct,Janet Pethan bushes alleys anything right but someone's fence is rude
8,163681364,Zachary Powers,• Chambers Heights,7 Oct,This was probably not worth trying to confront him. You have no idea how people will react. I would say just forget about it and continue living life.
9,163681364,Jessica Meadows,• Norfolk Glenn,7 Oct,"It’s funny how many are ok w some dude pulling it out and peeing out in the open. Gotta pee? At least duck around a corner, go find a tree, find a gas station 🙄"
10,163681364,Marty Connelly,• Apache Mesa,7 Oct,In no way is this okay. What happens when he decides to take a dump?
11,163681364,Lisa Ann Daniel,• Chambers Heights,7 Oct,Me too☹️
12,163681364,She Hoeppner,• Del Mar Parkway,7 Oct,It is not OK for many reason beside his urine can be contagious with several kinds of diseases. What streets was this on?
13,163681364,Roberto Nuñez,• Del Mar North,7 Oct,Ridiculous 😅🤣
14,163681364,Lisa Ann Daniel,• Chambers Heights,28w,If you all have so much time and energy into making our neighborhoods / city safer & cleaner spend some time volunteering and less time spreading angst on social media(edited)
15,163681364,Jancy S.,• Copper Flats,7 Oct,"Since you and Roberto said the exact same sentence, I will too.  If you have so much time to be telling other people what to do maybe you should be out volunteering yourself. Free country, voicing opinions on a public neighborhood site is ok."
16,163681364,Michelle Schreiber,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,8 Oct,Did you stop to think maybe that already do volunteer to the community and what's wrong with someone just lookin out for their own and other neighbors. Always someone wanting to attack
17,163681364,Kristabell Johnson,• Sable Altura Chambers,7 Oct,"Yeah, if you do not have a video or proof of him actually peeing I would leave it alone. If his back is to you how do you know it went onto the fence or in the yard. I’m sorry but this post could also be construed as being racist and at this time I would not post something like this. It’s not worth it. It is your word against his. It is pee. If women could stand and pee easily we wouldn’t have to almost pee ourselves trying to find a toilet and Covid-19 makes it hard to find public restrooms."
18,163681364,Vanita Hall Rawlins,• Sable Altura Chambers,7 Oct,where is proof
19,163681364,Pete Jend,• Apache Mesa,7 Oct,NO It is not ok.  I and my employees have to wash down areas and shovel up people excrement.  This is also across an alley from a K-8 school.  Is it ok for young children to see this or come across people droppings?  Even ancient civilizations and people living far from cities know human waste is dangerous.
20,163681364,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,7 Oct,"The guy peed on the fence that's it no excrement, no nothing else he just took a pee. I recently noticed a guy take a pee across the street and a neighbor's house in the yard when he was doing construction for them.  They were taking down a tree. He peed on the side of their garage. It happens all the time. Men pee everywhere it seems."
21,163681364,Michelle Schreiber,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,8 Oct,Good for you! I agree and can you believe they're actually making an arguement about a woman not wanting some random person urinating on their fence. WTH is wrong with these people??
22,163681364,Pete Jend,• Apache Mesa,7 Oct,"DS, Thanks.  You brought up a very big problem that is unknown to many.  And it's been getting worse over the years."
23,163681364,Chuck H L.,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,28w,So sad. Maybe hes got one kidney or could not wait. At least him a chance and he has a mask good thing. I guess women can't squat down either as they do it all the time in public.  But I dont see a penis or a stream of urine. So where is the proof?(edited)
24,163681364,roger womack,• Highline Villages,7 Oct,Well he is turned away from cameras so maybe the home owners ot a dose of indecent exposure ! Kids maybe ! Surprised by all the very liberal comments here . This must be how SanFrancisco headed down the gutter !
25,163681364,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,8 Oct,roger womack I didn't see anybody shouting their political leanings I just see people saying and take it easy. I don't think the pee is political.
26,163681364,Vanita Hall Rawlins,• Sable Altura Chambers,7 Oct,yes
27,163681364,Michelle Schreiber,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,8 Oct,Let him knock on your door and let him use your bathroom. Would you let him use it? No you wouldn't and don't say you would
28,163681364,Nancy Brigham,• Chambers Heights,8 Oct,Before the Pandemic some stores would not let customers use their bathrooms due to people using drugs. The bus station in downtown Denver lowered the height of the doors due to this issue.
29,163681364,Sara Loveless,• Lyn Knoll,7 Oct,"Bro, that's nasty as hell.  But chances are he was probably messed up and had to do his business no matter who was around.  Just wash it off and move on with your day, there's literally nothing you can do about it."
30,163681364,Brenda Cisse,• Highland Park East,7 Oct,This is cruel!!! You don’t know what condition that man is in!!! He may have lost his job and all he had!!! We are in a pandemic!!! He could be homeless with diabetes...
31,163681364,Pete Jend,• Apache Mesa,7 Oct,"So for all that believe public human waste is ok,  please volunteer to help me clean up.  I'll provide shovel, gloves, and bleach.  In my particular case,  it is people driving around drinking too much beer.  For the ""dumpers"", probably  living outside,  there are alternatives.   So far, the only thing that helped was posting signs saying "" no public urination...""  but in another language-not English."
32,163681364,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,7 Oct,Okay so pee is not the same as pooping on the street. What do you do when your dog pees on the street? Do you carry your bleach around?
33,163681364,Daniel J.,• Lyn Knoll,7 Oct,Haha funny how he's being defended
34,163681364,Chuck H L.,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,7 Oct,He is a human. Dont judge he could have medical problems that are not visible to the naked eye. Think about it. Im sure you've pulled your pecker somewhere someplace when drinking or just needed to take a pis. SMH unless you have sit like women? Never know. Right?
35,163681364,roger womack,• Highline Villages,7 Oct,What does are freaking city council say about this ?
36,163681364,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,28w,I hope they  put out more public toilets.(edited)
37,163681364,chad henry,• Highland Park East,7 Oct,About 3 billion humans have one of those ^*^s and we’ve all had to go so bad we couldn’t hold it another second. Think back to when dad wouldn’t stop the car no matter how you begged. POTUS wants to trash Obamacare and we’re worried about this???
38,163681364,Chuck H L.,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,7 Oct,EXACTLY. PEOPLE HAVE SO MUCH TIME TO JUST POINT FINGERS. MAYBE HE ACTUALLY CLEANED THE STREET.
39,163681364,Chuck H L.,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,28w,Can someone show me a video of how to clean up urine with a shovel? With the current HOT TEMPS THE URINE IS LONG GONE BY THE TIME YOU GRAB YOUR GLOVES BLEACH SHOVEL. HAHAHAAHA(edited)
40,163681364,Kathy Tiger,• Highland Park East,7 Oct,Clorox and water. Guess he was marking his territory. Lots of homeless moving this way. Soon you will see more than pee. Everyone needs to call the mayor’s office to ask what his plans are. We will end up like Denver.
0,163125855,J. D. M.,• Central Park,1 Oct,I really do prefer the homeless living in tents in the parks and along the trails as well!
1,163125855,Angel Acosta,• Montbello,1 Oct,This is the link provided: for details to the amendment:  https://www.denvergov.org/content/dam/denvergov/Portals/646/documents/Zoning/text_amendments/Group_Living/GroupLiving_Amendment7_PB_Draft.pdf
2,163125855,Yira Ordaz,• Green Valley Ranch,5 Oct,"While I get that homeless people need a safe to live and not just a tent near the interstate (etc), I don’t know how I feel about the 6 car thing... parking is already crazy as is."
3,163125855,Tiffany Gray,• Montbello,5 Oct,I don't have to address this issue without saying pray for our government. Congress is changing and we need to vote for John Hickenlooper in US office he is running. Homes for all is on the amendment.
0,171418468,Denise Kaza,• Locust St,20 Dec,I sent you a private message.

5,171418468,Danica Gonzales,• Vasquez Blvd,20 Dec,I have a two bedroom three windows I need linen and yes they do have blinds but I want curtains as well the windows let cool air in an there are 7 of us total in the house hold
6,171418468,Selena Tolar,• Locust St,21 Dec,"I have some sheets,hand towels, shower curtain. Pm me if you are interested"
7,171418468,Randall Montano,• Northeast Park Hill,25 Dec,"Have you ever heard of  contraception? I'm sure you get Plenty of our tax money for help with money, food,leap and housing you should be able to go to your local church for help with furniture! Please save all of your comments off how I'm being mean I don't like people who continue to have children when they can't even afford the first accident so save it for the  choir"
8,171418468,Bridget McCuiston,• Locust St,25 Dec,"Don't care if you don't want to hear contents of how mean you are. You truly are on of societies problems. Not everyone just has kids to collect government help. Not everyone situations are the same. I'm disabled yet still don't qualify for government assistance. I became disabled while working from a job that I truly enjoyed. So,  Get off your high horse because in reality, your no better than the rest of the human race."

10,171418468,Danica Gonzales,• Vasquez Blvd,25 Dec,First and for most god bless you im not a mean nor negative person I usually don't feed into negativity but the fact that you said you don't know why we continue to have kids if we cannot afford them shame on you you are no one to judge me you no nothing bout my life nor why the reason iam struggling so I'd appreciate it if you'd take your rude comments else where thank you and I will pray for you happy holidays have a blessed one

0,162299289,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,23 Sep,"The Denver Dumb Friends league has a program to have feral cats adopted. Usually by people who have land and barns, not as pets.  Call them and see if they have a solution on how to capture."
1,162299289,Davyd Smith,• Skyland,23 Sep,"We have quite a few rescuers in the NextDoor community.  Maybe we could organize something.  Although some community cats can be adopted, others cannot.  TNR is the single best solution.  I would be happy to participate in a neighborhood group that wanted to do something here, or help a group that is already doing somethin.  If you don't know what TNR is, here's a link.  https://www.alleycat.org/resources/how-to-implement-an-organizational-trap-neuter-return-program/"
2,162299289,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,23 Sep,The issue people don’t want cats around. The DFL will neuter and find them appropriate homes.
3,162299289,Linda Hendrick,• Historic Montclair,23 Sep,"All feral cats (with the exception of kittens) are too wild to be adopted, so I would definitely call Denver Dumb Friends League and see what they do with feral cats before you dump a bunch of them with DDFL. My guess: If they are older and totally feral, they will be euthanized. I'd personally prefer to see TNR steps taken."
4,162299289,Tammy Ringel,• Clayton,23 Sep,"TNR is tihe most humane option.  For a little education, cats are territorial and if you remove the cats that are around new ones will just show up and take over that territory.  If you can get them all fixed eventually the populations will decline.  It is truly the only way to solve the problem.  Ive seen this happen at my house - I removed a feral (she was adopted) and other cats showed up! I have gotten them all fixed and now I just have the few I take care of."
5,162299289,Jammie Massey,• North Park Hill,23 Sep,"Hmm I certainly have to educate myself. I'm trying to utilize natural deterrents like vinegar, coffee grounds, essential oils but some of these also deter the bees which I want, so... I have some reading to do. Thanks for the information. I have some hard work deadlines this week but next I come up for air and will post again or can DM a few of you if I have your permission because I do believe it has become a bit of a burden. As a farm girl we had feral cats for mice control but in the city it's a bit gross to have them everywhere and if I wanted a cat as a pet, I would have a cat. Feral cats aren't pets, but I also believe in humane treatment of all animals as well no matter what is happening in my garden or on my property."
6,162299289,Davyd Smith,• Skyland,23 Sep,Happy to participate. I hope everyone who mentioned TNR here joins to talk about it.
7,162299289,John Morse,• North Park Hill,23 Sep,Leave the cat alone there are too many on the streets and they cannot really do anything
8,162299289,Maria Draco,• Northeast Park Hill,23 Sep,"Feral cats exist because people have failed them... by dumping them outside intact, and letting intact cats roam. And once they become feral they cannot be adopted and only TNR is the humane thing to do.  If you see a community cat (not a pet) check for a tipped ear.  That means they have been fixed.  Let them be, it is not their fault they were left outside/abandoned/dumped.  If you see intact ferals visiting you... im sure one of us could help/assist you with getting them fixed so you don't see more cats."
9,162299289,Brandon Plath,• Central Park,23 Sep,"On the other side of the discussion, the coyotes are returning in numbers.  They thin the feral cat issue and have been trying to come back since 2013 flooding, green space fences, etc. They exist because humanity failed them!"
10,162299289,Amanda Payne,• Skyland,23 Sep,"I had a problem with cats using my gardens this summer and asked City Floral about it on Instagram. They told me to come in and ask staff about plants that deter cats. I never did, but I will probably look into for next summer."
11,162299289,Amanda Payne,• Skyland,23 Sep,"Also just want to say it isn’t just the feral cats. Any outdoor cat will be attracted to those spots once a cat has been using it. I hope you find something that works. I love cats, including ferals, but I get your frustration."
12,162299289,Susan Young,• South Park Hill,30w,"1-4 BILLION birds are killed annually in the US by cats. Cats are not a native species. Not a solution, sorry, just a comment.(edited)"
13,162299289,Davyd Smith,• Skyland,23 Sep,"That data has been shown to be quite false starting with the person that actually collected the data. Unfortunately, one rather large influential org used it and created a false narrative about that. Humans are the single greatest danger to every animal species."
14,162299289,Kari Rutter,• South Park Hill,23 Sep,Moth balls work well.  I put them in my planter boxes as the neighborhood cats seemed to think it was a fancy litter box.  It helped a LOT!
15,162299289,Mary Ellen Silcott,• North Park Hill,23 Sep,We tried mothballs.  Didn’t work at all. Smelled up the yard.
16,162299289,Lisa Kelley,• East Colfax,30w,"Using mothballs to repel pests in the garden presents a danger to children, pets and wildlife that visit your garden. Young children explore their surroundings by putting things in their mouth and animals might think they are food. Ingesting even a small amount of the toxic chemicals in mothballs can cause serious harm that requires immediate medical or veterinary attention. Mothballs in gardens also present a risk if you breathe the fumes or get the chemicals on your skin or in your eyes."
17,162299289,Carleigh Combs,• East Colfax,23 Sep,"Contact Denver Animal Shelter to see if they're still doing catch, fix,  and release. They need to be trapped so they can be spayed/neutered (and have their ear tagged) before being released where they were found or many times people will adopt them to be outdoor barn cats. "
18,162299289,Sherrie Kroemer,• East Colfax,23 Sep,It's inhuman to allow feral cats to run the neighborhood. It's also the pet cats that use gardens as toliets. How man
19,162299289,Maria Draco,• Northeast Park Hill,23 Sep,"So what are you suggesting?  Also, read the last line in the post."
20,162299289,Sherrie Kroemer,• East Colfax,23 Sep,How many dead cats were seen this week?

They hate all of those smells. There’s also spray you cAn buy, but the other stuff is probably already in your pantry."
24,162299289,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,24 Sep,I’ve used the spray when cats were coming into my yard even when my 2 big cat-hating dogs were out there chasing them over the fence or into the trees. I was afraid someone would get hurt and/or the cat(s) get killed. The spray is expensive - $20 for a small bottle but it worked and I haven’t had cats back in the yard for quite a while - knock on wood
25,162299289,Mary Ellen Silcott,• North Park Hill,24 Sep,"Yes, cat poop in inappropriate places is a pain. But so is that of squirrels, dogs, raccoons.  You should see the bird poop on my fence.  I can deal with it."
26,162299289,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,24 Sep,Cat poop can carry serious diseases and it’s hidden in the dirt so you don’t know it’s there until you might encounter it while gardening.
27,162299289,Liz Whit,• East Colfax,24 Sep,"I currently am trying to find the person or persons who seem to have targeted my cat. I'm pretty sure he has been poisoned, he is getting back on his feet after medication, and got out of the house this morning, only to come back sopping, n I do mean sopping wet. I am currently talking to higher ups to see what can be done once I find out what is really happening."

6,178102028,Michael Baca,• Central Park,24 Feb,There is no way this will happen.  The one on Colorado blvd is too close.  A Natural Grocers is more likely and much more needed for people with chronic health conditions.

I was told by a realtor that the city council shot down both Costco and Whole Foods. Costco is currently raising their pay to $16 an hour and has great working conditions. What’s the problem with good responsible companies.. oh i forgot... crappy city council reps.

2,162687417,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,29w,"Yes but there's nothing that we can do because being homeless is not illegal and peeing in the alley is a ticket, if they are caught in the act. If you can get a cop to see them do actually peeing, then they can do something about it, but they won't take it on hearsay. Perhaps we should have more porta potties put in our parks. That's one solution(edited)"
3,162687417,Calvin Webster,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,27 Sep,Let me repeat...four wheelers are not welcome on Alton nor any street. They are not allowed on city streets and I’m tired of being worried about the small children on the back & figuring out how to stop them.

I saw cars stopping there and give food and cleaning supplies to them so I think it will be nice to donate to those In need!! Also you might try Denver Rescue Mission !!! There is one location on Smith Road just a few blocks off Monaco at that location they have families living there so you know that your clothes will be a huge help !!! I hope my comment or suggestion won’t make someone mad and make a rude comment back to me !!!

8,163763417,Peter Higgins,• East Colfax,8 Oct,"In all seriousness, I get sad every time I drive by there. The Christmas tree lot that used that corner was the lot my family went to growing up and the lot I took my family to. Lots of great memories there. Then they fill it with a 7-11, which isn't even open for year before closing down. (Who would have thought that three 7-11's in a half-mile radius wouldn't work?)"

11,163763417,Amy Kuo,• South Park Hill,8 Oct,"Dunkin doughnuts...I think to be honest it would have to be a chain, something with financial backing because thats not an easy intersection.  A patio sounds nice in theory but Colfax brings some riff raff."
12,163763417,Kate Swan,• South Park Hill,28w,"I’d love a good breakfast and lunch spot, or a place with dinner takeout service. My understanding is that the land is restricted and cannot be used as a liquor store.(edited)"
13,163763417,Samantha Menard,• Historic Montclair,28w,"It is not restricted. The 7-11 tried to have a liquor license and the neighborhood said no...they ended up retracting the application for the license just before the hearing to decide if they should have one or not.

17,163763417,Patrick Payne,• East Colfax,8 Oct,Just about anything that goes there will fail due to lack of easy access.
18,163763417,Samantha Menard,• Historic Montclair,9 Oct,"This is a huge reason why the 7-11 closed down. Because you can’t drive in on Colfax or Monaco the only way in is Magnolia. Plenty of people see the place, but it was too much of a pain to get to in your car."

11,168066721,Aaron Smith,• Del Mar Parkway,16 Nov,"Sounds suspicious as hell to me. That they pulled over right next to you could have been coincidence. But to then speed up into the complex you just walked into? If they were just lost they wouldve been driving slowly the whole time, or when they realized where to go, would've driven normally to get there. Good on you keeping your situational awareness. Sucks that women have to put up with so much shit just living their life. The stories my sister's tell me are pretty infuriating."
12,168066721,Sharon C.,• Aurora Hills,16 Nov,When I walk my little dog I have the leash in one hand and the pepper spray in the other hand.  Don't leave home without it!
13,168066721,Katie R.,• Glendale,16 Nov,I have experienced multiple encounters like this late at night when taking my dog out. It’s creepy! And I end up fleeing into my complex due to the car following or pulling up on the curb. Not to be ignored as a woman was taken against her will into a car about a month ago.
14,168066721,Helo Wonderful,• East Colfax,17 Nov,Katie R. Really? Where did that happen?
15,168066721,Kristin Callahan,• Mayfair,16 Nov,Sorry to hear this Alyssa! Scary. Glad you are aware.
16,168066721,Teresa Z.,• Expo Park,16 Nov,I would strongly recommend reporting this to the police. You never know if it may help in a current or future case. 
17,168066721,Alyssa Chavarry,• Lowry,17 Nov,Of course! It was more suspicious behavior than anything and my first instinct was to distance myself from the vehicle. Didn’t get plates. It’s a lot harder in the moment I suppose
18,168066721,Sherry Johnson,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,3 Dec,Alyssa Chavarry I think you did exactly the right thing by making it to a safe spot. Taking the time to get that plate number could have cost you everything. I’m very happy I’m not learning your name today because you are missing!
19,168066721,Kammy Alford,• City Park West,16 Nov,I don't think you are overreacting at all!  Read the story on this site about the great dane that was probably stolen and found!  There was another story recently about a lost dog found in a homeless camp.  Please keep your pets and children under close supervision during these difficult times.  PLEASE!!!  It will save you much heartache!!!

21,168066721,Claudia Zwick,• Mayfair,16 Nov,"Alyssa, definitely trust your gut! There’s a reason that you got a bad feeling. Please report this to the police. Who knows? They could be looking for this vehicle."
22,168066721,Alyssa Chavarry,• Lowry,17 Nov,"I would’ve reported it if the individual has lowered their window to directly entice me or some other clear behavior of malice, but this was more of a suspicion and I believe the police can’t do anything with the incredibly vague information I have. I appreciate your concern though, and certainly will stay vigilant!"
23,168066721,Deb M.,• Valentia Court,17 Nov,Glad you shared! Not a bad idea to walk a different direction at a different time if your feeling uneasy. Thanks again for sharing!
24,168066721,Mary MacNaughton,• Highland Park East,17 Nov,Thank you for sharing we all need to watch out for each other especially women and  children.  A whistle would be great to have when you are walking alone. Be safe and stay smart at all times
25,168066721,Sherry Johnson,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,3 Dec,"Mary MacNaughton, the whistle is a great idea!"
26,168066721,Anne Eisen,• Windsor North,17 Nov,Thank you for sharing.  Maybe not related but I was turning east onto south Parker road at Florida around nine am on Monday and didn’t jump at the green arrow until my passages said it green go.  Just as he said that a similar looking car raced thru the red light.  Maybe the same 🚗 car
27,168066721,Vivian VanArsdale,• Del Mar Parkway,17 Nov,I believe that God gives us warnings when danger is upon us. I'm so glad that you are so astute and listened to your gut. There is a lot of wisdom in the comments above. calling the police is probably a good one they may be looking for that car the pepper spray etc. this world seems to be going crazy you can't leave your pets out you can't let your children out you can't be a woman walking alone. I never was afraid because I would say look I'm 66 years old I'm overweight and unattractive but I'm finding that that doesn't even matter to knuckleheads. So young men have also been pulled in and molested so all I can say is to everyone please just keep your eyes open be very safe be very cautious and listen to your inner voice.
28,168066721,Anne Eisen,• Windsor North,17 Nov,"I totally agree. Years ago when I lived near the Botanic Gardens and was going for my Sunday visit, I felt the skin on the back my neck rise and looked up to see this man staring. I turned around to go back home. He started running, I never ran so fast. Thank God I lived in a locked building. Latter that day there was a warning on the news to call the police if he was spotted."

12,171397267,Amanda Biffle,• Central Park,22 Dec,No at this point they’ve only requested the items listed above. They don’t have additional space to store a ton of things so they update their needs list regularly.

0,170411277,Carrie Lambert,• Skyland,12 Dec,Could you use this dresser? It’s tall and narrow. I could have it in our alley in the morning for you to pick up. Let me know!
1,170411277,Marcia Kayhanfar,• Northeast Park Hill,13 Dec,Thanks Carrie but I can’t use that
2,170411277,Chad Baker,• Skyland,13 Dec,"I'll send you a PM, but I also have a few things."
3,170411277,Laura Avant,• Northeast Park Hill,14 Dec,"I thought I read that one of the kids you will be helping has an interest in art.  If so, I have a nice heavy watercolor pad to give."
4,170411277,Laura Avant,• Northeast Park Hill,17 Dec,"If you happen to have things that these refugees won't need, like used clothing, shoes, blankets, toiletries, etc. Resurrection Clothing would love to have them.  We take clothing and things to the homeless camps several times a week.  I live really close in Skyland.  I could arrange to pick up from you Thursday or Friday because of a double quarantine before Tuesday's surgery or you could drop off at my house anytime except Tuesday.  My phone is 303-316-6748.  No cell phone right now."
5,170411277,Laura Avant,• Northeast Park Hill,17 Dec,Check out the free stuff.  There is a lot of furniture listed here.
0,170965696,Cristin Jolee,• Globeville,16 Dec,"Hi Danica, congratulations on the new home! Call Mile High United Way ASAP, there are a lot of organizations that are providing wonderful gifts for children. I have gotten some help as well. However, do it quickly because most have already distributed toys 🤗"
1,170965696,Danica Gonzales,• Vasquez Blvd,17 Dec,Okay cool thank you so much
0,160690732,Aldo Covarrubias,• Clayton,8 Sep,that is very human of you. hope that his person is ok
1,160690732,Sam Gilmore,• North Park Hill,8 Sep,I do too I felt so bad
2,160690732,Stevan Hidalgo,• East Colfax,8 Sep,"I've had a similar experience. A man was yelling 'call 911.' I called 911, gave my location, told 911 operator I didn't know where the man was. They sent police within about 10 minutes."
3,160690732,Sam Gilmore,• North Park Hill,8 Sep,I will try that next time I just hesitate to call police when it doesn't seem like a violent thing but then again it's like who else do you call?
4,160690732,Liz LaRue,• Northeast Park Hill,8 Sep,The hotel at 3737 N. Quebec St has been converted into homeless housing and since then the incidents like those you experienced have increased tremendously. You're not too far away from it so it could be from the people coming and going there. Someone OD'd in the alleyway around 33rd(ish) and Poplar on Saturday and in the park at 30th and MLK on Sunday night.
5,160690732,Sam Gilmore,• North Park Hill,8 Sep,"Damn that really sucks, not the homeless housing part but the OD's :("
6,160690732,LInda Poletti,• South Park Hill,8 Sep,You are a kind person Sam.  Thanks for trying to help another person.
7,160690732,dolly kramer moore,• Northeast Park Hill,8 Sep,My husband told me that a neighbor of ours said that they heard a similar thing near us two nights ago ish. We’re near 36th and magnolia.  I vote for calling the police and reporting the general area and the situation.
8,160690732,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,10 Sep,True. If the police come out and it’s someone who is messed up on something they generally call for an ambulance to take the person to Denver General for mental health issues
9,160690732,Judy Hill,• South Park Hill,8 Sep,"Sam, thanks for taking time and for your concern.Denver Post had an article yesterday (maybe Saturday) about the Mental Health Unit on call in the city.  They have a van and can respond to these types of calls.  The program has been around since 2016, but it seems people aren’t very aware of it so it is really underutilized. Check out the article, or info is probably on line or at 311.  Thanks again for your kindness."
10,160690732,Brad Burdick,• North Park Hill,8 Sep,This the article? ...https://www.denverpost.com/2020/09/06/denver-star-program-mental-health-police/?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_content=fb-denverpost&utm_medium=social&fbclid=IwAR1qo87fBtKrlRxU9e-lvGHPRr8w4qOrXTwiLqcDFKzhOWaCecOxQgBsoMM
11,160690732,John Sattler,• Clayton,8 Sep,Brad Burdick great article!  Thanks for sharing that info.  That’s a great program for so many reasons.
12,160690732,Monica Bryant-Taylor,• North Park Hill,9 Sep,"Be extremely careful!  I've read that sometimes these cries for help are intended to lure someone into danger.  So, I always call the police or investigate with another person."
13,160690732,Sam Gilmore,• North Park Hill,10 Sep,I guess I'm just like why would someone do that but that's true forsure
14,160690732,Monica Bryant-Taylor,• North Park Hill,9 Sep,The tricks that people are playing these days are mindblowing and beyond your wildest imagination!
15,160690732,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,9 Sep,"Personally if I heard someone yelling for help, I'd call 9-1-1 and let them deal with it. I'm not a first responder and wouldn't be able to do anything besides call 9-1-1 to assist the person anyway. Time saved not trying to find the person before just calling 9-1-1 anyway"
16,160690732,Megan Landry,• North Park Hill,9 Sep,"I direct messaged Sam and also took my post down. If you live in the area on our particular street, you are probably aware of who this individual is. He was not in danger nor is he a threat. I also did not find it appropriate to put his behavior on blast on this site, he has privacy rights. Again he was not in danger and poses no threat. I privately messaged Sam so all is good for who ever was concerned!"
17,160690732,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,10 Sep,"Megan, I don't think anybody KNEW this guy was some kind of special case whose yelling didn't need to be responded to. Nobody except you, apparently, knew he was not in danger or a threat. Nobody identified him to ""put his behavior on blast on this site"" because if it HAD been someone in distress, we use this site to keep our neighbors informed. Thanks to YOUR post, we now know if this specific individual yells for help, anyone who heard him the first time and can identify the same voice, will know it's nothing to worry about. For anyone else, we'd have no way of knowing because if we hadn't heard his voice before to know who it was, someone yelling for help is, to us ""uninformed"" people, someone yelling for help. It wasn't intended to offend or ""put his behavior on blast"" but when there is outrageous and/or unexpected behavior going on, people in this neighborhood (not famous for being one of the safest, mind you and we've had several people shot around here recently so a call for help just MIGHT be legitimate) people post here to keep the neighbors aware and informed."
18,160690732,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,9 Sep,"Good grief. I realize someone has ""freedom of speech"" but yelling for help when no help is needed is stretching the limits a bit. So now that throws another consideration into the mix. If someone is yelling for help, is it for real? Is it to lure someone to danger? Is it just someone who yells for help for no reason? "
19,160690732,Sam Gilmore,• North Park Hill,10 Sep,That's the dilemma I had too I wasn't sure if it was real or not but it's not really in my nature to look the other way. Should've just called but I dont also want to put someone in a more dangerous situation if it's not that serious. Idk it's just such a weird thing nowadays.
20,160690732,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,10 Sep,"Sam Gilmore the whole world is insane any more. It’s all too much to know what to do about anything any more. I guess whoever yells for help whether they actually need help or not is taking their chances, too. And we are unwitting players in their game"
21,160690732,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,10 Sep,"Sometimes with how f-omg crazy things are these days, maybe yelling for help is the only thing you can do. All the while knowing that no help is going to be provided because nobody can figure out what to do or whose responsibility it is to do anything at all"
22,160690732,Monica Bryant-Taylor,• North Park Hill,32w,"I'm just saying be careful whatever decision you make, myself included.  I'm not one to look the other way either.  I'll be the first to make some phone calls to figure out what to do.  I wish it was within my power to do something about the things I see going on around me, in/out of my neighborhood.  Talk about being a long time resident I went to Kindergarten at the former Philips Elementary at the corner of Montview and Monaco now Odyssey Charter so, I've seen and experienced all of the heartbreaking changes and challenges in this neighborhood.  I realize all of these issues are and will always be bigger than me.  I often feel like sharing my opinion but, it falls on deaf ears. It baffles me how many other states are successfully conquering these issues and others.  What makes Colorado any different or special?  Matter of fact, I live near 29th and Niagara St. as well and unfortunately I haven't heard it.  And, unfortunately why people do what they do is unimaginable and unexplainable but, they do.  Sometimes the answer is just as craaaazy as the action.  It's beyond me to figure it out.  I can't afford to waste my precious time and energy doing that.(edited)"
23,160690732,Sam Gilmore,• North Park Hill,11 Sep,I definitely understand where you are coming from. Its unfortunate that these things happen at all
24,160690732,Monica Bryant-Taylor,• North Park Hill,12 Sep,"Sam Gilmore, right!"
0,160201427,Susan Cardasis,• East Colfax,3 Sep,"I don't know if I have any quilts but I may have some blankets.  Are you only interested in quilts?  Also, what kind of shelters?"
1,160201427,Charles Mercado,• East Colfax,3 Sep,"Blankets can help, thank you. I'll PM ."
2,160201427,Jan H.,• Lowry,3 Sep,Gosh I thought these were going to homeless people
3,160201427,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,4 Sep,I would think blankets would work just as well and be a lot easier to wash and maintain than quilts
4,160201427,Charles Mercado,• East Colfax,5 Sep,Sure... blankets are great too!  Trying to insulate outside and inside of shelters.   Will appreciate any and all donations for the animals!
5,160201427,Emily Jane,• North Park Hill,21 Sep,Hi Charles! Are you still in need of blankets/quilts? I have some for you
0,164240464,Christine Rossi,• South Park Hill,12 Oct,"I learned through my church (St Ignatius Loyola) of a woman in Park Hill who is collecting donations for homeless women. Call Sally at 303-523-7601. Depending on the items you’re donating, another option may be Clinica Tepeyac in northwest Denver. Their number is 303-458-5302. Your generosity will undoubtedly be warmly welcomed!"
1,164240464,Joy Henika,• Central Park,12 Oct,Here is another great option. I am happy to pick up the items and take them for you if you would like. https://cwee.org/
2,164240464,Sherry Stevenson,• Central Park,12 Oct,I will send you a PM later today to pick up this week. Thank you
3,164240464,Chuck H L.,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,12 Oct,There is a church on 14 and Joilet they take donations and they could use them thank you
4,164240464,Amy Spears,• Central Park,12 Oct,Do any of these places take fabric masks?
5,164240464,John Larkin,• Hoffman Heights,14 Oct,Comitis would be a good place they are right beside the district 2 police station at 20th and wheeling.
0,160715261,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,8 Sep,I’m so sorry!  How freighting!  Usually most mentally ill people are off their meds and not violent.  What are your cross streets.
1,160715261,Brett Matens,• South Park Hill,10 Sep,23/Cherry
2,160715261,Belinda Walker,• North Park Hill,9 Sep,The homeless have invaded Park Hill. They opened up a shelter in our community. Just stay vigilant and alert because they roam around. Stay safe!
3,160715261,Michael Heringslack,• South Park Hill,9 Sep,Your empathy is overwhelming.
4,160715261,Elisabeth Brinson,• North Park Hill,9 Sep,"We had someone ring our doorbell at 11pm two days ago (we didn’t answer, he appeared to be drunk), doesn’t look like the same person - but it does seem like there are a few people around the area doing this at the moment."
5,160715261,Keith McDermott,• South Park Hill,32w,"Hey. I need to apologize, this guy rang my doorbell a bunch and was yelling on my front porch a while before yours. When he wouldn't leave I went to my front door and handled it but should have called the police. I was tired and annoyed that he woke my kids up but should have called for help. Lesson learned and again sorry(edited)"
6,160715261,Desiree Pickford,• Northeast Park Hill,10 Sep,"I really feel as a community we need to complain to  District representative, for the simple fact that our neighborhoods is being trashed, houses are being broken into and anything in our yards is a invite to these homeless  people around here. And when the neighborhood becomes less appealing  our value of our home will be less than we paid for them. But our  Property taxes seem to keep rising.We pay taxes on these local parks and cannot enjoyed them any longer due to the homeless  invasions.  It wouldn't  be bad if the would be pressed to keep it clean. Have you driven on the other side of Smith road and seen how it looks? It's like a dump"
7,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,10 Sep,"When the homeless community got kicked out of the Capitol building area earlier this year around there was an influx of people living in tents in a park on East Colfax. I forget the name of the park but it is on the way to a friend's house - the park went from having children and families in it to being full of tents and trash, full of people visibly not sober. Its a sad situation all around"
8,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,32w,"No i get it, its sad for everyone. The thing with the shelters is that to sleep there you have to be sober and a lot of homeless have addiction problems."
9,160715261,Amy Heil,• East Colfax,10 Sep,🤦🏼‍♀️
10,160715261,Katy Allen,• North Park Hill,10 Sep,I would prefer we quit saying “the homeless”. It’s kinda dehumanizing. Also we don’t know all this crime is from “the homeless”. I have been following crime for about ten Years in park hill and this isn’t new. It is sad that a lot of safe havens and shelters have closed during COVID too so people are just trying to survive. No I do not approve of crime but I really think there are systemic problems contributing to this.
11,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,10 Sep,"Not trying to start an argument, genuinely asking, what phrase would be preferable?"
12,160715261,Katy Allen,• North Park Hill,10 Sep,Thanks for your wonderful conversation....not being sarcastic at all. I enjoy this respectful conversation. As neighbors we don’t have to agree but I enjoy learning from each other. Here is an article I http://humilityofmaryshelter.com/shelter-uses-person-first-language/
13,160715261,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,32w,Wonderful article!  You have taught me so much!  Thank you!  I believe words are important.  Great question.(edited)
14,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,12 Sep,"I'll agree to disagree here. It makes no sense to me, both phrases mean the same thing.  For example, calling me a Mexican person is exactly the same as calling me a person of Mexican heritage."
15,160715261,Katy Allen,• North Park Hill,12 Sep,I think it is important to ask people what phrasing feels right to them so makes sense to me! Most of the literature shows that there is less discrimination that occurs when people use person first language but you always get to identify the way it feel right to you.
16,160715261,Katy Allen,• North Park Hill,32w,Also if you read about mental health there is a strong push not to call people a schizophrenic or bipolar. It is better to say a person with schizophrenia so the persons mental health isn’t the focus but the focus is they as people.(edited)
17,160715261,Katy Allen,• North Park Hill,32w,Also homelessness and mental health are not the same concepts as race/ethnicity but I think it’s important to refer to people the way they want to be referred to so glad you said that. Some people would say race and ethnicity are core aspects of identity where having a home and/or mental illness are not(edited)
18,160715261,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,12 Sep,"Also let me just add , I love that this thread is continually a civil sharing of insights and opinions. Too often on Next Door have threads like these completely imploded, with people stooping to insults and name calling. A refreshing change of pace!"
19,160715261,Elisa Reid,• Mayfair,14 Sep,Looks homeless ????
20,160715261,Anne Culver,• Historic Montclair,14 Sep,How grim.
21,160715261,Arlene Hetherington,• Central Park,15 Sep,"I've noticed a street full of dilapidated campers and some tents north of Smith road, with lots of garbage accumulated in the area.  It looks like these people are trying to bag up some of the garbage but of course there is no waste disposal pickup so the piles of trash keep growing."
22,160715261,Nicole H.L.,• Historic Montclair,16 Sep,We should keep in mind that police are often not the best people to bring into these situations.  Asking for a social worker or emts only would be a way to proceed in the future.
23,160715261,Liz LaRue,• Northeast Park Hill,16 Sep,"Unfortunately the homeless outreach officers were unable to respond for an estimate of 2 months when we contacted them for an encampment that settled behind our home, across our alley."
24,160715261,Dan Davidson,• South Park Hill,16 Sep,That’s on my block I must slept through it😝
25,160715261,Brett Matens,• South Park Hill,16 Sep,"All: I apologize if I used any inappropriate terminology in my post. I’m just reading through all of the interaction. Experiencing homelessness is not a defining characteristic of others nor is it appropriate to  define mental health without the right terminology or without a professional opinion.   My post was merely an FYI to neighbors and those were my original thoughts of how to describe the situation (his actions, sleeping bag, etc).  I see this as a forum to keep each other educated and informed."
26,160715261,Ana Gonzo,• Northeast Park Hill,16 Sep,You don’t have anything to apologize for.

2,169622087,Astrid DeVos,• Central Park,4 Dec,"Question, the toys or the household items are the highest priority?"
3,169622087,Marcia Kayhanfar,• Northeast Park Hill,20w,It depends who you’re looking to buy for :) room decorations are for the preteens and toys are for the little ones. I think the top priority is the basketball and batteries(edited)
4,169622087,Lizzy Mag,• South Park Hill,4 Dec,"Sent some craft and toys, my mother in law is sending clothes and curtains! Thanks to everyone else who is donating <3"
5,169622087,Marcia Kayhanfar,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Dec,great! they will be thrilled! The girls wanted cool bedrooms so badly
6,169622087,Nicole Wieder,• South Park Hill,4 Dec,"Hi there! So, I just placed an order through your Amazon list. A couple of things to note. The crocs you had listed are backordered, but I found and ordered you two pairs that are both blue and in stock, so you might want to delete that item from your list. Also, I ordered AA batteries, but not from your list because those are out of stock. And I got an even bigger pack than the one you asked for. Everything else I sent came directly from your list. Thank you so much for organizing this."
7,169622087,Nicole Wieder,• South Park Hill,4 Dec,"Oh, and it probably came through as being ordered by Tim C. That's my husband."
8,169622087,Marcia Kayhanfar,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Dec,That’s great thank you for the update! A lot of stuff is selling out. I just took the crocs and batteries off. Thank you
9,169622087,Holland Darcy,• South Park Hill,4 Dec,"I’ll have a look at the wishlists tonight as well and send some things! Thank you to our neighborhood for our collective kindness! And thank you, Marcia, for helping these families!"
10,169622087,Laura Avant,• Northeast Park Hill,5 Dec,"If you end up with extra of anything, my colleague and I at Resurrection Clothing are gathering toys for kids and ""things"" for teens.  She also goes to the homeless encampments several evenings and hands out food and clothing.  She just gave away $400 worth of clothes I bought at the ARC (with vouchers from them).  This is only if you have more than you need; I don't want to detract in any way from the good you are doing."
11,169622087,Marcia Kayhanfar,• Northeast Park Hill,5 Dec,"Is Resurrection Clothing a nonprofit? If so, my work can contribute funds in the new year. We need a couple new causes. They couldn’t help me because it’s just a personal mission"
12,169622087,Laura Avant,• Northeast Park Hill,5 Dec,"Marcia Kayhanfar RC is a non profit with an EIN number but not a 503c 3 or 4 because I don't know how to do the paperwork for this.  Donations are not tax deductible until someone can help me do the paperwork.  I have applied for a grant through my insurance company so I can afford a storage unit and some cash for laundry expense, but they lost the papers before the deadline.  I can reapply, but it is very small and won't cover transportation, logistics, or any but the smallest cash expenses.   Goodwill is all closed or I would ask them for a discount again.  So now I am dependent on vouchers from the ARC to buy clothes, etc. and Knitting for Peace for warm hats and scarves.  y manager and I are also trying to provide some toys for kids and    ""things"" for teens since so many are poor."

14,169622087,Marcia Kayhanfar,• Northeast Park Hill,5 Dec,thank you! :) The preteen girls are totally ecstatic about all these presents! They know the basics but not the details of everything. Like 'room decorations' they are going to love what they get

17,169622087,Bella Lo,• Clayton,22 Dec,Hey the PayPal timing has closed. I noticed you still have some things and I’d love to give some $$ to you to get the last minute things. Amazon is saying that a lot of the things aren’t going to get in before Christmas
18,169622087,Blake Lawler,• Elyria Swansea,17w,If anyone is still able to I'm trying to get stocking stuffers for my husband and daughter. Husband is 100% disabled combat vet and I am a full-time student.  He's getting depressed. Some kind people are bringing Christmas dinner and someone was able to help with 3 of the gifts on my daughter's list. Her birthday is right after. She is 14 gonna be 15. My student loan money for living expenses won't be here until the 15th of January. I made Thanksgiving dinner and handed it out and am constantly helping when we have extra of anything so a little help this year would be appreciated. 💞 we got help a few years ago from soldiers angels after my husband's heart surgery but I was 5 days too late this year.(edited)

22,172302989,Heather Doolittle,• Mayfair,1 Jan,"First off, congratulations on your apartment, and your new-ish dog. I’m glad to hear your pup is okay. That can’t be easy to transition from homelessness, and I’m sure most people are impressed by what you’re doing, not judgmental. The fact that you took in a homeless pet only a month after getting an apartment yourself shows you have a kind heart. I looked up your location and found you live with walking distance to Central Park Animal Hospital and Montclair Animal Clinic. I was thinking I could pre-pay for vet service to take the stress out of your next vet need. I’m guessing some other neighbors would like to contribute too. Both places are closed today, but it would probably be simple to set up if you’re interested. Thanks for taking in your dog, loving him, and reaching out to get him help."

This is Denver and Denver City Council once again abdicating their responsibilities for corrections and dumping it on the community to resolve.  Im not exactly sue why we even have a city council.  It has become as corrupt as Washington DC."
3,183754111,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,1w,This group has also lobbied heavily with fear instead of facts against the SOS operations equating them with unsanctioned encampments.

0,157614107,Alli Jackson,• Aurora Arts District,36w,"Thank you so much for such a thoughtful post. I am a social worker in the area and also born and raised in Aurora. Unfortunately this is a hurry up and wait type of situation. And since I am privileged to have a roof over my head I don’t have the answer. However, number one contributor to this is Gentrification. The entire Denver metro area bulldozed all the affordable housing for rich folk from out of state to pay for. Moving from San Francisco tech to downtown Denver seems like a steal because it is. And now officials look around perplexed at the amount of homeless folks. The one thing I know to be true is to have empathy, give with our expectations, and look into attending a city council meeting and speaking up to your representatives and even consider higher level platforms that give your voice a boost.(edited)"
1,157614107,Rachael Eye,• Del Mar Parkway,10 Aug,Locals have to go to City Hall and demand rent control. Expect to be committed to the cause for years.
2,157614107,Dani Goon,• Del Mar Parkway,11 Aug,"This! Rent control is absolutely necessary at this point. The growth is following suit with California, so they need to follow suit with policies as well. Renters have almost no rights here, that needs to change."
3,157614107,Christine Rippe,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,36w,"Sean, it's funny that you post this as my husband and I were just talking about many of the issues you raised here. As others have mentioned, becoming active within the community and policy- making process may help. I'm not a native, but have lived in the Denver metro area for almost 14 years. Definitely a lot of changes, many of which are very sad and disheartening. Thanks for your post.(edited)"
4,157614107,Randy Peal,• Del Mar Parkway,10 Aug,"As long as greed exists the housing boom will persist. During a pandemic with joblessness over 10% & still seeing an 8% increase over last year something is not right. Unless we have a complete housing crash the medium housing price will continue to be over $600,000. The answer I see to this issue is to move to a cheaper state, it will never change when big money is involved unless it’s forced by a crash."
5,157614107,TaRosa Jacobs,• Aurora Arts District,36w,Not everyone can afford to pick up and move and what happens when wages remain stagnant but the cost of living continues to rise no matter where you go? We can't address these issues by telling people to move. We need to address stagnant wages and a system that fails to protect the economically vulnerable.(edited)
6,157614107,Leslie Taylor,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,10 Aug,"Even though there's compassion and empathy for the homeless plight, the reality is you must need and ask for help if you truly want to make a difference. Many of those people enjoy what they what they do and how they live. When you try to give them better options, they fight against it because they don't like rules and regulations."
7,157614107,TaRosa Jacobs,• Aurora Arts District,10 Aug,"This is ignorant and insulting. The large number of individuals and families who are pushed into homelessness by gentrification intersecting with low wages aren't homeless in defiance of rules and regulations; they're homeless because too many in our society choose to see poverty as a personal, rather than societal, failure. Able-bodied individuals who are willing to work but lack adequate skills shouldn't live in abject poverty in spite of their desire to work hard and care for themselves and their loved ones and, in a society as wealthy as our own, mentally and physically disabled people and helpless children shouldn't be allowed to fall through the cracks simply because they can't fully provide for themselves. It's not that the homeless overwhelmingly disdain rules and regulations, it's that we continually craft and allow rules and regulations that show no regard for the poor, the struggling and the potentially homeless. That doesn't reflect poorly on the impoverished, it reflects poorly on those of us who would rather judge an impoverished person for slipping through the cracks than challenge a wealthy society that lets so many fall."
8,157614107,Dominique Suel,• Del Mar Parkway,10 Aug,Those people!!!😳😳that is so judgmental. I pray you never go through real hard times.
9,157614107,Leslie Taylor,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,10 Aug,"Not judgmental, only you are. It is true so many of them do not seek or want help? They're many agencies that are willing to help but no one can make them go or take advantage of the services offered."
10,157614107,TaRosa Jacobs,• Aurora Arts District,10 Aug,"Ok, so we're talking about people who want help. Now what? Do you have any ideas to contribute or would you rather just continue to judge people who are struggling and need resources? You say there are resources, so what are they? What recommendations do you have? If there's so much out there,  help us out and list them here."
11,157614107,"Yasmeen Nkrumah-Elie, PhD",• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,10 Aug,"Part of the challenge is that many people that end up in these situations do not know where to go for help. There is often a disconnect between the resources and the people that need them. They are not “those people,” they are our neighbors."
12,157614107,Nancy Brigham,• Chambers Heights,10 Aug,The Agencies need to go out and talk to the people with needs.  Though Sean is right that Denver is too expensive.  Aurora isn't far behind.

14,157614107,Judy Wilson,• Aurora,11 Aug,I believe north aurora is growing because the Colorado University and colleges/medical school and Children Hospital moved over to the Peoria and Colfax area. 
15,157614107,Nic Banes,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,14 Aug,"And now those high rise condos (or maybe apartments?) are finally being built on Colfax and Peoria. It’s been put off for about 5 years, but all of a sudden the construction is in progress again. I’m imagining the rent will be pretty insane as it’s essentially across the street from the hospital. Just an observation"
16,157614107,Aaron Rosenbluth,• Central Park,36w,Legal cannabis (marijuana is actually a term with racist roots—cannabis is the plant’s actual name) is not the cause of what you’re describing.

17,157614107,Zack Hagan,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,12 Aug,"I recently moved here from Brooklyn, NY (possibly the gentrification capital of the United States). I really like N Aurora because in many ways it mirrors the Brooklyn neighborhood I was gentrified out of.  So I know what it's like to be both the gentrifier and the gentrifee. It can be terrible to those who are pushed out but generally speaking the same people who are pushed out will move to other places dispacing even more unfortunate people. Instead of people getting bitter we all need to just try and make our little place better -even if we're displaced."
18,157614107,TaRosa Jacobs,• Aurora Arts District,12 Aug,"This response is well-intentioned but misguided and completely overlooks the realities of those dealing with abject poverty and/or displacement. You can't make anything better if you don't have food or a place to live. At some point, those of us who are not dealing with crushing social circumstances have to recognize that it falls to us to help do the work to stop allowing people who want to survive to simply fall through the cracks."

4,158601500,Darcy T.,• Alamo Placita,35w,Didn’t we as tax payers purchase this property back in 2016 for this very purpose??? I had exchanged several emails with Hancock’s office and this is the response from dept. of housing stability on behalf of Hancock’s office. This space has been accessible for 4 years to my knowledge. Why the delay?????🧐🧐🧐(edited)

6,158601500,Maureen M.,• Five Points North,24 Aug,Ami Webb that’s a different location where City did create a homeless shelter. Nearby but a different location.
7,158601500,Darcy T.,• Alamo Placita,19 Aug,Screen shot of source for the above post.
8,158601500,Peter M.,• Baker,19 Aug,"Good catch Darcy!  Perhaps the cost estimate of 19 mil isn't for a purchase then, but for a renovation, certainly a kitchen and dining area, showers, toilets and sinks, I'm guessing for men & women, possibly even a separate area for married persons; then again, will it be a group environment as with a camp, or individual rooms?  Then the food, the water, the toilet paper, etc., etc., etc..  "

11,158601500,Beth Ferrier,• Platt Park,19 Aug,It passed but nothing happening. He needs to work at a food bank like the one located at the Denver south hispanic community church open to anyone every Weds. fro 1-3.
12,158601500,Larry Koonce,• Holly Hills/Holly Ridge,19 Aug,"With all due respect, Hancock has never spent a moment in office, where he did something FOR the homeless! The policy out of Hancocks office only has a program to do TO the homeless."
13,158601500,KR C.,• Mar Lee,19 Aug,"Follow the money!  The facts Darcy T posted on the fact that the building hasn't been used since 2016 would make one wonder where the money is now and why the property hasn't been used?  But, is this the real answer or might there be other solutions?"
14,158601500,NH Anderson,• Golden Triangle,19 Aug,"I talked with District Rep. Hines. He remarked that each group is its own community, some with organized leadership, others with no rules. These are fellow human beings and despite all faults and bad choices, they need support. They don’t want support? Some do."
15,158601500,NH Anderson,• Golden Triangle,19 Aug,The government sanctioned camps need leadership and enforcement.
16,158601500,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,19 Aug,"There are two distinct classes of homeless. One is those homeless because of job loss, eviction and other hard-times that have befallen them. They would work if they could find jobs."

18,158601500,Florence Sebern,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,19 Aug,4330 E 48th Avenue - owned by the City and County of Denver
19,158601500,Florence Sebern,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,19 Aug,"The city is going to LEASE this property to a PRIVATE OPERATOR, who will make $19M over 10 years."
20,158601500,Jennifer J.,• University Park,19 Aug,Do you have an alternative solution?
21,158601500,Peter M.,• Baker,19 Aug,I wonder what oversight the city plans on having in place to know how the private contractor will be operating the facility in a couple of years.
22,158601500,J. Scott Farrow,• Beeler Park,20 Aug,"I think you read that wrong. The lease for the building will cost $19 million/year. (Warehouse space is very expensive in Denver these days, due to legalized marijuana.) There's no mention in the article of who will operate the shelter or how much that will cost. AFAIK, all existing shelters are operated by non-profits."

24,158601500,Florence Sebern,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,20 Aug,"The City owns the building. In fact, the purchase requisition stated ""Acquire space for use as an overflow shelter and general city storage."" "
25,158601500,Darcy T.,• Alamo Placita,20 Aug,My question exactly. We are being played like a fiddle with hanncock at the wheel.
26,158601500,Peter M.,• Baker,35w,"I bet that there has been a fear / concern that once the changes are made to the structure of the building, and the people are in, they'd have a permanent facility for homelessness on their hands, now we know at least as connected to a 10 year lease, and a catalyst for more; Denver, the magnet for the homeless and in need, they will all come for a visit, if you just plant the seed."
27,158601500,STEVE HARLEY,• Baker,35w,"please step back from the “scandal” for a second — Denver indeed owns 4330 E 48th Ave, but that’s not the facility mentioned in the too-short article Nextdoor chose to share with us; 4330 has been in operation for several years, currently by Denver Rescue Mission:"
28,158601500,Ami Webb,• New Green Valley Ranch,20 Aug,Exactly.
29,158601500,Peter M.,• Baker,20 Aug,"This is good clarifying information.  In our age of social media, distrust of just about everybody holding some position of authority, at least insofar as honesty and being up front about mistakes and future plans, the city's media department ought to have considered providing this information to the public, as a service of information, to them (us all).  The homeless dilemma and the accompanying crime city wide are not a small issues, they have been steadily growing for a very long time, and despite being voted down, the inaccurate news from C4 comes a week after our city counsel was reported to have wanted to nix the DPD and create a Peace Force.  These are constant seeds of discouragement that unsettle people who live all over the city."

0,158709256,Damien C.,• Whittier,20 Aug,Maybe a purchase by the city to help those who are homeless?
1,158709256,Darcy Strayer,• Congress Park,21 Aug,We all know most Denverites actually hate people who are homeless. There is no way that neighborhood would allow “those kinds of people” to be housed there even if we did somehow convince the city to purchase it.

Just seemed like a funny story,although he designed a lot of Denver’s buildings he was quite a character."

14,157646317,Rich M.,• Wellshire,10 Aug,Thanks for the heads up for those of us who use Washington Park frequently. I came back to my car last Wednesday to find a bright yellow envelope sticking out of my driver's door. I and dozens of others on Downing received our little notes from Officer Shook. Yes the sign is there and yes I will submit my payment forthe violation but shame on the city for not providing at least a heads up that what hadn't been enforced since covid began is now active again. Wash Park continues to be locked up so we cannot park within the park. We have to park blocks away the first Wednesday of the month.
15,157646317,Jim D.,• West Colfax,10 Aug,They emailed me. Three times. They give notice.
16,157646317,Nina B.,• Sloans/Highlands,10 Aug,It started last month and I saw notices as well as news coverage then.

25,157646317,Violeta Garcia,• Windsor East,11 Aug,When do streets that gave no signs get swept? Dayton between Alameda and the high line canal needs to be swept.
26,157646317,John Morris,• Mayfair,11 Aug,Street sweeping coincides with recycling on my block so the street sweepers go around the purple bins which they haven’t found a way to ticket yet.
27,157646317,Byeongsook S.,• West Colfax,11 Aug,Same for my side of the street on Osceola.  It coincides with waste/recycle pick up.  Can city departments coordinate their schedules so that the sweeping is more effective?
28,157646317,Phyllis K.,• Fort Logan,11 Aug,I have tried several times to sign up and get notices. It says I already have an account set up with them but I can’t remember the password I used. It say I need to reset my password but there is not function I can find that lets me do that.

0,157050220,Karen Schwieder,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,4 Aug,"Yes, call Access Aurora at 303-739-7000 and tell them to relay this homeless camp situation to ""Shelley McKittrick, Homelessness Program Director. Give Access Aurora all the location information you can. Shelley spoke at our NANO meeting March 12th and wants this information relayed to her; even people standing on the corner with a sign. She wants to provide these people with resources."
1,157050220,Susan Bennett,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,14 Aug,I emailed her and she is on leave deferring to Nancy Sheffield.
2,157050220,Leslie Taylor,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,4 Aug,Thank you all for your help and support. I have empathy for them but they
3,157050220,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,"But they do have a right to go in camp in the park unless the city can find them adequate sleeping quarters. That is what the higher court has decided. And by the way the homeless population is going to absolutely explode now that the moratorium that has been lifted on evictions, and unemployment is running out. It's not illegal to be homeless."
4,157050220,Josh Reid,• Sable Altura Chambers,4 Aug,I'd call the police to have them sweep like they did downtown
5,157050220,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,Then they can come right back. what they're doing downtown is moving people so they can clean and then the people are coming right back. You do realize that right?
6,157050220,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,16 Aug,"By the way all that did was move them from the parks into the neighboring streets so now they're all over Cap Hill, camping all over peoples neighborhood streets. it is safer for them to camp together but all you're doing is pushing them from one place to another. These people are human beings not rats to be exterminated."
7,157050220,Jenn Brewer,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,4 Aug,It’s amazing to me how police officers turn a blind eye to this. It bothers me bcuz we are paying out of our rears for rent or mortgages to live in Colorado but yet they won’t do anything about the homelessness. I do feel for them but when we pay taxes for these people to live in front of our homes. That’s Not fair at all.
8,157050220,Charlotte Naas,• Chambers Heights,5 Aug,"The police aren't turning a blind eye to this. I've called them, they've come and done a sweep in the back of where I live it is by The High Line canal and they move the camps that are over here, they don't turn a blind eye if they don't know where the people are, they can't do anything about them unless someone says something."
9,157050220,Brandon Wemyss,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,4 Aug,Its nice to have financial security in these unprecedented times. Not everyone has the time and luxury to worry so much about what the less fortunate are up to.
10,157050220,Jenn Brewer,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,4 Aug,I completely agree with you. I just feel like the people that are supposed to help the homeless and tax payers aren’t doing their job. I only blame the lack of resources to help these people out of the parks so we can have a sense of security or piece of mind. We don’t have to look out our front or backyards at camps.
11,157050220,Susan Bennett,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,4 Aug,"What floors me is that we don't have some kind of a safe to camp system that has toilets, showers, trash cans, basic medical attention, and just a place you can pitch your tent and not worry that it will be taken away before you get back from work or looking for work. We were homeless years ago and being able to have a safe designated campsite let us keep our jobs, the kids in school and finally get an apartment again. Housing size and prices here amaze me. I am sure a lot of the people in tents or wishing they at least had a tent would consider a 200 - 400 sq ft home with a door and bathroom that could be affordable on a minimum to median wage without having to file for welfare assistance as the lap of luxury, but last time I checked our codes were not allowing them. Hopefully the Access Aurora folks can get the resources to get folks safe soon."
12,157050220,Charlotte Naas,• Chambers Heights,5 Aug,They actually had started to set up something like that in the downtown area and then covid-19 hit and it changed everything
13,157050220,Linda Bailey,• Norfolk Glenn,5 Aug,Call police they have to move them
14,157050220,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,Actually they're not allowed to move them unless they need to clean. After it is cleaned they can come right back. It is not illegal to be homeless.
15,157050220,Dan Rockne,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,"Good luck I’ve been complaining to the Mayor, CW Murillo and using access aurora for over a month about Spencer Garrett park and they don’t do a damn thing. They don’t even respond to your email, and access aurora marks any homeless complaint as “completed” the next day"
16,157050220,Lisa Mumpton,• Morris Heights,5 Aug,"They do attempt to make contacts and offer services, but they may not contact you again.  But the homeless population are very mistrustful of non profit and governments, They also know that a lot of what they offer will never be enough to get them completely off the streets.  And after a month or two some of them are so affected by the adverse conditions of this lifestyle that they aren't always thinking clearly and making the best choices.  I know that it is extremely frustrating.  If they leave and leave items  Aurora Parks will remove items and discard them.  Some of the encampments are being asked to move at least away form populated areas and public areas as things are opening back up now.  There was a statewide ask not to completely displace the encampments during the COVId crisis as many of these people literally had no place else to go.  I supervise a public building that was closed until recently and we actually had to move people out of the way to get in the front door.  We even had to remove items form the park to stop people from going on our roof at night.  Frustrating, unsanitary, unhealthy and heartbreaking all  at the same time."
17,157050220,Charras Scott,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Aug,"I use us all can help them   I would hate to call the cops or any other system to move them but I get it, it gets out of hand but it not going to make a difference moving they just gonna move to a new area til someone else complain on the so it’s really not helping nothing but moving in circles."
18,157050220,Resham Ahmed,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,I observed the same it’s uncomfortable and it’s right next to the Police station I remember a crime committed in New York inna park attached to police station in their backyard it’s sad there many wasted buildings in Denver where they can house these people but the city should be the one to make that decision not police !
19,157050220,Resham Ahmed,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,Yes I agree Charras Scott it makes everyone uncomfortable but the situation needs to be rectify for safety unfortunately this shelter is located next cops ???
20,157050220,Lorilee Chavez,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,My problem is in the morning they walk around naked and my daughter will need to walk through this park to go to practice
21,157050220,David Navarro,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Aug,I'd call the police on that one!
22,157050220,Sarah Diem,• Hoffman Heights,5 Aug,Thats indecent exposure and a crime unrelated to homelessness. I would definitely report whoever is doing this
23,157050220,Garred McMillen,• Aurora,5 Aug,"Don't call it's pointless. There's an Aurora app you can download. It specifically has a homeless outreach section on it. It creates a ticket in their official city system and forces them to drive it to completion. When you call they can just blow you off, or transfer you endlessly."

25,157050220,Dan Rockne,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,12 Aug,This ap is worthless when you use it they move your complaint to “completed” the next day
26,157050220,Leslie Taylor,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,Thanks to all. I will start with the social Agencies first before contacting the Police because I have little faith in them.
27,157050220,Kim Fedeli,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,Call Jason Crow’s office. He is our Congressman for our 6th district here in Aurora. They have services that can help. 
28,157050220,Chuck H L.,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,Contact channel 9 I read that if anyone was having issues to contact them or visit their website. Its getting bad in my area too they wall thru here all night
29,157050220,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,The 9th circuit which is not ours ruled that camping bans are unconstitutional and then the Supreme Court refused to hear it and so that ruling stands. When the Denver courts ruled on Denver they cited the 9th circuit ruling. So it is unconstitutional to put in place camping bans if there is no other place for them to sleep. This is going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better. Thousands upon thousands of people are going to lose their homes in the upcoming months. You should have compassion because this could happen to you. Never say never
30,157050220,Donna Moody,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Aug,The government is to help people￼
31,157050220,Sarah Diem,• Hoffman Heights,5 Aug,"the amount of times I've read ""I feel for them/have empathy for them BUT..."" 🙄 you don't need to qualify your criticism, it doesn't soften what you're saying"
32,157050220,Leslie Taylor,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Aug,"I'm going to call the social Agencies and as many as possible, let's flood the police department with calls. Hopefully, there's strength in numbers."

0,159233626,Diann Osborne,• Mar Lee,25 Aug,I thought they want the same amount for environmental tax.
1,159233626,Gaar Potter,• Happy Canyon,25 Aug,That is correct. They are forcing us to vote NO repeatedly. They are ignoring their most important job (public safety) and doubling down on their socialist dreams.

5,159233626,Gaar Potter,• Happy Canyon,34w,Denver has proven with it's 10-year Road Home that it cannot responsibly undertake this function:
6,159233626,Peter M.,• Baker,25 Aug,"And it turns out that the building Denver purchased 3 years ago for homeless care is being utilized for that cause, effectively, by the Denver Rescue Mission."
7,159233626,Peter M.,• Baker,25 Aug,"The Denver Auditor, Tim O'Brian, has repeatedly pointed out some lack of clarity as to where the tax revenues from the sales of marijuana have been going. This is a lot of money.  So, until the 4 car garage of the house can be cleaned up and it's contents properly accounted for, why build another closet for storage, which will only get bigger."
8,159233626,Ola Zak,• University Park,25 Aug,I think last year we voted yes on tax for mental health for homeless population. Any report how how $ was/is used? Is it getting better.
9,159233626,George C.,• University Hills,34w,"Not to sound like negative Nancy,  but the more programs you create for homelessness the bigger the population of homeless gets. Just research San Francisco. "
10,159233626,Karen N.,• Hampden Heights East,25 Aug,"Ha! Well that explains the reason we have so many wild fires, too. We have sooooo many fire fighters so the fires just get bigger and bigger. You should write a book on cause and effect."
11,159233626,Colin Griffith,• South Park Hill,25 Aug,"The increase is small enough that it won't materially affect most  taxpayers, but it could make a difference for people unhoused people in need of support. But research has shown again and again that the only effective way to end homelessness is to create and guarantee housing, so this incremental effort isn't going to do anything to address the root of the problem."
12,159233626,John S.,• Krisana Park,25 Aug,Can you cite some of your references? I'd like to read more.
13,159233626,Diann Osborne,• Mar Lee,25 Aug,I love people debating homeless without rolling up their sleeves and talking to the real people that work tirelessly to help.
14,159233626,Cindy B.,• University Hills,26 Aug,"Until you have safe, stable housing, you can't address mental health!  It is circular.  One thing is for certain, ignoring the problem clearly doesn't make it go away."
15,159233626,Ann Brannan Joyce,• Holly Hills,26 Aug,NO
16,159233626,Sam Speight,• North Side,26 Aug,Anyone heard of or read the Denver Green Print Document?  It might interest the public to be aware of such things before voting for this. With the billions we've already dumped into solving this issue and the fact that it's only gotten much worse it seems logical to believe who ever controls these taxes for this purpose are either wildly incompetent or living well beyond their means. Either way I'd council a negative for this tax. And a much much smaller governing body.
17,159233626,John C.,• Berkeley Park,27 Aug,I won’t vote for any tax increase unless it involves abducting vagrant addicts and forcing them into rehab programs that they have to complete. If this violates civil liberties and the ACLU steps then I can’t vote for it. Programs should guarantee social stability at 90% or more. If I can’t see efficacy and enough upward mobility then I’d rather see tax dollars spent elsewhere.
18,159233626,John C.,• Berkeley Park,27 Aug,"Sam Speight I know what they’ve become. They represent a shell of constitutional rights and their lawyers seem to cherry pick the hot political issues. folks around here talk about helping the homeless addicts but it’s futile if people are in a place where they can’t help themselves or care to get help at all. Whether new homeless programs are passed or not, I predict it getting worse without recovery coercion."
19,159233626,Terry Hostetler,• Congress Park,27 Aug,When you start feeding the Bears you end with up dependent Bears that won’t work to feed themselves. As time goes by more and more dependent Bears arrive until there is so many you can’t feed them all. Then you will become the Bears food.
20,159233626,Florence Sebern,• VirginiaVillage/EllisCommAssoc,27 Aug,"According to the City Auditor’s report in 2014, Denver increased spending on The Road Home (Denver's homeless program) from $568,000 to $6,600,128 in the 10 years since it started -- nearly a twelve-fold increase. The problem has increased exponentially. The homeless budget for 2020 = $51 MILLION."
21,159233626,Scot D.,• Platt Park,28 Aug,Just say no. Our tax dollars do nothing to help this problem.

2,163316595,KR C.,• Mar Lee,3 Oct,Or help with addictions and jobs so they can get off the street?  This seems counterintuitive.  The “camp” won’t look like glamping forever.
3,163316595,CJ Steffen,• Hilltop,4 Oct,"""People experiencing homelessness would be supported in the camps with job, mental health, substance abuse and other counseling."""
4,163316595,Steve Paranawski,• Washington Park East,4 Oct,If sobriety isn’t a staple of the sanctioned camping plan (or any housing plan) it’s unfortunately not going to work.

7,163316595,NH Anderson,• Golden Triangle,28w,"Why can’t we work with other cities around the country and world which have put into place effective programs and services to alleviate the crisis of homelessness? There are successful examples out there, if only the politicians had the guts to come together and learn what works and what doesn’t. Instead, nothing is done in cities like Seattle and Denver.Lots of platitudes, no action.(edited)"
8,163316595,Angela Chronister,• Westwood,6 Oct,Seattle is definitely not an example of success.
9,163316595,Peter M.,• Baker,28w,"They'll need cameras with good night visibility function on poles 18' above the fencing, for the whose who of the local supply neighborhood.  Odds are good that they will be by as soon as the residents settle in.  This is just dish soap in a new basin over the same problem, not addressing the main issues; any crispness and clean start appearance will wash away and flood with the same staining of the former problem, in the streets, soon enough~  Sad to write it, but this will not help do anything but reduce more city funding, from public taxes, city, state, or federal.(edited)"

7,157571553,Robin Jones,• East Colfax,9 Aug,I walk around the area enough. I’ll look every day. I went back and didn’t see him to get a better look. A group of 20-year olds says he left

2,160008632,Cathy Van Blerkom,• Historic Montclair,1 Sep,"Montclair Elementary also regularly uses the park, for PE it seems. Of course not at the moment."
3,160008632,Susan Marshall,• Historic Montclair,1 Sep,"Only rarely have I seen Montclair Elementary using it, and that was primarily when the school field and playgrounds were not available due to the construction of the new classrooms."
4,160008632,Cathy Van Blerkom,• Historic Montclair,1 Sep,Susan Marshall
5,160008632,Susan Marshall,• Historic Montclair,1 Sep,"I filed a complaint yesterday with 311. I also emailed a complaint to the school from their website under the contact tab. I think everybody who is upset about this should also call 311 and also complain to the school. The person I spoke with at 311 said health inspectors would look into it. Please please if you have been as inconvenienced as I have and obviously other neighbors have, to file a complaint both with the City AND with the school."
6,160008632,Cathy Van Blerkom,• Historic Montclair,1 Sep,"Yeah, probably during construction. Being across from the park, I just noticed them a lot."
7,160008632,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,1 Sep,"Last school year montclair elementary was using it for recess because their playground was being worked on. I don't mind it, the school kids need to play also. If it happened to be the much older rowdier kids that came when we were there, we'd just go to one of the other several parks within walking distance. No big deal. And as far as the mask issue, I see kids playing in the playground all the time without masks, not just the schoolchildren."
8,160008632,Stephanie Schwartz,• Historic Montclair,2 Sep,"I would encourage people who are concerned to look at data and guidelines regarding masks for kids, especially outdoors."
9,160008632,Jennifer Hitchcock,• Historic Montclair,1 Sep,Glad to see I’m not alone in this. I definitely don’t mind if the students use the park but it needs to be in a way that is socially responsible and accommodating for everyone who wishes to be there. I filed a complaint with the parks this morning and was able to speak with an associate from the school this afternoon. They were very understanding. They said they were going to try what I suggested above: for the students to use the field area of the park rather than the playground. I’m hoping they can stick to it!
10,160008632,Jonathan Donley,• Mayfair,1 Sep,Playgrounds are open again? That’s good news!

12,160008632,Susan Marshall,• Historic Montclair,1 Sep,They are there before school too. Seems anytime I try to walk the dogs they are out there. No social distancing. No masks. Not even the adults.
13,160008632,Jan H.,• Lowry,1 Sep,It seems that they can't be too smart at Einstein Academy if they are not following CDC guidelines for COVID-19!
14,160008632,Stephanie Schwartz,• Historic Montclair,2 Sep,"I have spoken with them, and they are following all CDC recommendations. The CDC says students should NOT wear masks while exercising. They have detailed COVID protocols that they follow, and they are willing to share with anyone interested."
15,160008632,Tayo Shepard McGuirk,• South Park Hill,1 Sep,Why not contact the school’s administrator and see if the concerned community members can reach an agreement with the school that works for everyone involved?
16,160008632,Julie Szpira,• Historic Montclair,1 Sep,"I was hesitant because it doesn’t REALLY affect me, but I had similar concerns as what others have mentioned. "
17,160008632,Susan Marshall,• Historic Montclair,2 Sep,That solves part of the problem but far from most. More conversation needed.
18,160008632,Ray Maestas,• East Colfax,2 Sep,"You're lucky only kids are dominating. Other parks have homeless tents surrounding the park and people drinking, smoking dope, needles all over, ugly.  People are also wandering around asking for cigs, money, and just staring at the children. Very weird.Forget having a bite to eat or a picnic. Denver , Aurora, all over."
19,160008632,Beth Colwell,• South Park Hill,2 Sep,Report them!  Homeless need a place but not on the playgrounds or small parks.  If you have any masks give them some.
20,160008632,Aubrey Markson,• Historic Montclair,2 Sep,I go there all the time with my twin one year olds. Doesn’t bother me. It’s a public park? I very rarely see non-school visitors using masks themselves.
21,160008632,Stephanie Schwartz,• Historic Montclair,2 Sep,"I would encourage anyone who has challenges with the school to reach out directly to them. I have found them to be really nice, thoughtful people who genuinely care. I don't believe this thread and this type of talk is helpful at all."
22,160008632,Stephanie Schwartz,• Historic Montclair,2 Sep,"I have to say, now that I've read this thread that most of this makes me really upset with our community. The people at Einstein Academy screen their kids and faculty members for illness several times a day, sanitize hands 8-10 times a day, and have asked their entire community to take a pledge to keep the community safe. I think they have gone above and beyond, and it doesn't seem like we are being the welcoming neighbors we could be. Shame on us."
23,160008632,Aubrey Markson,• Historic Montclair,2 Sep,It does help to know the school’s recess times though if you want to avoid the older kids. Thank you Jennifer for posting that information!
24,160008632,Jan H.,• Lowry,2 Sep,"I called 311 and explained the current situation at Montclair Park, and they created a case #4790664 . Jaztine filed my case and then calls ""the Park Rangers"", as this team oversees the parks, in this situation. For example, she told me that there is an active restriction of not greater than 10 kids/adults at one time, etc. The P. Rangers will address these issues as needed with Dept of Health, etc."
25,160008632,Stephanie Schwartz,• Historic Montclair,2 Sep,"Just wanted to share that I just shared this thread with one of the school's co-founders, and this was the response I got from her: ""Oh, wow! We had no idea our using the park was such a problem for the community. We've only heard from one person via email and one person called yesterday, and I am not on Nextdoor, really, so there's no way for me to follow that thread. It's disappointing to hear that people think we are being irresponsible after all of the many many conversations we've had with community members and Parks & Rec and different health professionals over the last several months, but we obviously weren't able to speak with everyone before the school year began. Please please please ask anyone with concerns to reach out to me directly. We are more than happy to engage in a mutually-respectful conversation and try to come up with a win-win solution that works for everyone. Ultimately, we can only work on problems of which we are aware and partner with people who are willing to dialog with us. """
26,160008632,Susan Marshall,• Historic Montclair,2 Sep,I also let them know about this thread this morning as I thought they should know how some in the community felt about this.
27,160008632,Angie H.,• Historic Montclair,2 Sep,Please let them know that there are people who live on the park that love seeing them out there - all the kids are happy and laughing and it’s great!
28,160008632,Angie H.,• Historic Montclair,2 Sep,"Wow. Guess I’m strange. I live across from the park and we sit out and drink our coffee on the porch every morning. I was just so happy for those kids that they were out of their houses with their friends, in the open air, learning and playing. Didn’t even occur to me to be upset about it."
29,160008632,Jan H.,• Lowry,33w,Stephanie you seem to have an  over-investment in the resultant outcome rather than allowing those that have the authority to evaluate the situation to make the decisions on behalf of the the entire community. Do your friends own Einstein Academy or do you have some other undisclosed relationship with them? Your “over-selling” of the school’s reported compliance with COVID recommendations inside the School and your “notification” of the school by telling them what is in ND is clearly intended to “protect” them. 
30,160008632,Stephanie Schwartz,• Historic Montclair,3 Sep,"I just know that I've had several conversations with them over the last several months, something I doubt any of you have done. I was a concerned neighbor when I heard a school was coming, and I wanted to make sure my young children were safe, so I made a point to get to know them. Maybe I am trying to protect them because I've seen the work they've done, and I know the potential they have to positively impact the community. They have been more than happy to make time for me and address my concerns, and they have no reason to do so. I just think it's far more productive to have real conversations and give people the benefit of the doubt than run around spreading rumors and gossiping about things when we don't know the facts. But, sure, let the ""authorities"" decide. I'm sure they'll see what I've learned."
31,160008632,Jan H.,• Lowry,3 Sep,"Stephanie- When people post about their concerns on ND about what a school/a business or anyone is doing in their community and they ask for input from others, and get a variety of responses and hear what other people have seen and done to assess a situation, that is not called ""spreading rumors and gossiping"".

1,161523641,Kim LaClair,• East Colfax,15 Sep,ARC donation off E Colfax?
2,161523641,Andrea O'Brien,• City Park,15 Sep,If they’re in bad shape put them in the alley on the next scheduled day for extra trash pick up by the city.  There is no charge.
3,161523641,Lisa Ryckman,• Central Park,15 Sep,"If they’re in decent shape, post them on nextdoor or Craigslist under free stuff. They’ll be gone in a flash."
4,161523641,Barb Sagel,• Congress Park,16 Sep,https://www.thegoodusedcouch.com/donate-your-couch/  They will pick up and give a donation to Co Coalition for the Homeless.  I donated a couch about a year ago and it was painless.  They do sell them at their store.
5,161523641,Lindsay Lawson,• East Colfax,16 Sep,My boyfriend has junk removal company.
6,161523641,LAWRENCE WILSON,• Northeast Park Hill,31w,On this one joe I would go with bulk item pick up if it’s available in your area..that or donate them to Salvation Army or goodwill or ARC . if not then check the other avenues(edited)
7,161523641,Ingrid Underwood,• South Park Hill,18 Sep,"If the frame is in decent shape, someone could reupholster them.  It is sometimes cheaper to reupholster than to buy new couches.   Otherwise, post them as free on Nextdoor, Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace and set in the alley or front yard with a free sign.  They will be picked up by someone!  Some of the donation places will pick up - some are free and some are for a fee.  You have to check their websites.  We had several desks and dressers and they were very selective about what they took and had to be small enough that ONE person could move it.  Some are not doing pickups at all due to Covid."
0,160878572,Gaar Potter,• Happy Canyon,9 Sep,I read somewhere that if I mail my Census Form...the Post Office might be too busy to get it to you by the deadline. Do you have any drop boxes?
1,160878572,Halyna N.,• Peterson Road,9 Sep,"Just fill it out online, it takes a few minutes."
2,160878572,Leslie L.,• Sunny Side Manitou,9 Sep,is there a way to confirm that the information was received? I filled the form out on line and yet a census worker came by our house last weekend......
3,160878572,Suzanne S.,• Struthers Ranch,9 Sep,"There are a couple of reasons why a worker stopped by.. might be something very minor, checking on a non responsive neighbor."

5,160878572,Mark Yaw,• Mayfair,32w,"A Census taker with ID was out canvassing today.  I explained I had filed mine online months ago. She started asking direct questions about my neighbors. This is not Russia, I respect my neighbors' privacy, and I consider this an unwelcome intrusion. Scary stuff.(edited)"
6,160878572,Kevin L.,• Berkeley-Regis,9 Sep,Wow being asked if neighbors live by you. Yeah bro sounds like a real scary situation! 🙄🙄. Try not to stay up tonight scared about it. I’m baffled by people’s negative reactions on census. Don’t you want your neighbors to be counted as well as yourself?
7,160878572,Debbie Wade,• Tava Waters,9 Sep,I sent mine in way back before the lockdown and I have received many things in the mail saying it’s the law to respond to the census as well as calls . Then when you call the number it says there is no way to verify they received it .
8,160878572,Halyna N.,• Peterson Road,10 Sep,The mass mailers are just that. It's cheaper to send out to everyone than to check who already responded.
9,160878572,Jonna P.,• Downtown Fountain,32w,No need to come to my house we are done it  online(edited)

12,160878572,Marie R.,• Central Woodmoor,10 Sep,I think they extended the deadline due to Covid
13,160878572,STEVE HARLEY,• Baker,9 Sep,"here we go again; Julie, Community Engagement Team i was happy when comments were closed on a couple of recent posts"
14,160878572,Roxie M S.,• Harvest Ridge,9 Sep,"They can not see our comments, we have asked them to close the posts, obviously a ""no go"" or hit and miss on that subject.  I will monitor for improper posts as best as possible."
15,160878572,Jeffrey Sturman,• CBD,9 Sep,Should I complete the census twice like the pres said I should vote twice?
16,160878572,Gayle N.,• Upper Skyway,9 Sep,You are kidding. Lets have respect. Please! President Trump was just asking you to make sure your vote was counted and not thrown out by the Democrats!!!
17,160878572,Robin L.,• Belcaro,32w,"Somehow some folks here don't understand that the U.S. Census began shortly after President Washington took office. We are Americans and need to be counted. Don't make this institution into something political. Think of participating in the Census as important as voting, except that it only happens every ten years. Come on, you can do this successfully 5 times in your adult life without complaining, can't you?(edited)"
18,160878572,Deon G.,• Wash Park West,10 Sep,"Well said. I have worked every census since college, and you’re right – people don’t understand how critical a complete count is. It is so much more than redistricting, and those who are typically undercounted go without the services they need."
19,160878572,Bob & Pam F.,• Pine Creek,9 Sep,LOL
20,160878572,Kevin L.,• Berkeley-Regis,9 Sep,"Mark Y. Your own words: “an unwelcome intrusion” “This is not Russia” “Scary stuff”.  YOUR words, not mine lol. Covid and climate change are both hoaxes too, right? Lol"
21,160878572,Kendra Gibbs,• Harvey Park,10 Sep,Lynn L. What does MAGA even mean? What time in America are Trump supporters trying to return to? I’m asking out of curiosity because no one has ever been able to give me an answer.
22,160878572,Paul M.,• University Hills,9 Sep,"What have the census workers been doing all summer?  They have had five months to visit all non-responding addresses in their assigned areas.  Or perhaps someone at the office is exceptionally slow to update the outstanding address list?  Either way, this seems like a management incompetence issue so typical of government operations."
23,160878572,Casey E.,• Cragmor,10 Sep,They purposely wait to allow people time to voluntarily complete the census. That info is available to you.
24,160878572,Ann H.,• Jackson Creek,10 Sep,I thought this forum was for real people who live here
25,160878572,Robin L.,• Belcaro,10 Sep,I am real and I do live here.

WTH???? When I say I don't know, then I DON'T KNOW!!!"
28,160878572,Lynn Buschhoff,• Union Station,10 Sep,"I believe you. As David Brooks notes in The Second Mountain, one of the victims of the past three decades of urban planning is the community. It used to be the community that taught , nourished and supported each other. Now we live in isolation and have to turn to government and ngo's for community. It is no wonder you don,t know your community, especially during a pandemic.  Judging from the previous snarky comments in this thread, it is going to take a lot of forgiveness before we can reweave a strong sense of community in this country. At least people are talking , though I wish they weren,t so busy playing the blame game."
29,160878572,Ruth P.,• Palmer Park,10 Sep,It makes me sad that something so important as the Census which determines how federal monies and representation of the people has to become so political.  You are asked a few simple questions.  What are you trying to hide?
30,160878572,Laura E.,• Security,10 Sep,"Even if I do know anything about my neighbors, I'm not telling anyone.  That is my neighbor's business, not mine."
31,160878572,Dena P.,• Hampden Heights East,10 Sep,"It's nothing personal. This is a constitutional mandate. It's like, how many people live there and things like that. It helps them be counted so there are enough roads and bridges and schools. Nobody is coming for them in the night or anything."
32,160878572,Ossie R.,• Alamo Placita,10 Sep,I don't recall questions about my neighbors
33,160878572,Laura H.,• Jackson Creek,10 Sep,If they can't get a hold of someone they then go to their neighbors to at least get a head count of how many were living in the residents on April 1. My neighbor was out of town due to his father in law being sick then passing away.  So i had someone knocking on my door to get their info.
34,160878572,Rosie B.,• Old Colorado City,32w,I called the Regional Census office in Dallas and spoke with a very nice lady.  she said the enumerators (census takers) are allowed to ask certain questions about your neighbors if they cannot get in touch with them.  She suggested to call our local office if you have any questions - 719-257-5049.  I also discussed the problems with people posting comments and using this as a political forum - Again - she suggested calling the local office.(edited)

9,159293702,Liz LaRue,• Northeast Park Hill,26 Aug,"We were feeding a poor homeless kitty. We set up a winter spot for him, he'd come to the kitchen window for snacks, we even took him to the vet for a check up...and then we found out we had been hoodwinked by ""Cheddar"". The actual owner was walking around calling him and I asked her what he looked like. I had to bring her into our backyard where Cheddar was laying in the sun under our awning. We still see him although I suspect the thrill of the ruse has worn off since we now know what he's been up to because we don't see him except for a couple times a week now."

23,159293702,Samantha Menard,• Historic Montclair,34w,"Our indoor/outdoor kitty, Stan lives part time with a couple of neighbors. If he isn’t home by curfew we assume he is at one familiar home or another. There have been two instances where he went missing for several days and he had been trapped inside these houses while the homeowner was out of town or had out of town guests who assumed he lived there. They both have other cats, so food and water were available and he had opportunities to leave, but didn’t. We just figure he is community kitty, but we pay his bills. It sounds to me as if you also have a similar situation.(edited)"

9,160096746,Paige Burkeholder,• Southmoor Park East,5 Sep,CPD is proposing a Group Living Amendment #7 that will not only significantly increases the number of residents allowed in a residential home but also allows for Community Corrections (felons in the system) and 24/7 homeless shelters in Denver residential neighborhoods.  Buffer zones from schools will be removed.  Permitting for additional residents will no longer be required.  Notifications will be given but not the ability to approve or deny.

4,162690330,Jeff Krump,• Windsor East,28 Sep,This is not the role of government. City council has enough on their plate. Deal with the homeless problem or the protestors who are damaging property. No restaurant nor patron is forced to use the delivery service.  If the price is too much people and restaurants will quit using the service.
5,162690330,Cynthia Ivers,• Lowry,29 Sep,Should be supply and demand. This is not the role of govt.

1,174845976,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,25 Jan,"Probably because it's the access to their store, the only business currently open at that location."
2,174845976,Ashley Dancho,• Central Park,25 Jan,"Exactly, I called and spoke with the Sprouts GM this AM and she was appalled, had no idea this had been going on for months and they are often placed directly at the exit intersection where all their customers drive over.  She wants the landlord of the shopping mall to get involved, then they, they will do what they can to help."
3,174845976,Sarah Makarechian,• Central Park,25 Jan,So messed up.
4,174845976,Bobby Yocum,• Central Park,25 Jan,If this is a recurring event someone should point a camera in that direction to figure out what's going on.
5,174845976,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,25 Jan,"I hope someone from the store reads this and does it. That would go a long way to stopping the problem, wouldn't it?"

11,174845976,Ashley Dancho,• Central Park,25 Jan,I am sorry to hear this Theresa Venters - it is really worrying to me that this has gone on so long with so many affected.
12,174845976,Ashley Dancho,• Central Park,26 Jan,Theresa Venters if you frequent this area of 35th and think you got nails in your tire from there then I would encourage you to report it.  The information to do so is listed above.

When I'm on my bike or walking, I pick up every nail or screw or any other weird metal chunks in the road that I see. I figure one less flat is always a good thing! I find quite a lot, and hope that by picking them up every time I see them it will make a difference. Lots of construction going on everywhere in Denver, so I'm sure that's a big part of where they come from!"
17,174845976,Yvette Johnson,• Central Park,25 Jan,Thanks for sharing. So this is basically in front of Sprouts?
18,174845976,Ashley Dancho,• Central Park,25 Jan,All along 35th in both directions eastbound and westbound and they have been predominantly between Quebec and CPB but it seems others have found them East of CPB in the community as well.
19,174845976,Lesley Lochhead,• Lowry,25 Jan,If this has happened more than once it really seems like this isn't an accidental drop of nails by a construction truck or whatever. I agree with the person  who said sprouts should turn a camera to view that area.

32,174845976,Steve Haddock,• Central Park,11 Mar,Correction black screws
33,174845976,Steve Haddock,• Central Park,11 Mar,I found 2 screws in my wife’s car last week. Unfortunately it was in side wall resulting in having to buy new $400 tire. 
34,174845976,Ashley Dancho,• Central Park,12 Mar,"I am sorry Steve, please be sure to save your documentation, report it to your local precinct and anytime you see these Sprouts has asked that their GM be notified via her call right away. Khadija 720.629.5104."
35,174845976,Mike Alexander,• Hoffman Heights,13 Mar,"This doesn't help the core problem, but may save you all money. Go to the automotive section in Walmart or any auto parts store and buy tire plugs. As long as the nail goes through the tread and not the sidewall, plugs will fix your tire so it doesn't need to be replaced. Plugs will often last for the life of your tire. I've used them for a long as I've been driving (which is longer than I care to admit)."
0,159174214,Yesenia Castillo,• Aurora Arts District,24 Aug,Unbelievable!!! 😡😡
1,159174214,Cathy Bann,• South Hilltop,24 Aug,Very sad people are just getting more crazy in this world
2,159174214,Carri King-Bussard,• Lyn Knoll,25 Aug,That stinks! People behaving badly definitely seems to be on the rise.
3,159174214,Lisa Betchey,• Lowry,25 Aug,Hungry people are on the rise.  Not sure this guy is one of them.
4,159174214,Karen Hardy,• Lyn Knoll,25 Aug,An outright thief!  Where is common decency any more?! 😢
5,159174214,Morris Yarnell,• Windsor East,25 Aug,I think it is only going to get worse as people get more desperate. Something stolen for free that will garner the thief some money is seemingly worth the chance that getting caught brings.
6,159174214,Ling Ling,• Legends at Lowry,25 Aug,I hope he gets the rona virus 😠
7,159174214,Susan Deardorff,• Tava Waters,25 Aug,Did you show this to the police?
8,159174214,Chris Smith,• Central Park,25 Aug,I don’t get how people think this would be ok.
9,159174214,Nikki But,• Del Mar Parkway,25 Aug,I saw guy (homeless) on the corner of I-225 and 6th ave with a sign asking for money. Looks exactly like the guy in the video.
10,159174214,Maheen Abidi,• Congress Park,25 Aug,i would show it to the police. They will ask for the video.
11,159174214,Rob Den,• Tava Waters,26 Aug,Why did you leave the packages on the porch  ?
12,159174214,andrew nuntapreda,• Historic Montclair,26 Aug,That's an ignorant comment.
0,166409310,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,31 Oct,"Does she need to have her pantry filled? If so I can totally help with that, let me know"
1,166409310,Jessica Webb,• South Park Hill,1 Nov,Hi Telmahury - I think that would be super helpful for her! Getting her stocked up on pantry basics would be great. I’ll DM you.
2,166409310,Jane Skarka,• Mayfair,1 Nov,I’m sure I could get it in to my van. Happy to help.
3,166409310,Jane Skarka,• Mayfair,1 Nov,I could probably get both items at the same time.
4,166409310,Jane Skarka,• Mayfair,1 Nov,"Sorry, Jessica, something has come up, so I won’t be able to help tomorrow, after all."
5,166409310,Jessica Webb,• South Park Hill,1 Nov,Hi Jane! Thank you so much for reaching out. Any chance you could do it Tuesday morning?
6,166409310,Chad Baker,• Skyland,24w,"Hello! I havent a truck. But I do have an SUV that i'm sure we could get loaded up and delivered. However, the earliest I could be available is Wednesday afternoon.(edited)"
0,160556626,Veronica Barahona - Ziegler,• Central Park,6 Sep,Unfortunately you have to go thru the eviction process.
1,160556626,Linda Hendrick,• Historic Montclair,6 Sep,"The entire process can take up to 90-days. Please read up, because you need to follow up EXACTLY as the law requires in order to get them out. If you follow the rules, the Sheriff will come and personally evict them at the end of 90-days, but you have to get the ball rolling by crossing your t's and dotting your i's! BTW, Trump has been trying to pass some kind of Exec Order that no one can get evicted until after the 1st of the year, but I don't think he's gotten it through yet."
2,160556626,marcia jones,• Mayfair,6 Sep,I also think the governor and mayor are against evictions at this time.  People can't find work and the homeless situation is getting worse.  I think you have to go through the eviction process.
3,160556626,Terri Moore,• Historic Montclair,6 Sep,He had over 30 days to find a place. We have been told that other family members have offered to take him in and he refuses.
4,160556626,Jacqueline Bell,• Central Park,6 Sep,My sister had squatters at the home she listed. She paid them off and they left.
5,160556626,Melissa Jaure,• East Colfax,18 Sep,From what she explained it doesn’t appear he is a squatter 1 2 as a tenant he has rights! A lot of them. It would be cheaper to pay 3 -6 months of rent payments to him then going through the process 3) there is government orders due to pandemic. 4) there are laws that govern the transaction itself.5) super bad karma to put a human being out right now 6) consider renting to him at least until the end of year
6,160556626,Kirk Wayland,• Mayfair,6 Sep,Never on the lease means he’s just squatting and therefore trespassing.....but I’m no expert.
7,160556626,Terri Moore,• Historic Montclair,6 Sep,I agree but have been told that is not how it works. Makes no sense but then what does these days?
8,160556626,Tree Wallace,• East Colfax,6 Sep,If his name isn’t on the  lease how does he have any right to b there? He’s a squatter! How can the police not do anything?  Sounds like u need legal advice.  So sorry! Can u appeal to the sister to help u out?
9,160556626,Terri Moore,• Historic Montclair,32w,That is what I thought too. We don't have any extra money at this point. We needed to sell the properties to pay my mothers care. He had a month to find a place and we were also told that other relatives have offered to take him in but he refuses.(edited)
10,160556626,Gretchen Koehler,• Mayfair,6 Sep,I agree with Kirk and Jacqueline.  If you want this solved fast make him an offer..  https://ipropertymanagement.com/laws/colorado-squatters-rights
11,160556626,Terri Moore,• Historic Montclair,6 Sep,unfortunately there is no extra money to do that. This is why we are selling them. Thanks for the link though.
12,160556626,Caitlin Padalka,• Lowry,6 Sep,I mean I’m not sure what the Mortage cost is but if it’s going to cost you one more mortgage payment for the 30 days it takes to evict him plus the court cost. He may leave for like $500 or $1000 and no eviction on his record. If you think about it makes more sense to try a low amount buy out.
13,160556626,Terri Moore,• Historic Montclair,7 Sep,You are right about that. He wants $2000.00 to leave. It is ridiculous but looks like we don't really have another choice at this point we need to close on these ASAP. My mother needs that money for her care. This is extortion and still not right. I cannot believe there is nothing the law can do to protect us from this happening.
14,160556626,Deborah Stough,• South Park Hill,7 Sep,Pay them
15,160556626,Terri Moore,• Historic Montclair,7 Sep,Looks like that is what we are going to have to do. I cannot believe that it has come down to this. It is extortion!
16,160556626,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,8 Sep,I disagree. If he says he wants $2000 you tell him you don’t have that much and can give him $300 to get out
17,160556626,Jan Rehfuss,• Lowry,7 Sep,Can you just watch the house until he leaves and then just change the locks?
18,160556626,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,7 Sep,Haha thats brillant
19,160556626,Liz Gordon,• Central Park,7 Sep,I second the change the locks idea. You could always call the non-emergent police dispatch to request and escort while you have the locks changed.
20,160556626,Terri Moore,• Historic Montclair,7 Sep,We will be doing that as soon as he signs the paper saying he agrees to vacate. We are going to have to pay him to do that now though which horrible. It is extortion and I don't know how that is even legal.
21,160556626,Christina Ulster,• East Colfax,7 Sep,Trump’s order only applies to people who can’t pay rent because of the pandemic. You should still be able evict people for cause (in this case squatting in your house).
22,160556626,Terri Moore,• Historic Montclair,7 Sep,I completely agree and he has been offered a place to stay he refuses to go until he gets money. It is so infuriating!!
23,160556626,Christina Ulster,• East Colfax,7 Sep,I’m honestly surprised that you can’t have him arrested for criminal trespass since he was not on the lease. Sorry you’re dealing with this added stress at what I’m sure is already a stressful time.
24,160556626,Terri Moore,• Historic Montclair,7 Sep,Me too! Thanks. Yes things were already stressful enough this the last thing we needed on top of it.
25,160556626,Jill Jacobs,• Lowry,7 Sep,"Under Colorado law if a person is allowed into a house with permission originally, then the person is not a squatter even if that person isn’t on the lease.  You can’t change the locks when you have someone living in your property because self help is not available in Colorado. Instead, you have to go through the eviction process or work out a deal so that the person voluntary leaves. Make sure that you give him the money only when he hands you the keys.  Just hoping to add some clarity from a real estate lawyer..."
26,160556626,Jan H.,• Lowry,7 Sep,"So the person on the lease, is the one who is allowed to let someone in (the brother). The owner of the property is NOT the one who is legally given the right to grant permission or not?"
27,160556626,Crystal Andersson,• South Park Hill,7 Sep,If it’s your property you should move in too. It’ll get really uncomfortable for him real quick.
28,160556626,Crystal Andersson,• South Park Hill,7 Sep,...and bring some large slumber party buddies.
29,160556626,Leanne Fosbre,• Hilltop,7 Sep,Brillaint!
30,160556626,Cynthia Ivers,• Lowry,7 Sep,"If you really want to close, can you pay him to leave?"
31,160556626,Jan H.,• Lowry,7 Sep,Thats the issue- He wants $2000 to leave the house but he has no business even being in there!
32,160556626,Crystal Andersson,• South Park Hill,7 Sep,Turn the water off and he’ll be out  of the house within a day or two tops.
33,160556626,Patrick Mann,• Central Park,7 Sep,Sorry but you can’t do that either.  This dude has more rights than the owners at this point.
34,160556626,Kimberly C.,• East Colfax,8 Sep,Maybe if he wants $$ you can verbally tell him you’ll pay him what he wants $2k? And then just don’t? Idk if he’s going to be shady then that seems fair 🤷🏻‍♀️
35,160556626,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,8 Sep,I’d definitely try to think of some way to cheat him or double cross him. He should NOT be able to get away with scamming people
36,160556626,Melissa Jaure,• East Colfax,18 Sep,Yikes then what if he can sue her for ten times the amount !!! Shady doesn’t get to be shady back no bad vibes or bad karma
37,160556626,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,32w,Go to the Wellington Web building you can file for a legal eviction without an attorney.  Your tenant will be served with a court date and he’ll know you mean business without black mailing you.  Won’t take 30 days.(edited)
38,160556626,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,32w,Worth a try. Just say he’s a squatter who won’t leave and is trying to extort money from you(edited)
0,171290132,James West,• Lowry,19 Dec,Where in AZ? I came here from Tucson like 21 years ago. They usually have them at any basic carneceria. There’s a decent one at Iliff and Quebec.

18,171290132,Kim Brown,• Lowry,20 Dec,Little Anitas on Colorado Blvd
19,171290132,Karylle Silva,• Mayfair,20 Dec,We always have have tamales and posole on Christmas eve. Pampa said it was because we have something to unwrap. I kill the posole. I do tamales with red chile I get in new Mexico. It really isn't that hard and I find it soothing to spend some time doing it. I have extra red chilies if you would like. The corn wraps and masa are cheap at most grocery stores. You can do this.
20,171290132,Karylle Silva,• Mayfair,20 Dec,Oh and also the thing about homemade is you can control sauce to meat ratio and masa thickness
21,171290132,Omar Cisneros,• Central Park,22 Dec,El Tamalero is an Aurora staple for sure. Gotta get there super early if you want the good stuff though.
22,171290132,Bobby Martinez,• Northeast Park Hill,24 Dec,How funny I'm from Tucson to I got here in 2005 . I would love to have some good tamales .

0,177817757,Andrew Adamsbaum,• Beeler Park,20 Feb,"Hi Paulina.  That's great that you guys are getting into some outdoor adventures!  Will you be camping or backpacking?  Forgive me if you already know this, but backpacking means parking the car and carrying all your stuff on your back to your campsite, while camping might mean driving to a campsite and unloading directly from the car for the night.  Both are fun, but the requirements are pretty different, the big difference being you'll want to be a lot more weight-conscious for backpacking as the pounds you carry add up fast.  For example, when my girlfriend and I go backpacking with our dog, we all cram into a 2-person tent just because it'll save us 2-4lbs."
1,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,• Northeast Park Hill,20 Feb,Thank you so much for all this info Andrew Adamsbaum! For now we plan to camp not backpack but perhaps one day we will graduate to that adventure! My husband was looking at the Northface Dolomite   bag with 3 layers for different temps. in my opinion was a little pricey ($200) but what do I know. That said it’s synthetic and based on what you said I think we def would prefer down since we both get cold easily. We have been looking at inflatable pads so will def look into the Neo. I know the pad makes a lot of difference! 
2,177817757,Jane Pacheco,• Elyria Swansea,10 Mar,"Such helpful info, thanks!"
3,177817757,Kimberly Pugh,• Northeast Park Hill,20 Feb,My suggestion from a person that loves to camp. Is to get the Colman cot. They fold up into a bag and keeps you off the ground. Easy to put stuff under as well.
4,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,• Northeast Park Hill,20 Feb,Ooooooh I think we would like this a lot. Thank you Kimberly Pugh! Will look into it.

9,177817757,Carrie Lambert,• Skyland,20 Feb,"Sierra Trading Post over on the west side of town has great deals on quality equipment!

13,177817757,Katie Erickson,• North Park Hill,20 Feb,"We have down Nemo bags, the men’s and women’s have zippers on opposite sides so you can zip them together, down is more expensive up front but lasts longer if you take care of it, keep an eye on REI sales, I think we got our bags for 30% off. And klymit for a pad! They have several 2 person pads that work for backpacking too, if you decide to go for it."
14,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,• Northeast Park Hill,21 Feb,"Going to check out those Nemo bags, thank you!"
15,177817757,Anthony Howlett,• Central Park,20 Feb,"a single sleeping bag is MUCH warmer than zipping two together because you can close it up around you and keep in your body heat. I second a cot also, the difference in temperature 24"" above the ground as opposed to on the ground is significant and you can put your stuff underneath. Which probably doesn't sound too important but when you are looking for a flash light and shoes in the pitch black ,to go to the bathroom, it's huge! Enjoy!"
16,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,• Northeast Park Hill,21 Feb,I think I’m sold on the cot! Thank you!
17,177817757,Ingrid Underwood,• South Park Hill,8w,A couple camping tips:
18,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,• Northeast Park Hill,21 Feb,Wow thank you for all of these! I’m bookmarking this all! I really appreciate this in depth list. stuff we never thought of!
19,177817757,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,21 Feb,"REI has such great options, and if you get their store brand, it has a lifetime warranty. Down sleeping bags (to 20F) are good for many seasons (not winter), and you can keep them zipped open in warmer months...down is so versatile for camping in Colorado and even in Utah (which still has 4K altitude and cooler temps at night). That store also has some used gear."
20,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,• Northeast Park Hill,21 Feb,Didn’t know about they lifetime warranty so I think we’ll def be going there and if anything will use it for research!
21,177817757,Christina Swanson,• North Park Hill,21 Feb,Nemo has a two person sleeping bag.
22,177817757,Nate Hull,• Skyland,22 Feb,"If you're just getting into this, and initially only pursuing warm weather camping, I'd start with something super cheap to make sure this is something you can't live without before investing in really high quality gear. For years I used to get everything from Walmart or Big5 until I realized how often I use and need to replace this stuff."
23,177817757,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,22 Feb,"That approach makes sense if you can afford to keep replacing (and donate the old stuff). Or, since Paulina has outdoor goals, it might be best to get something better early on....which saves money and is more environmentally sustainable in the long run ."
24,177817757,Carly Erickson,• Northeast Park Hill,22 Feb,"My husband and I both have Kelty Galactics. They can zip together to form a 2-person bag (I have the women's and he the men's so the women's bag side is two-ish inches shorter at the top.) We have used them zipped together but actually prefer to sleep our separate sleeping bags and then snuggle. We both feel like it is warmer that way. Depending on how your dog sleeps, you may want to get them their own sleeping bag as well. Our dog will not get in our bags, zipped together or separate."
25,177817757,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,22 Feb,A good sleeping pad is important to insulate for warmth if on the ground.
26,177817757,Maureen Upton,• Central Park,22 Feb,"LL Bean full-size 3” camp mattress is the bomb, great quality, totally insulates you froM Even frozen ground.  Takes up darn near whole tent but it’s just like cushy carpeting for our tent-home. And a string of battery-powered lights make it cozy, better than staring into each other’s blinding headlamps. We’ve got a nice camp"
27,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,• Northeast Park Hill,23 Feb,Thank you for the offer! We actually were gifted a stove so are all set there. Will check out the LL Bean mattress!
28,177817757,Paulina Piekarska-Leveillee,• Northeast Park Hill,10 Mar,"Hello everyone! I just wanted to thank everybody for their awesome suggestions and recommendations. It helped us tremendously. We set up our tent in our living room and tested out a great cot from our neighbor (thank you Maria Draco!) We decided a cot is not ideal for the sizing of our tent. We decided to go with the Klymit insulated Double V sleeping pad instead. Also based on everybody’s feedback, we decided to forgo a double sleeping bag and get individual ones. I will be getting the Nemo Forte 20. Very excited for our weekend trip to Moab in 3 weeks! Thank you again for sharing all your knowledge!"

We have all had a shitty year and these pieces of poop are scum that walk this earth!!

1,170363111,Tammy Simon,• Highland Park East,13 Dec,That's terriable! I would be afraid to put them up again.

14,170363111,Teresa Z.,• Expo Park,11 Dec,"I have seen people selling the Walmart blowups that are like 15$-20$ for 50$ online, some even still have the Walmart price in the pictures so I’m sure they could be selling them."
15,170363111,April Pogue,• Central Park,19w,See this post. Someone found Christmas decorations in their yard.(edited)
16,170363111,Jen Brunz,• Lyn Knoll,10 Dec,Wow. Losers! Can’t have anything nice.
17,170363111,Joe F.,• Cedar Cove,10 Dec,Well at least not outside. Every time I put out garden decor I always find it broken to pieces or stolen. I put out some yard lights and they lasted about two days I found them strewn all about the neighborhood. Smashed of course.
18,170363111,Joe F.,• Cedar Cove,10 Dec,There are a lot of idiots out there. But this honestly sounds like kids. I mean teenagers. They don't want the decorations they don't want to resell them. They just want to deny you your enjoyment of them.
19,170363111,Julie Kustic,• Hoffman Heights,11 Dec,Why can't people behave? It's hard enough as it is.

22,170363111,Carmen Calavera,• Hoffman Heights,16 Dec,What decorations did they take?
0,180320809,Joan Baronberg,• Hilltop,16 Mar,"Congrats and gratitude to you, Julie, for your caring and responsibility which helps us all."
1,180320809,Sandy Reddic,• Hilltop,16 Mar,Know your surroundings !!! It pays to know your neighbors & your neighborhood
2,180320809,Kim LaClair,• East Colfax,17 Mar,I agree...I would rather be called a nosey neighbor for always keeping an eye out.
3,180320809,Sandra Murray,• Historic Montclair,16 Mar,"Hi Julie...now I know what happened....gosh....yes, good neighbors really are important!  I have them too."
4,180320809,David Long,• Mayfair,16 Mar,"They likely only approached your place as a potential score because it was not shoveled. Similar to not mowing or overgrowth of weeds. Appears owners are on vacation. When your neighbor busted them, they provided an appropriate response even though they didn't have shovels. Nonetheless, even with them knowing they were under a watchful eye, they broke-in."
5,180320809,Julie Szpira,• Historic Montclair,16 Mar,Yup. That’s exactly what the police said. It was a crime of opportunity. 
6,180320809,Barb Banen,• East Colfax,5w,"Believe this is called “Trespassing on Pvt Property"". Might consider putting  a ""Hungry Attack Dog on Duty"" /or: ""Beware of Killer Katz from Outer Space👹"" sign on your outside gate or  other visible place on ""out""side of fence 🤔😉"
7,180320809,Alexis Carrington-Ford,• North Park Hill,16 Mar,Thanks for posting! Do you have small basement windows or are they large enough for someone to enter through?
8,180320809,Julie Szpira,• Historic Montclair,16 Mar,They’re  big!!!
9,180320809,Alexis Carrington-Ford,• North Park Hill,16 Mar,I ask only because our are rather small but I do wonder about break ins
10,180320809,Alexis Carrington-Ford,• North Park Hill,16 Mar,Gotcha. I like the nest or ring products as they have window sensors that will alert you if some tries to open a door or window. And if you are away they act a motion sensor as well. But I wonder if bars might be in order of they are large. I have both the best and ring products btw.
11,180320809,Glenn Godden,• Mayfair,16 Mar,But you're implying they are the ones that are responsible for all the break ins cause they can fit into small areas correct? Pretty big assumption on your part. Lots of skinny people of all races out there.
12,180320809,Gloria BURNS,• East Colfax,16 Mar,"Put a lock on your gate you can get bars for the basement windows or put in alarms if the window opens your neighbor will hear it, i put something in front of all my windows plants bottles anything to make noise the most important thing is to make it hard for them put a lock on your gate.what i want to do this summer is raise my gate make sure the smooth side is on the out side and to make real hard put wood on front and back so they don't have any thing to climb up on. we all need to go watch some home alone.Smile (peace)"
13,180320809,Terry Sipes,• Mayfair,16 Mar,"My bad if it came off like that, maybe I should have said the sneak thieves use their children to go through the window open the back door and let the parents, aunts, uncles do the work. That's not comforting to the woman that has small windows, or the people whom were shot on the Monaco/11th area as the strong arm men dressed up in orange vest and did a strong arm robbery gone bad, thank god for the police on that one... or the robbery/rape at high noon on 6th/Lyden last summer and on and on and on, no neighborhood is safe in Denver, but you can be smart about your surrondings, but be safe... "
14,180320809,Holly Kendrick,• Central Park,17 Mar,I highly recommend the Ring products and they are now introducing more features and at lower prices. I have a Ring doorbell in my front and Ring floodlights in my back alley. Besides my dog it is also a big deterrent. So sorry you’re home was damaged and someone robbed you. I’ve been robbed and my home has been broken into and it is so unnerving and emotional. Take care and your good neighbors can help be the extra eyes and watchdogs we need.

So it appears we are not smart enough to figure out....social distancing is what keeps people out of the hospital’s.  I will not be shopping at any more stores with hundreds of people.

0,171920300,Lori Walker,• East Washington Virginia Vale,26 Dec,"I'm not sure but I do believe it was a one time stimulus, unfortunately. I don't get political but I will say patience is a virtue. That bill wasn't great for americans, it was great for foreign countries though. I'm glad trump didn't sign and called for more stimulus, because honestly people need it. $600 wasn't going to get the job done for many"
1,171920300,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,27 Dec,Will get that bill through because there are enough of those to override Trump's silly veto. He's such an idiot
2,171920300,Terry Sipes,• Mayfair,27 Dec,"No, not enough people in the Senate to pass anything over the $900B, no veto coming from that group...sad but Trump is on a killing spree in more ways than on...he really felt he was a King and his subjects from us to senators to the homeless have not graveled enough for a scrap from his table..after 12 noon on 1-20-2021, he is officially gone as president anything (minutes) else is a coup d' 'etat... however we have two more hurdles before the official Trump exit, the first comes on January 06, 2021 when Pence reads and verifies the results from the resent States reading of Electoral votes, 306 to Biden,  the next hurdle is for Trump to physically move out of the White house, his Mar-a-lago residence is not a full time option via a clause in his agreement back in the 80's and 90's during renovations of the property which he purchased for $10M..the county is holding his feet to the fire on this one..ATS-Denver"
3,171920300,Jasmine Albrechtsen,• Tava Waters,26 Dec,Yes I have heard that $300 extra a week will be paid and there will also be back payments made of the $300 . Sorry I wish I had more details
4,171920300,Lori Walker,• East Washington Virginia Vale,26 Dec,Really? That would be great for everyone on unemployment for sure
5,171920300,Lori Walker,• East Washington Virginia Vale,26 Dec,"I do understand your frustrations though, times are going to get even harder on the american people and it's just sad that they can't get anything situated in the best interest of all of us😔"
6,171920300,Steph Wright,• Highland Park East,26 Dec,"I'm confused too. Is it a second one? Or, part of that 1st one??"
7,171920300,Jamie Tenace Tenace,• Lowry,26 Dec,Yeah I am confused. I’m not sure if there is a new one coming out from the state   Will try to call Colorado labor office     The 1st one was back a month or 2 ago but I thought I heard he was going to sign another exec order    Hope so !
8,171920300,Jessica Watson,• Tava Waters,27 Dec,Jamie Tenace Tenace there is not...its an extention of time not adding additional payments. Its for the new people filing and those who didn't receive the one time stimulus yet.
9,171920300,Nelly Garza,• Washington Virginia Vale,26 Dec,Thank you.
10,171920300,Jasmine Decelles,• East Colfax,26 Dec,Finally! A post to actually gain some good information from!! Thanks!
11,171920300,Jamie Tenace Tenace,• Lowry,26 Dec,Maybe that’s what it is   For people who didn’t get the 1st payment.  It’s so hard to talk to an actual person at the unemployment office     I guess at some point they will come out w/ more details.
12,171920300,Jessica Watson,• Tava Waters,27 Dec,Yes its an extention of time not additional funding. If you haven't received this give more time as well as for the people just filing.

14,171920300,Eddie James,• Lyn Knoll,27 Dec,"Something is always better than nothing when Americans are suffering from all that is happening in the world right now and thanks to Trump not signing, WE HAVE NOTHING!"
15,171920300,Jamie Tenace Tenace,• Lowry,27 Dec,Eddie   That’s exactly right !  Yeah $2000 is great but that’s the way I look at it    After all the negotiations to even get to an agreement that $600 is what they could do and the $300 and now to not sign that bill after people who need that $ immediately is just so messed up that it’s unbelievable.    Now it’s a step backwards!!       SAD !
16,171920300,Caitlin McIntyre,• Congress Park,27 Dec,"I believe the extension was put in place for those who just started collecting unemployment starting in November. The payment was set to give those who had applied for unemployment starting March-October, but since the rate of those filings went up starting in November, the governor extended that order to include those who filed starting in November or now. That way they can be included in that one time payment."
17,171920300,Jessica Watson,• Tava Waters,27 Dec,Yes exactly. Its and extention of time not additional funds.
18,171920300,Ben Miller,• Central Park,27 Dec,Amazon is hiring.  16$ an hr
19,171920300,Dan Roller,• Northeast Park Hill,27 Dec,That's great for all of the teenagers with no obligation or responsibilities.
20,171920300,Breanna Oneill,• Morris Heights,27 Dec,Honestly I've heard both ways. Idk... I get unemployment through TN and they denied me an extension. Like look here. Im in CO and a bartender... I have a daughter with an autoimmune disease... im a single mom who has exhausted all resources.... I was willing to settle for that little bit bc its SOMETHING.
21,171920300,Jessica Watson,• Tava Waters,27 Dec,You should apply for pandemic unemployment and you may be able to do that in co because your living here.
22,171920300,Jessica Watson,• Tava Waters,27 Dec,I'm sorry to say this because I sure hoped we would get it. HOWEVER this is an extention of time. It extends the time the money is available for unemployment to send out. It still remains a one time payment meaning if you have gotten it once thats it. If you haven't this gives you more time to get it and for them to give it to new people applying for unemployment right now. Hopefully they work this out quickly but be prepared for a hard January as even if a federal stimulus was passed it would be mid to late January before anyone saw money.
23,171920300,Anne Hagan,• Del Mar Parkway,27 Dec,I don’t know about unemployment but king supers is hiring like crazy and it’s a good great company due to it is 1 of many many companies that belong to Kroger and Kroger has real values and lots of upward potential
24,171920300,Anthony Howlett,• Central Park,27 Dec,"UPS is also hiring and Ball containers in Golden. again good companies ,pay well and room to move"
25,171920300,Jamie Tenace Tenace,• Lowry,27 Dec,Jessica thx for clarifying that. I guess it was wishful thinking or something.     Can only hope and pray something gets done to help struggling people !
26,171920300,Larissa Chmielewski,• Del Mar Parkway,27 Dec,"It was a time extension, not an additional payment.  Of course our federal government is just playing games right now and leaving everyone in a lurch.  Something will pass in the next few days or the government shuts down too.  Though congress still gets paid 🙄"
27,171920300,Jamie Tenace Tenace,• Lowry,27 Dec,Amen to that !!
28,171920300,Tina F.,• Legend Oaks,27 Dec,I talked to unemployment last week. My 26 weeks is up next month and my unemployment stops even though I have not been able to find a job . So I have absolutely no income. I don't qualify for the $375 they told me cause it is only for people that earn between $25-$300 a week on unemployment and I earned more than $300. Great system.
29,171920300,Tina F.,• Legend Oaks,27 Dec,Also they told me there are no extensions past today.
30,171920300,LAWRENCE WILSON,• Northeast Park Hill,27 Dec,Funny I have not received any payments

0,156960455,Bernice Murphy,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,"Shuffling homeless people around and banning them from ""our fancy neighborhood"" will not solve the societal problem."
1,156960455,DJ Leaderach,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,You’re right Bernice Murphy we need to put pressure on our elected officials to do their jobs!!! Solve the problem! Contact them!
2,156960455,Larry Clark,• Central Park,4 Aug,"I say let 'em have it!  We should ask the city to install porta-potties and wash station in there for them.   The land is just wasting away there, anyway."
3,156960455,DJ Leaderach,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,Nope. Wrong answer Larry Clark Clark. Easy for you to say since it’s not Central Park 👍🤦‍♂️
4,156960455,Larry Clark,• Central Park,4 Aug,"My understanding is that the area is completely fenced off, and not being used for anything, by anyone."
5,156960455,Michelle Olson,• North Park Hill,4 Aug,"Larry, I paid $410,000 for my 1sk home in 2018. What will my investment be worth next year?"
6,156960455,Brenda Thompson,• South Park Hill,4 Aug,I'm with you Larry. Porta-potties and trash bins. Plus a fence on the south border.
7,156960455,Michelle Olson,• North Park Hill,4 Aug,"Again, I just paid $410,000 for my 1ksf home in 2018. Who is going to pay for the loss that I will face from this encampment? I cannot afford this loss. This house is my retirement plan. I already need to work until I'm 75 just to retire.  I should just shoot myself right now because I will never ever be able to recover the loss that I will face from this."
8,156960455,Larry Clark,• Central Park,4 Aug,I'd go even further and recommend that the area be used to build housing & services for the homeless
9,156960455,Haley Johnson,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,"On 40th and Colorado there was housing built for the homeless a few years ago that is now experiencing lots of drugs, crime and violence and that is in an appartment!"
10,156960455,Yanka Skyton,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,Your recommendations are kind of irrelevant since your neither live nor have a voice in district 8. Maybe reach out to your local gov-t instead?
11,156960455,Larry Clark,• Central Park,4 Aug,"And ""yes"", I'd be willing to be taxed a bit more to help pay for it.  Assuming those kind of replies will be forthcoming..."
12,156960455,Mike McCumber,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,"Larry, how about offering up your backyard? I will pay for the porta potty and wash station. Deal ?"
13,156960455,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,7 Aug,Larry you can make a donation I don’t want to pay additional taxes on my county taxes I’m sure a lot don’t agree with additional taxes they just added for teachers and I’m sure Tay Anderson for his security aren’t we taxed enough pretty soon we will be taxed out.
14,156960455,DJ Leaderach,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,Again all people who dnt live right near it. People who live close don’t want it. Can’t you respect that??

17,156960455,Trinell Mack,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,I was wondering what happened to all of the encampments by sams club. Here we go....
18,156960455,Christina Roybal,• Clayton,4 Aug,Tonight drove by at 9pm and tents were all removed. I'm hoping someone from Denver City and County resolved this time.
19,156960455,Jessica Warren,• Clayton,5 Aug,I saw one tent yesterday right before sunset.
20,156960455,De hervey Hervey,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,what happened to the parking lot at the Colosseum that is not being used for any entertainment?
21,156960455,Suzzette F.,• North Park Hill,5 Aug,I received a response from the city and they informed me that the illegal camping should have been removed as of last night.
22,156960455,Jamie Reyes,• Northeast Park Hill,5 Aug,"The Park Hill golf course security team has been instructed to not allow anyone to camp there since after all, it is private property. Tents have been removed"
23,156960455,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,7 Aug,I assumed that the owner had approved since it had been known to Parkhill where did the rumors come from.  My concern would be as well that they may move to the neighborhood
24,156960455,Haley Johnson,• Northeast Park Hill,7 Aug,"Kathy Wright, all I will say is that  the Denver department of health did come  assess the golf course for a homeless camp. There was also a very small news article about it. Theres a lot of shady things going on. And it is still a possibility."
25,156960455,Daniel Pacheco,• Central Park,5 Aug,"The least we could do is stop calling it ""camping""."
26,156960455,Haley Johnson,• Northeast Park Hill,5 Aug,"The last time I checked, when you sleep in a tent, it's called camping. What do you call it, when you set up a tent in the mtns, near a lake, or even in your backyard???"
27,156960455,John Howe,• North Park Hill,5 Aug,Thank goodness.  I lost much sleep over this.

I told the guy I didn’t understand where the charge came from and he said my tires would take almost 3 hours to do, which is when I assumed he was not skilled at his job.

2,172200514,Karyn Manzanares,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,30 Dec,Nadine Rains do not pay that kind of money!! Just out of curiosity did you go alone? I’d say either way they we’re definitely about to rip you off! 😔
3,172200514,Celine Batiste,• Central Park,30 Dec,hello depending on what's wrong with your tire if there's a hole in it it can be patched and aired up and that is about $100 just give you a heads up

11,172200514,Karyn Manzanares,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,30 Dec,"Look into Snap Finance. They only work with certain tire shops like Big O and that’s where we get tires from, but it’s a same as cash 90 day kind of thing, not determined by credit, apply and get approved online and no money down unless you want to put some down. We’ve been doing it for years this way. Right around this time too so we don’t pay interest cause I make the biweekly payment and then pay it off out of my tax return."
12,172200514,Janelle Miller,• Aurora,30 Dec,Wow!! What place is that? Have you tried discount tires? Or Firestone?-You can get their credit card and get a discount as well- they charge about $100/tire for a new all weather tire. I have an appointment with Firestone this Friday!
13,172200514,Janelle Miller,• Aurora,30 Dec,Did you try calling Big O Tires too?
14,172200514,Nadine Rains,• Aurora,30 Dec,"I’m heading to big Os now! I called sams and they didn’t have my tires, but big Os does, wild to think I can do two tires there at less than what I was being charged at this tire shop on colfax down the road from me 🤦🏽‍♀️"

9,168467710,Chad Hinshaw,• South Park Hill,21 Nov,"I echo others, PLEASE consider other options like Dumb Friends League or Max Fund before using the Denver Animal Shelter. Denver will not scan for a microchip or attempt to locate owner, but they will give every vaccination under the sun to the dog on arrival regardless of whether it’s needed. This leaves the owners several hundred dollars bill to get their animal back. Given the current situation this can make it very difficult for owners to regain their pet, so if you have another option please consider it."
10,168467710,Sam Christensen,• Northeast Park Hill,21 Nov,"I actually took her to Maxfund for the chip scan first, then held her myself for a few hours waiting for a response.

Maybe her parents left her in the care of someone when they went for the holidays and she escaped, she’s a husky after all but they are probably unaware I’m hoping. I know someone who is a dog rescue person who could help so let us know how to help you you’re an amazing person..."
21,168467710,Blake Lawler,• Elyria Swansea,23 Nov,"I was actually going to say this, the owner may not know. We found a dog and their owner left him with a sitter he also had a microchip. Luckily she called back within an hour and had someone come get him. I wonder if there is a way to see if the address is correct like asking animal control to check the address or something 🤔"
22,168467710,Megan Landry,• North Park Hill,21w,"Sam, you amazing wonderful soul! Thank you for doing everything you could for this sweet baby! If my dog ever got out (god forbid), I would be devastated but I would want her to be found by someone like you! There are MANY wonderful things about Park Hill but the help and love for dogs in the neighborhood is nothing I have ever seen before! It's incredible, I've seen so much goodness and sweetness in this neighborhood and helping dogs!(edited)"
23,168467710,Sam Christensen,• Northeast Park Hill,23 Nov,I haven't even moved in yet!  We just bought a house around 31st and Ash and get possession on the 4th.  We knew/know nothing about the neighborhood but this has been a great experience so far.  We were actually only driving over to check on the roof progress when we came across Eve.  
24,168467710,Megan Landry,• North Park Hill,23 Nov,Sam Christensen  Welcome to the neighborhood! This is the best neighborhood in Denver! I was born and raised in Denver and wouldn’t ever live anywhere else! We are so happy to have you as our neighbor! Please reach out if you need anything at all! We can help with supplies for Eve if need be! I know someone is missing her desperately I have all my fingers and toes crossed we find her owners!

29,168467710,Ann Burke,• South Park Hill,25 Nov,"Hi, Samantha! Red Fern Rescue is low on fosters right now, but the Heads love Huskies. Will reach out to them since you have offered to foster, but they are also needing donations so could not afford to spay and properly vet Eve, as their budget is already allocated on the homeless dogs coming Dec 5th. However, we as neighbors could easily come together to help Eve financially through donating her medical and food needs to a Rescue. That being said, the care and luxurious housing at DSA is top notch. The best place for her to find her family right now is at the Denver Animal Shelter. What day is she listed for adoption? Please feel free to reach out to me."
30,168467710,Charlene Harlow,• North Park Hill,25 Nov,"Douglas County Canine Rescue is an option.  I haven’t been following your posts closely, but I’m surprised to read that that no one has stepped up to claim this husky. If you are willing to foster her even better. I’m sure they would help you ."

We have three of our own all fixed, microchipped, and up to date on shots. I never knew how cat owners could just let their cats run around  until I became a cat owner and realized they do what they want. 🤦‍♀️"
3,168358325,Maria Draco,• Northeast Park Hill,20 Nov,Continue the good work!! TNR is the humane solution to many issues. 🙌  I've had to put my small project on hold until the clinics re-open. It's going to be another horrible kitten season.
4,168358325,Linda Ornelas,• Adams Heights,20 Nov,I have a large colony of feral cats that I feed daily. I use my own money and give them leftovers from my cats and dog along with fresh cat food. I see them out in the cold and it breaks my heart. I see them limping sometimes and am confident that they are all homeless. I don't know what to do? If you find time I could use some help? I would say right now it's about 8 to 10 cats maybe more? You are a wonderful  person to dedicate yourself to this cause! I live in Commerce City off 68th and Clermont street. Please private message me if you are interested? God bless you!
5,168358325,Blake Lawler,• Elyria Swansea,20 Nov,Oh wow bless your heart we did this for some cats when we first moved in 41st and Steele and were able to get traps from Metro Denver Cat. Unfortunately they're the only resource that I know of and they are not doing TNR right now. I know how overwhelming and heartbreaking it can be. I would call them and see what they suggest for the time being and what resources they have they are a wonderful resource. I love donating to them because of the impact on the community they have. It saddens me people get cats and let them outdoors without them being spayed and neutered especially with all of the resources that do it for free or with a small donation because then it ends up being a huge problem with cats that have no homes. 💔😪😭
6,168358325,Nathalie Landeau,• Central Park,20 Nov,Thank you for doing this.  I have done TNR in the past and it is not easy.  You are really helping those feral cats and also helping to prevent more unwanted cats !
7,168358325,Cecilia Allee,• Commerce City,7 Feb,Hi I was wondering if you are able to tell me on how or who I can contact for them to come and get our family of cats that live here in my back yard there are 5 of them 3 of them have been here since being kittens so one of them is most likely the momma. My son makes sure they have food that is why they have stuck around. On one of the younger cats it has recently got sometime of injury to its front right foot or leg we cant get close enough to tell what has happened.  I dont mind if they are brought back just want them to be looked at and possibly fixed so they dont have anymore. Thanks Cecilia

1,153959463,Tom Yohe,• Central Park,6 Jul,The Quality Inn has been converted into a interim stay facility to get people off of the streets and back on their feet.  Stays there are going to be 6 to 12 months.  It is not an overnight shelter for folks still living on the streets.

2,163352696,JA Schmalen,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,3 Oct,"I know weekends are scarce but possibly a call to animal control to help get him off the streets? In the meantime if people would be calm and not chase,may be able to get his attention with aromic food. "
3,163352696,Julie Gaucher,• East Colfax,4 Oct,"I learned my lesson long ago about chasing.  It was in my yard and when I started walking to it, it started walking away.  I will grab treats and call animal control if I see it again.  thanks for those suggestions.  I just assumed its family found it but Emily has seen it around last week so it is probably homeless and abandoned 😭"
4,163352696,Jan Delsi,• East Colfax,3 Oct,This dog lives at 14th and Willow. It had escape twice prior in the past week. The owners are trying to figure it out.  They fixed the fence but not sure of other issues. They are new to the neighbors. Lets hope they get this situation under control.

The BBQ sponsored by the owner was a PR event.  Fortuitously, last Thursday at a community meeting our DPD community officer offered their supply of backpacks to be handed out at the event.

It is wishful thinking; as opposed to biting the bullet of accepting that there simply is no rhyme or reason for the indecision, and such decisions made, by the city, in current times.

8,155657139,Linda P.,• Wellshire East,39w,"Watched the July 20 city council meeting and they go into great detail about why all but one council person decided to support the mall renovation.  They also explain why an editorial in the paper doesn't understand the situation under consideration.    Nothing is being cut by this vote from current school funding.  The 33 mil mentioned wouldn't necessarily go to the schools in any case if cut from the mall project. The state might reduce state funding to the schools if it did.  Without it, the mall renovation would likely be impossible for the next 10-20 years and other funding acquired from fed and other sources would almost certainly have to be returned to those sources and fought for again in years to come after it's already been hard fought & put in place now.  Needs and benefits were discussed.   Replay of the meeting is available through the city council website. It's a long meeting.  I believe discussion of this issue is the last agenda item. It's toward the end at any rate but it is a fairly long though interesting discussion.  Fast forward is available.  After listening, Denver Council's decision made a lot of sense to me.(edited)"
9,155657139,John Franquemont,• Capitol Hill NW,23 Jul,"This project has been in the works for a long time. Infrastructure projects like this have a lot of moving parts and once they’re in motion, it’s difficult to just stop them due to a recent event (covid-19). These improvements have been warranted for awhile now and once completed, this could very well change the dynamic of the mall and Lodo. With the mall being more pedestrian and restaurant friendly, more people will be attracted to come and check it out. Not to mention, they’re adding more mature foliage and green space, which is always a worth-while improvement."

0,155678844,Gaar Potter,• Happy Canyon,22 Jul,I just go look at the Capitol Building and Civic Center Park for my inspiration. GOOD JOB DENVER!
1,155678844,Ralph C.,• North Park Hill,22 Jul,Perhaps those of us with classic cars could expand the parade participants?
2,155678844,Gaar Potter,• Happy Canyon,22 Jul,Looks like they want us to stay home:
3,155678844,Scott J.,• Hampden East,22 Jul,Dont forget to wear yr mask and step around the homeless tents on the sidewalk. 🤫
4,155678844,Shirley Tracey,• Windsor North,22 Jul,Perhaps those of us with AK47s could get a parade spot??? Just kidding. :-)
5,155678844,Shirley Tracey,• Windsor North,22 Jul,"No it was just a joke.  I don't want to shoot anyone.  Several people on this website have been discussing buying guns for protection because we have so much crime in the neighborhood lately.  Sorry, I should have realized someone would think I was serious.  Just a stupid joke. No worries."
6,155678844,Heather Side,• Holly Hills/Holly Ridge,22 Jul,A parade for all of the businesses lost? The people being evicted soon or the ones foreclosing on their homes? Or maybe it’s for the record unemployment in the state- will the roly poly Governor be there? Is it a parade for the record number of suicides in the state for the last 3 months? Or it must be for all the lonely people who can’t get together to worship. Just wondering WTF you think there is to celebrate?
7,155678844,Jeremy G.,• Baker,22 Jul,"Suicides are down in CO, not up."
8,155678844,Shirley Tracey,• Windsor North,22 Jul,"People are allowed to gather for BLM peaceful demonstrations, and to gather for defund police violent destruction, and gather in Civic Center Park to live in tents and party-on.  Freedom of speech only applies to some, they have privilege.  The rest of us just work to clean up the mess left behind."
9,155678844,Mary Jermance,• Fort Logan,22 Jul,"After watching how people rallying in support of law enforcement in downtown Denver this past Sunday got attacked and beat up by hordes of ""Antifa"" thugs, and the Denver Police did nothing per instructions from above, think I'll pass, thanks all the same. I'll just stay home and ""re-imagine"" Denver as the really nice city it once was a very long time ago."
10,155678844,Shirley Tracey,• Windsor North,22 Jul,Amen Mary!  Yes.  I too remember.  The violence in every city is horrible.
11,155678844,Jeffrey Sturman,• CBD,23 Jul,In reality crime is at historic lows across the nation! Don't watch the lies at the pres rallies.
12,155678844,Andrew Rothman,• Beeler Park,22 Jul,Just turn off fox news and it all goes away...like a miracle.
13,155678844,KR C.,• Mar Lee,23 Jul,Really?  I though MSM wanted it to all go away....
14,155678844,Shirley Tracey,• Windsor North,23 Jul,What is MSM?  I like to know what is happening so I read and watch and listen to a variety of perspectives.  Fox shows video you won't see and interviews you won't hear anywhere else.  I wonder why?
15,155678844,KR C.,• Mar Lee,23 Jul,Mainstream media.  I have heard them minimize the riots frequently or not report on them at all.  Very few if at all reported on the riot Sunday at Civic Center Park attacking the pro police PEACEFUL protestors.  Some barely got away with their lives.
16,155678844,KR C.,• Mar Lee,23 Jul,"My hope is that the leaders in power will have the Capitol building cleaned and repaired as well as the buildings and businesses surrounding it.  Take care of the crime and hope that we can come to better and more positive solutions rather than what is going on in our city currently.  A neighborhood parade is nice, but there are bigger issues to solve and hope that there can be unity with various positive solutions."
17,155678844,Shirley Tracey,• Windsor North,23 Jul,When people  continue destroying property and attacking people who is going to come together with positive solutions and unity.  I am more realistic than that.  The longer this rioting goes on the more I am disliking this movement.  The value of the original mission has been lost.  Now it is just evil.
18,155678844,Dee S.,• Five Points,23 Jul,Perhaps the parade can showcase the location selected by each city council member for the homeless encampment in their District as requested by the mayor.
19,155678844,Shirley Tracey,• Windsor North,23 Jul,That is hilarious Dave.
20,155678844,Digital Marketing Strategist Kersten Arnold,• City of Denver,24 Jul,"This thread is now off-topic and has been closed.

4,156274774,Gaar Potter,• Happy Canyon,37w,John B. Not really. Their boots (jack) sound like they hit the ground pretty much in unison...(edited)
5,156274774,Victoria Herne,• Northeast Park Hill,30 Jul,We voted on allowing camping and the vote was no.  Now he wants to turn the Denver Coliseum parking lot into an encampment.  He needs to respect the voters.  The executive branch is supposed to enforce the laws not ignore them.
6,156274774,John Beldock,• RiNo Art District,31 Jul,The mayor is being undermined by city council.
7,156274774,Sally G.,• College View / South Platte,31 Jul,I agree with all of you!
8,156274774,LAWRENCE WILSON,• Northeast Park Hill,31 Jul,For those of us willing we should try to talk to our mayor before making post of political statements. Voice your opinion in person with an open mind.
9,156274774,LAWRENCE WILSON,• Northeast Park Hill,1 Aug,This hole segment reminds me of a lynch mod that hanged a black man 5 yrs ago....  same mentality
10,156274774,Gaar Potter,• Happy Canyon,2 Aug,I missed that whole lynching! Do you have a link so I can educate myself?
11,156274774,Karen T.,• Indian Creek,3 Aug,Not a Hancock fan myself particularly since the Canadian geese slaughter and sacrificing view and open space for the highest  bids but-This has nothing to do with skin color! Way to incite agitation!
12,156274774,Peter F.,• Eastmoor Park,2 Aug,People I am a huge conservative! We need to consider all people during this time of crisis. Homeless People need a safe haven were they can stay distanced and reasonable safe. We need to address the Homeless crisis but this is not the time to get confrontational about the encampment.
13,156274774,LAWRENCE WILSON,• Northeast Park Hill,4 Aug,I agree there are lot of homeless people trying to work and fight the system we created so that they cannot afford homes ( remember people it was not that long ago a 1bedroom apartment was only 650 and within three years it was over 1000 and that’s we we started having homeless issues in this state ... now it’s about 1500 a moth for a one bedroom apartment and McDonald’s doesn’t pay that much to its managers let alone those trying to make ends meet on what we pay them.. so think wouldn’t you want your child to thrive or just survive in our state..  for they are just one step away from being homeless themselves!!
14,156274774,Val B.,• Harvey Park,26 Aug,Wasn’t because of the legalization of marijuana that attracted all kind of people here ?
15,156274774,Reeves B.,• Harvey Park,28 Aug,I never participate in online chats about public policy because my observation has been that such chats are usually driven by emotions and competing political ideologies with very limited awareness of the facts ...but I just CAN'T resist weighing in on this homeless discussion.
0,174010975,Sherry Liberato,• 92nd and Grove,16 Jan,What kinds of things?
1,174010975,Sarah Sheehan,• Holly Hills,16 Jan,I am currently working with two families that have very little.  I am happy to share more details about these families privately but here are the basics: 
2,174010975,Carol Giambri,• Church Ranch Blvd,17 Jan,How kind of you to help families. Have you checked craigslist for free items? Furniture should be easy finding and free.
3,174010975,Mariee Santistevan,• Sunnyside,17 Jan,I recently worked with a Community resource navigator through Denver Health & I didn't know they reach out for items through Nextdoor?
4,174010975,Sarah Sheehan,• Holly Hills,17 Jan,I hope your experience with Denver Health was positive. I can’t speak to how Denver Health works specifically but I imagine you are correct about them not reaching out for things on Craigslist and Nextdoor.

0,156455930,Maria A. Garcia,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,30 Jul,There was a camper on fire but thats all i saw....also noticed that Spencer park is becoming a homeless camp park
1,156455930,Julie Elliott,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,3 Aug,I noticed that as well. It doesn’t seem to keep people from enjoying the playground though. Thanks for letting me know about the camper. It was about a block west of the park and I couldn’t see what was going on down there while on my way home from the store. Thank you for the info.
0,154677621,Patty Blevins,• Mayfair,13 Jul,So sad. 😪
1,154677621,Anna McCaffery,• Congress Park,13 Jul,It would be great to turn it into low-income housing.
2,154677621,Richard Boehm,• South Park Hill,13 Jul,The cost would be prohibitive. It would also depreciate all the properties in the area. Personally I think it would be a poor idea.
3,154677621,ELAINE MARTIN,• South Park Hill,13 Jul,Richard Boehm 👍
4,154677621,Mark Stenstrom,• South Park Hill,13 Jul,The main Treat Hall is a national registered landmark so it won't be taken down thankfully.

6,154677621,Richard Boehm,• South Park Hill,13 Jul,As long as you live far enough away it does not depreciate your homes value.
7,154677621,Ben Miller,• Central Park,14 Jul,Richard Boehm yup
8,154677621,David Akerson,• South Park Hill,14 Jul,"Richard Boehm, I live 1/2 block away.  Johnson and Wales would have indoor apartments for every person, no tents or outdoor sleeping.  There are cafeterias, classrooms, shower and bathrooms, theatres.  Great for the city of Denver, a fantastic solution for our homeless issue"
9,154677621,Richard Boehm,• South Park Hill,15 Jul,What I find interesting is your profile says you live on Glencoe a mile away and not a half block
10,154677621,David Akerson,• South Park Hill,15 Jul,An old profile that I haven't updated.  I live on Olive St. now in the 1700 block.
11,154677621,Donna Burrell,• South Park Hill,14 Jul,Are there any thoughts about the property being declared a historical landmark? I have lived a block away for 40+ tears and there's so much history to protect.
12,154677621,David Akerson,• South Park Hill,14 Jul,See above Donna.  Apparently Treat Hall already is.  As for the rest of the campus....?
13,154677621,Gami Mattson,• East Colfax,16 Jul,"Donna, I totally agree with you. I grew up 60+ years with it being Colorado Women’s College. It has a wonderful history."
14,154677621,Keegan Perkins,• Central Park,14 Jul,Affordable housing in those dorms would be helpful. I think it’s too early to know what will happen.
15,154677621,Kat Aguilar,• South Park Hill,15 Jul,Maybe a community center for actual parkhill ?
16,154677621,Richard Boehm,• South Park Hill,17 Jul,As I was driving down Colorado Blvd I noticed that there are a couple of abandoned hotel. Also some of the hotels on Colfax. Should be cheap to remodel and use for homeless shelters
17,154677621,Anna McCaffery,• Congress Park,40w,"Sadly Richard those hotels are being sold to developers who are planning to build 12-story market-value apt buildings with no parking, which will be a new ring of hell to deal with. The neighbors are fighting it.  You are right about them being perfect for low-income housing though. There is no real long term plan to abate the homeless problem in the city.(edited)"

1,159002177,Heather Smith-Hillman,• South Park Hill,34w,"I couldn’t comment on the previous post as the ability to do so was shut down, perhaps by Nextdoor?  I was not surprised by this at all.  My husband and I worked with her when we sold our home in Hilltop in 2013 and she was totally unprofessional in every way.  I walked away from the entire experience feeling like we had just dealt with a very evil person. I always thought that at some point, karma would come back to haunt her, never imagining that it would involve theft and racism.(edited)"
2,159002177,Justin Retzlaff,• Historic Montclair,34w,"Such a vile, ignorant person.  So disillusioned.  Has no idea that vilifying black lives matter and the homeless or mentally ill, IS the very America-hating that she wishes “people” would stop.  She has so much disgust for what happens to actually be people exactly like herself.(edited)"
3,159002177,Keegan Perkins,• Central Park,23 Aug,"I strive to move to understanding, compassion, and forgiveness. I don’t see that she did anything that can’t lead to those. She certainly isn’t single handedly responsible for disparities in housing and income. Sounds like she stole some signs. I can’t speak to what else. But if she makes amends, we should go forward. People make mistakes."
4,159002177,Justin Retzlaff,• Historic Montclair,34w,"If she showed any remorse or leaning towards that direction, I’d agree.  But she continually defends her ignorant positions of BLM and the homeless being “what’s wrong with Denver/America”.  I would gladly give credit to anyone ATTEMPTING to be a better person, which to date, she has not.(edited)"
5,159002177,Billy Rediess,• Lowry,23 Aug,"Haven't we all seen this sort of dark side for years, however recently it is has become perfectly acceptable in society.  I wish her heart was different, but it's just not. We are who we are. I ask though for each of us, how can we be  better neighbors to one another, including those who don't have our hearts?"
6,159002177,cylie babcock,• Mayfair,23 Aug,"You, sir, are a true gentleman. Maybe, we should all wish her a change of heart, not for her but as kind people we should want people to be their best."

8,159002177,Dave Coldiron,• North Park Hill,23 Aug,I trust someone will be filing a complaint with the Real Estate Commission.  This kind of behavior makes all Realtors look bad and they should tolerate this criminality.
9,159002177,Mark Yaw,• Mayfair,34w,"The one thing that mental health, education, law enforcement, and spiritual professionals will tell you with 100% certainty -- people with antisocial personalities never change. Because they can't. And so these individuals end up all alone, because people afflicted with compassion and empathy can't change, either.(edited)"
10,159002177,Anna Noble,• Central Park,23 Aug,What’s scary is she was doing stuff like this for over 40 years before someone finally held her accountable.

12,159002177,Maren Jorgensen,• Mayfair,23 Aug,Thanks for sharing Millete. Well said! We have to hold people accountable for their racism and bigotry!
13,159002177,Kiran Majid,• North Park Hill,23 Aug,Thank you for sharing.
14,159002177,marcia jones,• Mayfair,23 Aug,Perhaps this relator - and other relators - should consider the fact that the neighborhood they're trying to protect doesn't need or want protecting.  Relators don't know the lives and opinions (except the posting of signs) of every resident.
15,159002177,Greg Petty,• Hilltop,23 Aug,"I  certainly agree with the Millete's post.  the upsetting thing to me is how widespread views like hers are.  Until the past 4 years I had no idea how deep the resentment and racial bias was among so many whites.  I'd like to believe that if we change Presidents, we can start to have some reconciliation in the country that will lessen the bigotry and anger, especially of people on the far right."
16,159002177,Cristin Cochran,• Hilltop,23 Aug,"I missed the earlier messaging on NextDoor but, per the Denver Post, it was that sharing that led to her termination.  I am proud to be part of this neighborhood that saw something wrong and did something about it.  Driving along Dahlia Street today from Alameda to 6th Avenue happy to see lots of BLM signs.  Also driving home from dinner last night past a homemade BLM sign on Monaco; my husband joked that the homeowner had to make his own sign out of steel and lumber to keep Denise from toting it off!"
17,159002177,John Bitzanakis,• Historic Montclair,23 Aug,"I totally agree what she did was wrong, but I don’t see one comment about the RIOTS downtown last night!!  I guess not important"
18,159002177,Tracy Shaffer,• North Park Hill,23 Aug,"Ms. Reich's actions not only disgrace the profession, they are illegal. Not only trespassing, theft, and tampering, there are also Fair Housing Laws and numerous ethical violations from National Association of Realtors. Her views, in my opinion, are abhorrent and I hope she is held accountable for her actions. She does not need my forgiveness, she needs counseling."
19,159002177,Deborah Stough,• South Park Hill,24 Aug,I wonder if the real estate commision is looking into this?
20,159002177,Michele McManus,• South Park Hill,34w,"It has been over 20 years since I left that Re/Max office and the profession. However, I can tell you Denice Reich does not restrict her dislike to People of Color alone. Much like trump she had a reputation of screwing over fellow Realtors to get the sale. She was dishonest, mean, phony and only out for herself. I can attest to this not just by reputation but by personal experience. IMO she should lose her license. Otherwise, my guess is she will just open her own office. She is a cancer on the real estate industry and the community.(edited)"

22,159002177,Michele McManus,• South Park Hill,23 Aug,"""the signs were as offensive as 'KKK' signs,"" and insisted she returned them a few hours later. She also called Black Lives Matter ""a 'terrorist organization' out to destroy America."" - Denice Reich, DENVER7"

26,159002177,Karen Ashmore,• North Park Hill,23 Aug,"Thank God we have realtors like you, Millete! I hope everyone who read your post calls you when they are ready to buy or sell a property. And refer other buyers/sellers to you. I know I will."
27,159002177,Jane Skarka,• Mayfair,23 Aug,"I second that, Karen!"
28,159002177,John Bitzanakis,• Historic Montclair,23 Aug,I guess a stupid theft is more important then all the damage done to private and city property in downtown last night!!!  Let us keep quit like all the other cities
29,159002177,Dave Coldiron,• North Park Hill,23 Aug,calling out Reich's deplorable behavior doesn't justify the criminal behavior downtown.  We can condemn both.

I lived on Curtis Street across from the homeless shelter on 23rd & Curtis and yes, my car got broken into once, there was always trash around, and the alley always smelled like urine, BUT... I never looked at it being their fault. It is not their fault they are homeless. It is not their fault that they can’t get into a shelter because it’s safer on the streets than in a shelter. I met some very nice homeless individuals and ALL of them were trying to look for a job, but their interviews were far south in Englewood or Lakewood. They had no way to get to work even if they got the job. So please, stop complaining so much and be grateful that you are not homeless during a time like this."

Personally I posted a couple of months back creating free camping grounds with toilets, water, showers and trash disposal. They don’t have to be in city proper. They could be relocated to these site and with free camping this would allow banning camping on sidewalks, parks, easements and along  roadways. This would allow social efforts to be concentrated to those areas and policed. I empathize but creating unsanitary, unstructured, health issues and potentially criminal sites is not an answer."

0,173867862,Robert Terrell,• Northeast Park Hill,15 Jan,As many issues as you guys in that area are having I would invest in a security camera system. There are some relatively inexpensive systems out there. We moved from your area to Englewood and have cameras all around our home. The thugs are realizing this and have gradually started to stay away. Our videos turned over to the police have resulted in three arrests.
1,173867862,Jim Winski,• Central Park,15 Jan,"In this particular block, the houses do not necessarily face the street. There are 3 single family home courtyards on the south side of the street, so only about 5 houses have a side yard that faces 29th Pl. On the north side of the street are a few sets of condos & townhomes and only a handful of those have a direct view of the street. We'd need to get cooperation from those few houses/condos that do face the street to set up cameras."
2,173867862,Anna Bellatorre,• Central Park,15 Jan,"Yes, that is our situation. We do not face the street, so any cameras attached to our house or doorbell would not help with street crime. We did reach out to our neighbors with corner units to see if they had anything."

I’m moving out the 23rd though, and will have multiple large shampoo/conditioners just going to waste (opened, but can easily wipe down the outside and the inside is of course clean). I’ll also have numerous pantry items (some canned, some opened and therefore can’t be donated to a food bank but again perfectly good) that I would be happy to donate?"

3,161785478,Pam Becker,• Hampden Heights East,19 Sep,"I wonder how many would go if they actually set these up?  Many of the homeless deal with mental illness and one of their big fears is people controlling them.  I just wonder “if they build them they will come?” My husband works with the mentally ill and used to help get them off the street and into housing.  Many times he would go and check on them and their apartments were empty and they were living on the streets not in it.  Their fears kept them from living in a “safe” place.  I’m sure some would, but without the mental health being worked on, it may be hard for others.  I don’t have the answers, I wish I did.  Just wondering out loud."

2,167881678,Christa Osman,• Central Park,14 Nov,Yeah...they obviously don't give a sh**...and need to be reminded why protocols are in place. I would say report it to the appropriate agency.
3,167881678,Jodie Alexander,• Hoffman Heights,15 Nov,Agree with Aman... email and call corporate. I did the same with another 7-11 ... I had a terrible experience and was told by a member of staff that they ‘weren’t sweating it so I shouldn’t either’ regarding masks and Covid.

5,167881678,Karen Urwin,• Northeast Park Hill,15 Nov,If you contact 311 they will take a report and pay a visit to the store.
6,167881678,Carleigh Combs,• East Colfax,15 Nov,It's not just this location. I've been to multiple 711 locations all around Denver metro and between customers and employees there's always at least 1 person without a mask. And I'm not sure I've even seen hand sanitizer dispensers at any of the locations I've been to over the last few months. I know for a fact the one across from where I live does not have any. Are they supposed to?? I haven't stayed up to date with recommendations/ requirements since prior to summer  so I have no idea what businesses are supposed to be doing lol.
7,167881678,David Navarro,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,15 Nov,"Everywhere it seems people are wearing their mask under their nose if thats if their even wearing it at all. Walmart on Quebec, Walmart grocery on Havana and Colfax especially. Very SCARY times we live in."
8,167881678,Jean Tilley,• Tava Waters,15 Nov,Yea I've pretty much stopped going into stores because of employees and customers wearing their masks below their noses- which actually produces smaller droplets than your mouth! The anti maskers should take some of the blame for the poor economy by scaring customers away. I spend way more in person than when shopping online.

14,167881678,Lyndsey H.,• Parkfield,15 Nov,"April H. How? She’s specifically saying she is high risk and doesn’t like how a store is handling the pandemic. Just my opinion but my sister, who is high risk, hasn’t left her house since March. So if you feel unsafe, stay in."
15,167881678,Christa Osman,• Central Park,15 Nov,"It's more than just high risk people feeling unsafe. Why is this concept so difficult?  This is public health safety. Nothing about these regulations are difficult to uphold. Sanitizer? Plexi glass?  Masks? These are simple protocols.  Not hard. Why should anyone feel like businesses are disregarding simple protocols because they are lazy and disrespectful? Nope. Not acceptable.  This isn't acceptable for any other safety regulation put into place, and this situation is no different."
16,167881678,Juanita Villa,• Green Valley Ranch,15 Nov,You don't have to be high risk. My brother who just turned 47  passed away just a week ago. His coworker had covid and refused to tell anyone at his job and unfortunately my brother got it and passed away. It's not a joke!
17,167881678,Lyndsey H.,• Parkfield,15 Nov,"That’s really awful about your brother. My grandmother, who is 89, got it and got over it within 10 days. Didn’t even have to go to the hospital, just went to her PCP."
18,167881678,Juanita Villa,• Green Valley Ranch,15 Nov,It is Lyndsy. He went to his pop as well and was sent home to quarantine. A few days later he was gasping for air and when his wife called the ambulance it was to late. His lungs failed and than his heart.

Keep viligent of yourselves and your neighbors, keep a loaded gun handy and ready to protect your family because sometimes the police will not be there to defend you. (I've seen it take up to 50+ min for the police to respond when it's serious, no fault of the police, they just have alot to do in this area.) This area used to be 100x worse from today for sure"
9,161329833,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,14 Sep,"I agree about being prepared to defend yourself. Things can happen in a quarter of a second. No police, no matter how diligent, can ever be on site  quick enough to respond to that."

16,161329833,Kirk Wayland,• Mayfair,14 Sep,Colfax is a never-ending circus train. It's edgy and sometimes sketchy but I'll take it over some whitewashed strip mall in suburbia. The crime statistics along Colfax are fairly typical of any major transit artery in a metropolitan area. Just keep your wits about you and cultivate some street smarts in those kids.

How can peoples lives be safe on all levels while acknowledging privilege and the real fear that comes with the frequency of gun shots .

30,161329833,Jennifer Ward,• East Colfax,14 Sep,"To be honest this was an impulse post and I don't regularly get on Nextdoor until the last week or so.  I am aware there is an East Colfax neighborhood association and I certainly plan to get more involved and was hoping to hear from them on this thread.  I also have not yet contacted our councilwoman as I was hoping to find others who feel the same way and approach as a group, since there is generally more power in numbers.  My main goal from this post was to find some hope that maybe something can be done, even if it only makes a tiny difference.  And I personally have no intentions on moving, as l still love my neighborhood and we personally have not felt threatened."

3,158777140,Mary Flower,• East Washington Virginia Vale,22 Aug,Sounds like staying at home has gotten to him. Sounds more like a mental health issue to me (maybe his dog died and he's just mad at the world.. js)
4,158777140,Jane Salland,• Lowry,21 Aug,"I am not sure if it is the same man but there is a man who curses, spits and points at us like he is holding a gun when we walk our dog. We have called the cops but they said there is nothing we can do. He scares us. He is thin, Caucasian with black greying short hair."
5,158777140,David Aba,• Lowry,21 Aug,"He did not threaten me or point at me like he was holding a weapon, but, this does sound like the same person based on your description and experience."
6,158777140,Angela Krauss,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,21 Aug,Let the police and apartment manager know about this. Isabella Thalles died because of an incident that started out this way.😪
7,158777140,Melody Hodges,• East Colfax,21 Aug,That's why I'm surprised the cops said there was nothing they could do.... My impression from the news stories was this was exactly how the incident that resulted in Isabella Thalles death began.  Maybe talk to an attorney?  Perhaps he needs a mental health intervention.
8,158777140,Susan Puccio,• Central Park,21 Aug,"Melody Hodges he hasn’t broken any laws ( if he threatens or assaults ahuman the police could do something). this is why people are asking for mental health folks to work with the police dept.  police are not trained to assess, mental health is! so don’t say “ defund the police- say “ Add/ support “ support the PD with mental health!"
9,158777140,Cathy Bann,• South Hilltop,21 Aug,Just report him to the police and have them talk to him so crazy that people are going nuts
10,158777140,Jane Salland,• Lowry,35w,"The cops told me to call them so they could have a conversation with him and in addition to the cop that came out, the community resource officer called me to talk about it. But the cops never have come in time to see him.(edited)"
11,158777140,David Aba,• Lowry,21 Aug,Thanks for the thoughtful comments. My wife and I will see what we can do with building management for that condo complex. If it happens again I’ll record the experience with my phone - then call the police.
12,158777140,Debbi GreerEdick,• Congress Park,21 Aug,"People like this can be very mean.  Please watch your pup carefully, if you live close to this person."
13,158777140,Jane Salland,• Lowry,21 Aug,"Yes, he told us he could break our dog's neck"
14,158777140,Bill Horowitz,• East Colfax,21 Aug,Call police last guy did that (business owner lived downtown) ended up pulling a weapon on innocent people walking dogs .It's not your lawn anyway. And if it's HOA even more reason to stfu! But just writing.
15,158777140,Sharon Berthrong,• Lowry,21 Aug,i always pretend I am hard of hearing and ignore the idiot.
16,158777140,Susan Puccio,• Central Park,21 Aug,i think the more calls ( to get concerns documented) would help in getting help for this man plus protection for others.
17,158777140,Susan Puccio,• Central Park,21 Aug,"there used to be a man who walked sand creek trail who was very afraid of dogs( many dog walkers on this trail) and would yell and pull out his phone and pretend? to call the cops on us.  i could tell he was afraid but he was pretty scary too. often, people hide their fear with anger. Haven’t seen him for over a year now but he was scary."
18,158777140,Donna Regan,• Washington Virginia Vale,21 Aug,"If the man is mentally ill, why call the police. If they did arrest him they would take him to Denver Health for an evaluation and soon be released. NO ONE can force him to take meds. Be thankful your not one of his neighbors."
19,158777140,Jan H.,• Lowry,21 Aug,"The fact that he is behaving this way, does not mean that he has a severe mental illness nor does it mean that he cannot be helped by a therapist or other support services without medications. It does not even imply what kind of mental health diagnosis, he has, if any."
20,158777140,Donna Regan,• Washington Virginia Vale,22 Aug,Jan Holland-Beachley I should not have assumed. I’ve been involved with homeless men for 17 years. Of course there are resources out there to numerous to mention here. The bottom line is he’s in control weather he chooses to seek or reach out for help.
21,158777140,Deb Montour,• Washington Virginia Vale,21 Aug,"Time for the peace force, i guess. I hope he has been reported"
22,158777140,Kimberley Galbraith,• East Washington Virginia Vale,21 Aug,Don't respond...he may have some level of mental illness.  Just leave him alone and think nothing of it! 😀
23,158777140,Avi Ancel,• East Washington Virginia Vale,21 Aug,The man is obviously mentally ill. I strongly suggest you call the police - and the sooner the better. Remember that man down town denver that shot the couple and killed the woman a month ago? Call the police please. Avi
24,158777140,Nadia Garcia,• Del Mar Parkway,21 Aug,"Be careful with crazy people like that, remember what happened not to long ago downtown to the couple that were walking their dog 😔 Hope the cops do something about that"
25,158777140,Bell Sands,• Del Mar Parkway,21 Aug,Yikes!  True.
26,158777140,IsaacRay Gomez,• Del Mar Parkway,21 Aug,"He tried gettin slick with me once! Yelling all kinds of profanities at me an my dogs. I told him to come down to say it up close to my face, he just muttered something about police."
27,158777140,Avi Ancel,• East Washington Virginia Vale,21 Aug,Why didn't you call the police?
28,158777140,Jim Askins,• Tava Waters,21 Aug,Tell the police he's not wearing pants and yelling profane things at you.
29,158777140,Mary Flower,• East Washington Virginia Vale,22 Aug,Don't lie to the police!
30,158777140,Jim Askins,• Tava Waters,22 Aug,Mary Flower relax. It's sarcasm. Life might be a lot more enjoyable if you lighten up. Seems to be a common theme on ND.
31,158777140,Bell Sands,• Del Mar Parkway,21 Aug,Top notch weirdo. 🙄

15,151509337,Jamie Tenace Tenace,• Lowry,14 Jun,Gemma hi.  Well I thought I had it figured out but I still don’t   This lady lives right around Bible Park and yes trying to find someone who could go pick them up and take either Second Chance or somewhere good to donate   She just has no idea what to do and is not mobile   Someone said just call Vietnam Vets and they will pick up   What do you think ?
16,151509337,Gemma Wilkinson,• Woodside Village,14 Jun,"I just sent you a private message, Jamie. I'm confident we can figure this out."
17,151509337,Barbara Zimmerman,• East Washington Virginia Vale,15 Jun,We donated clothes to ARC.

0,167667986,Crystal Swords,• Hoffman Heights,12 Nov,I actually just saw him a few days ago to talk about doing some work on my house.  I have his phone number if you need it.  He seemed like a super nice guy. ☹️
1,167667986,Darin Wentz,• Hoffman Heights,12 Nov,Yeah he does seem like a really nice guy I have his phone number thank you though
2,167667986,Kathy Davinci,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,12 Nov,Why don't you direct message him and deal with him privately?

3,158794076,Nate Hull,• Skyland,21 Aug,what kind of drugs have you gotten from them so far?
4,158794076,Jenny Curtis,• Clayton,22 Aug,Dude are you actually saying can't spot a drug deal🤔
5,158794076,Barbara D.,• Central Park,21 Aug,Is that your lawn or an easement?  Wouldn't that be trespassing?
6,158794076,Liz LaRue,• Northeast Park Hill,21 Aug,The police had them move the bikes and suitcases off our fence line and that was that
7,158794076,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,21 Aug,"If you suspect illegal activity,  why don’t you call 311 and have it investigated?  Maybe if they knew they were being watched then they might leave. Or at least stop.  Where do you live?"
8,158794076,Liz LaRue,• Northeast Park Hill,21 Aug,Yes Kristen I have already gone the 311 and 911 route. For a week they show up and nothing gets done. I didn’t just hop on ND and state this without contacting authorities.
9,158794076,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,21 Aug,I’m sure you didn’t.  Feel for you!
10,158794076,Karin Schumacher,• South Park Hill,21 Aug,"PLEASE contact Chris Herndon, City Councilperson for help.  This situation is unexplainable and unacceptable. What are the cops telling you?  If necessary, contact one of the news stations to come and take photos and put it on the news.  I bet lots of people are looking for their stolen items. (Why can't the police match the bikes to the IDs that folks have registered as stolen?) Further the police can set up a watch/surveillance to see if/when drug deals are going down."
11,158794076,Liz LaRue,• Northeast Park Hill,21 Aug,"The police quite literally never even looked through the pickup. There were a good 10 bikes in it and they didn’t even question it. There were about 20 bikes on the sidewalk. Police have yet to follow up with me. I call, make the report, request a follow up and then nothing. I’m basically screaming into the void"
12,158794076,Liz LaRue,• Northeast Park Hill,35w,My neighbor caught the “residents” selling used needles under the tree at the end of her driveway and this morning the “camp” has been straightened up however the actual camper is still there. We haven’t heard any updates. I want everyone to be aware of a conversation I did have with a PO late yesterday. 
13,158794076,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,22 Aug,Try to reach out to ND post from the Hari Krishna post they had their bicycles stolen right in front of them from a stolen car.
0,158985611,Chris Barnett,• East Colfax,22 Aug,Why were the cops called?
1,158985611,Frank Barnhart,• Aurora,23 Aug,No clue. The lady that was next to me at the light was talking on the phone with them.
2,158985611,Jay Yoakam,• Aurora,23 Aug,Only 3 Caucasian allowed or they are considered a gang.
3,158985611,Brian Plummer,• Central Park,23 Aug,Naaa that’s called a entitlement
4,158985611,Thump Johnson,• East Colfax,23 Aug,Lmao
5,158985611,Charras Scott,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Aug,Oh hell your on here
6,158985611,Nicole Ryan,• East Colfax,23 Aug,Why did someone waste their time calling the cops
7,158985611,Frank Barnhart,• Aurora,23 Aug,Who knows. Maybe the lady who called it in was having a bad day.
8,158985611,Abeth Parisian,• East Colfax,23 Aug,Maybe it was her golf cart😉
9,158985611,Mitchell Eisenberg,• Aurora,23 Aug,I have been seeing an increase in golf carts recently...did something change that more people bought them?
10,158985611,Frank Barnhart,• Aurora,23 Aug,Its probably the golf cart parked behind noodles and company dumpsters
11,158985611,Brian Plummer,• Central Park,23 Aug,They were at Starbucks in a no parking zone around 1130. I’ve seen them blow through stop signs on 29th more than once. Last week there were 7 of them in the cart with two of them standing on the back bumper.
12,158985611,Bryan VZ,• Central Park,23 Aug,"Plus they are underage,  too many for the amount of seats, not wearing seatbelts,  disregarding the rules of the road, and are usually drinking alcohol while driving."
13,158985611,Dwight Thompson,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Aug,What they are doing is illegal. They need to be fined and the parents reprimanded
14,158985611,Scott Carlson,• Central Park,23 Aug,"I don’t think you need an actual license for one of these do you?  Personally, I would treat it like kids on bikes riding in the streets - Those also blow through stop signs and disobey laws all the time.  If the kids get hurt then it is their issue to deal with - but if they aren’t hurting you perhaps the “nanny state” should let them be???"
15,158985611,Chris Barnett,• East Colfax,23 Aug,Didn’t realize the number of Karens that lived here
16,158985611,Chris Barnett,• East Colfax,23 Aug,I’m sure you all did some kinda hoodrat stuff as a teenager and if you didn’t then I really don’t trust your mayonnaise judgment anyway.
17,158985611,Charlie Gaare,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Aug,"Man, I hope they called in SWAT for this national emergency."
18,158985611,Corey Hopes,• Central Park,23 Aug,"Defund the police, send a social worker"
19,158985611,Dwight Thompson,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Aug,"I did stupid stuff as a kid. I got caught and faced the consequences. It's part of growing up. I nearly hit then the other day while they blew a red light. And using ""Karen"" in this instance shows how little you understand about that term and why it was created. If this was black kids, they'd already be in jail. And yeah, the so-called ""nanny"" state needs to get involved because sooner rather than later, they are going to cause real damage. And to answer even more of your uneducated questioning: YES, IT IS ILLEGAL TO DRIVE A MOTORIZED VEHICLE WITHOUT A LICENSE."
20,158985611,Scott Carlson,• Central Park,23 Aug,That you for liberating me from uneducatedness.  So I guess my kid’s battery operated skateboard is illegal then too by that bolded definition.  And the electric car for 6+ year kids right?

22,158985611,Chez Dyas,• Bluff Lake,34w,So... Are you good with golf carts as long as they meet all the Low Speed Vehicle requirements and follow all street sign and other driving law?(edited)
23,158985611,Dwight Thompson,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Aug,"Absolutely. In this case, following  the law would keep them from a bad accident. Plus, having to go through getting a driver's license will reach them some much needed ethics in driving in public."
24,158985611,John Dahmer,• Central Park,23 Aug,"Holy $hit, the cops we’re called on 4 little girls in a golf cart? I see those girls all the time and they are never a bother nor is it any reason to call the police. People are pathetic. Truly pathetic."
25,158985611,Dwight Thompson,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Aug,"You've been lucky. I didn't call the cops when I nearly hit them, but they nearly died when they ran that light in my instance. I've seen multiple threads on here about them nearly getting hit. If they had a license and followed the law, I'd see no problem, but clearly they are not."
26,158985611,Ellie Carringan,• Central Park,23 Aug,"none of them are even close to 16 from what i have seen. they are clearly not supposed to be driving, especially in a vehicle not made for streets"
27,158985611,Chez Dyas,• Bluff Lake,23 Aug,"Anyone checked their age and if the golf cart is street legal? Or are we just assuming things here? There are such things as street legal golf carts. If the driver has a license too, then this may all just be one big misunderstanding."
28,158985611,Corey Hopes,• Central Park,23 Aug,Cops were called.. and rant was made online the next day. (I have nothing better to do)

I'm to the point now I take her with me everywhere because I can't leave her alone at home unless I lock her in the bathroom which I have had to do.
7,168215855,Melody Hodges,• East Colfax,18 Nov,"I had a Houdina once.... I never could figure out how she got out of the yard.  She also managed to get out of her collars (plural) so I got her a harness but she got out of that, too.  I still haven't found them, and it's been years.  I can't figure out what she did with them.  She was the sweetest dog but she gave me more grief than any other dog I've ever had."

When he reached us he just stared at my dogs. They're small dogs between 11 and 19 lbs. He finally looked up and asked me if I would sell him my bigger dog for $10. I told him he wasn't for sale and he moved on. Maybe he just wanted a companion but It just gave me a weird vibe."

31,168376079,Perla Mendoza,• Central Park,22w,It does and it is a learning lesson for everyone. But right now it’s more about how we can be there for one another as a community. She’s just asking kindly for help and if you are able to help out than kindly do so. We are not here to make people feel bad more than they already are.(edited)

2,155315516,Stephen Milner,• Mayfair,19 Jul,Did you get a timely response? Are the people ok? Did you see or hear anything before the shots?
3,155315516,Rob Juarez,• Lowry,19 Jul,I was on hold with 911 for about 30 sec but ambulance and police arrived pretty fast. The victim was conscious when taken by EMTs.
4,155315516,Ginny Lupo,• Lowry,19 Jul,"Robyn, it is traumatic to witness something like that.  I believe DPD has psychologists or similar who are available to witnesses who need a little help processing.  I’m sure this experience is all you’ll be able to think about for awhile.  It sounds like you did the right thing calling 911 and staying nearby (hope you didn’t feel like you were in danger).  Take care of yourself too now."

17,155315516,Ray Tug,• Lowry,19 Jul,Great point.  Passion runs deep these days and so does feeling like a person has to defend their position or stance.  Easy to get off topic when emotions are charged.

19,155315516,Rob Juarez,• Lowry,19 Jul,I was surprised to see that the police did not tape anything off and any investigating was quick and short. They just looked around with flashlights and were gone.
20,155315516,Ana Azmitia,• Woodside Village,19 Jul,I saw in the CBS this morning that the gun shots were in Alameda and Fairmount?
21,155315516,Judy Tisdale,• Windsor Gardens East,19 Jul,I heard from a reliable source that there was a double shooting at 8500 E Alameda last nite.  I think that is Woodside Village.  There were many shootings last nite in the metro area.

0,176209324,David A.,• University Hills,7 Feb,Some? How about the vast majority of neighborhoods think this specific plan is very flawed and needs to be readdressed with some equity and no special interests on the design team.
1,176209324,Dana S.,• Cherry Creek North,7 Feb,"More than 80% of every Denver neighborhood strongly opposed this insane bill in the Fall, forcing city council to withdraw passing it. This version is still not acceptable. Council clearly is still failing to hear that they Wirker for us and are supposed to represent our needs and desires."
2,176209324,Susan C.,• University Park,7 Feb,"This GLA is really just changing the ordinance to make money for entities like Queen City Cooperative, other density developers and corrections companies. I mean look who sat on the GLA planning group and pulled Hancock’s, City Council’s and Webb’s strings for two years. And Sarah Wells and the others living at the coop on Cap Hill are Queen City’s shills..."
3,176209324,Julio T.,• Alamo Placita,9 Feb,"Queen City Cooperative is literally just some people who live in one house who want to be legally allowed to do so. They aren't developers or anything like that at all. I know who they are and literally they are like teachers, artists, a web developer. They are a chosen family who want to legally be allowed to live like one and want to allow other chosen families to be allowed the same."

7,176209324,Ben E.,• Highland,7 Feb,"How the hell is this what's going to damage neighborhoods? You wanna know why people are living together? It's because they're broke and group living is efficient and more affordable. Maybe if by ""damage"" you mean lower the median income - in that case, you're the problem, not the ordinance."
8,176209324,Dana S.,• Cherry Creek North,7 Feb,"Ben I would hope everyone can understand you valid point. At the same time, city council members are elected by the residents of Denver and their neighborhood. Their job is to serve the people. Over 80% strongly opposed this proposal and that hasn’t changed. The majority of Denver has spoken and it is council’s job to listen."

14,176209324,Cheryl Shoup,• Mar Lee,7 Feb,We are very opposed to this also. The parking on our street is bad enough now.  We have 4 houses just on our end of the block that have numerous people living in one house and they have between 5 & 10 cars at each house.
15,176209324,Julio T.,• Alamo Placita,9 Feb,"Yes and now they are legally allowed to live there, so why don't you mind your own business? Because guess what, you don't own the parking in front of your house."
16,176209324,Christine H.,• City Park West,9 Feb,one small reason i don't own a car. i'm in deeply dense city park west and several of my neighbors are car-less. it can be done. i realize it doesn't work for everyone.
17,176209324,Ryk M.,• Hampden,7 Feb,When I see comments on this subject I'm reminded of a quote by the famous Dr. Peter Venkman: “Human sacrifice! Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!”
18,176209324,Ryk M.,• Hampden,7 Feb,"Paige Burkeholder - Wow! Not a single accusation that you just levied at me is true, and I challenge you to show otherwise or retract what you said. If the amendment passes, the only thing I'll be doing is NOT worrying about my property's value, my safety, or my neighborhood's character. You know as well as I do that just because someone supports the amendment, it doesn't mean that they need to do anything personally to help the people who will be helped by it -- no more than you would need to do something personally if you were advocating for, say, extra funding for policing. It's a policy change, not a crusade."
19,176209324,Ryk M.,• Hampden,9 Feb,"As you can see, she removed her comment, part of which accused me of calling her a white, privileged woman. My conversations with her were were always civil, and I think that I just got under her skin by continually correcting her misinformation."
20,176209324,Paige Burkeholder,• Southmoor Park East,10w,Here is more information that the City hasn’t shared:  https://us17.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=5d2c19537162f3f275a0316fa&id=c599bec59d
21,176209324,Kathleen M.,• Indian Creek,7 Feb,"No one has mentioned another main concerns, halfway houses for drug/criminal/other facilities to be set up throughout the city.  Now they are concentrated near downtown or by correctional facilities.  City Council wants more options where to put them, regardless of bus routes, job availability or easy access to meetings."
22,176209324,Julio T.,• Alamo Placita,9 Feb,This isn't true...halfway houses would only be allowed along commercial corridors.
23,176209324,Jeannine S.,• Cook Park,8 Feb,It’s only fair the City should be allowed more options! Why should low income parts of town  always be the ones to get these type of places!?
24,176209324,CJ Steffen,• Hilltop,9 Feb,any updates here?
25,176209324,Courtney Copp,• University Hills,9 Feb,It passed 11-2!

27,176209324,Rita R.,• Yosemite-Cherry Creek Townhomes,9 Feb,Well good news or bad news it passed 11 to 2.  So I guess we will see.
28,176209324,CJ Steffen,• Hilltop,9 Feb,i thought 80% strongly opposed the measure?
29,176209324,Julio T.,• Alamo Placita,9 Feb,So happy that City Council did the right thing! Not the only solution to Denver's affordability issues but a much needed step in providing equity throughout the city.

24,169715464,Betty Martinez,• Explorador Calle,5 Dec,We are quarantined my husband and granddaughter positive for COVID 19. NO work no money. We have 9 in our family. I will try this

26,169715464,Deslie Mernedakis,• Old Thornton,20w,"I am not incapable of helping, i can use  my time to help. I can cook for a family who needs a break. I can help with my time at night as long As It is safe for me and my son.. i will rise up.(edited)"
27,169715464,Yazmin Saenz,• Wandering View,5 Dec,"Just an idea, you could make some type of Christmas ornaments, center pieces, decorations, and sell them! There are a lot of free Christmas items in the free/for sale section! Good Luck!"
28,169715464,Deslie Mernedakis,• Old Thornton,7 Dec,"Yazmin Saenz that is a great Idea. But i want to be honest, i cannot add more stress and things to do on my plate right now. Maybe something extra i can do in the summer for bazarre sales. I will try to sell what I have at the house to temporarily help me. Then make extra job or crafts to sell."
29,169715464,Julianna Kendall,• City View,7 Dec,"I don't have much in the way of money, but I can offer an ear to listen and some company. I have a 4 year old daughter and a 2 year old son, the kids could play together."

0,182533178,Emma Griffis,• Congress Park,6 Apr,This is awesome!
1,182533178,Lane O’Connor,• Hale,6 Apr,Heck yeah! This is wonderful!
0,156795564,Peter M.,• Baker,2 Aug,My opinion:
1,156795564,Darlene Hurley,• Happy Canyon,2 Aug,The problem with the state doing it is that they can't get their own computer programs to work. Look at how often everything is down in the state. You would never have any internet service if they were doing it.
2,156795564,James L.,• Capitol Hill SW,2 Aug,"Yes, the law was rammed through by telecom lobbyists to make it harder for anyone to compete with them. Those communities that HAVE won locally (Longmont is one exqmple) have seen business growth and consumer satisfaction."
3,156795564,Patrick Payne,• East Colfax,2 Aug,Not just Denver but the state. The internet should be a public utility
4,156795564,Cindy Gioffredi,• Mir Park,2 Aug,"Internet as a public utility would allow the powers that be to monitor ALL our private info, etc. Not for me."
5,156795564,Mark Halfhill,• Washington Park East,2 Aug,Those days are long past. Your cellular posting is monitored as well.
6,156795564,Lisa R.,• Platt Park,37w,"If you use Google, Apple, or Amazon they already have very bit of private information about you."
7,156795564,Robert W.,• Cheesman Park,2 Aug,They need to make it so cable companies have to compete with each other versus only one in each state.
8,156795564,Anna McCaffery,• Congress Park,2 Aug,Multiple competitors with a requirement for a basic level so that all school children get it for free to do homework.
9,156795564,STEVE HARLEY,• Baker,2 Aug,Comcast and CenturyLink certainly don’t prove that private enterprise is the best solution to providing what has become an essential service
10,156795564,Traci Hannah,• DIA,2 Aug,"of course not, let companies do what they do best, the City has enough on its plate, this seems silly but i may be missing something.  (25years in telecom)"
11,156795564,June Schumacher,• Dartmouth Heights,3 Aug,Very true.  The city can’t even manage the city.
12,156795564,June Schumacher,• Dartmouth Heights,3 Aug,No
13,156795564,Ron T.,• Baker,3 Aug,No
14,156795564,T.A. O.,• Cherry Creek North,3 Aug,Good grief! Something else the City can screw up
15,156795564,STEVE HARLEY,• Baker,3 Aug,"i don’t know that private enterprise will ever make an essential service equitable, but would folks support rules to make internet services a truly competitive market?"
16,156795564,Aimee Rullo,• Skyland,4 Aug,I disagree with this statement. I'm in telecom (and have been for a long time) and my sole job is to sell to small ISPs. There are a TON! Even in Denver. You just need to look them up.
17,156795564,STEVE HARLEY,• Baker,4 Aug,"Aimee Rullo i know there are a few small ISPs left; the ones that survived have found niches, such as Forethought that has its own cable in parts of downtown, and focuses primarily on full service business accounts"
18,156795564,Chris C.,• Hampden South,3 Aug,No
19,156795564,Ann Brannan Joyce,• Holly Hills,3 Aug,No!
20,156795564,Charlie H.,• Cherry Creek North,3 Aug,"It works in Fort Collins, it can and should absolutely be done here."
21,156795564,Charles Telles,• Green Valley Ranch,3 Aug,"Denver isn't capable of taking care of anything presently and they think they can run this, what a joke. The state isn't anymore capable. Our governor didn't even know there was a homeless camp right outside his windiw."
22,156795564,STEVE HARLEY,• Baker,3 Aug,"the ballot issue in question wouldn’t set up a city internet service, it would just cancel a state prohibition on doing so; that prohibition is a strategic obstacle put in place in 2005"
23,156795564,Tanner Axt,• Wash Park West,4 Aug,Yes! Give me municipal broadband and someone who I can hold accountable in an election if everything isn't working!
24,156795564,Chandler Sinclair,• South Park Hill,4 Aug,"Yes! Look what a tiny town in Chattanooga,TN was able to pull off by taking their internet public: https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/15/9543839/chattanooga-tennessee-just-found-out-its-getting-the-fastest-internet"
25,156795564,John W.,• Hampden South,4 Aug,"Yes! Something needs to be done about the availability and quality of internet access not only here but country wide. The government and Ajit Pai have stopped competition from ISP’s thereby guaranteeing higher prices and lower quality from the provider(s) in your area. Look at Europe and major developed countries and see what kind of internet speed, pricing and quality they have, it puts our country to shame. We need to start somewhere and this is as good a place as any."
0,167939063,Bev Laughlin,• Historic Montclair,15 Nov,I don't shop there for that reason.  Hate how they refigured the store.
1,167939063,Abeth Parisian,• East Colfax,15 Nov,Agree. The new updated layout makes absolutely no sense. Even workers hate it.
2,167939063,Shannon Stevenson,• Skyland,15 Nov,"They were very active about social distance, but now it seems about everybody is getting relaxed about covid. I work in healthcare and I'm glad to see n hear that some ppl are still practicing social distance. Big thank you."
3,167939063,Liz LaRue,• Northeast Park Hill,15 Nov,That King Sooper is horrible for everything. I used to live in Mayfair and avoided that store like the plague. Now that may be literal.
4,167939063,Gabriela Carrion,• Hale,15 Nov,The name says it all: SAFE-way!😂
5,167939063,Stephanie Schilken,• South Park Hill,15 Nov,"Yeah, I switched to Safeway too for the same safety concerns."
6,167939063,Joan Beam,• South Park Hill,15 Nov,"Safeway is clean and safe, aisle directions, social distancing spacing.  That Mayfair King Sooper is the exact opposite - I will not shop there."
7,167939063,Maricela Sanchez,• Hale,15 Nov,"I dont shop there anymore I go to the leetsdale one and there's alot of people there too 😒 can barely go thru aisles, I agree tho with the safeway krameria there's not a lot people there looks pretty clean too"
8,167939063,Carol Hunter,• Central Park,15 Nov,They’ve been erratic for months. Let Kroger corporate know. We feel safe at Trader Joe’s and Sprouts especially the new one in Central Park.  I compliment them every time I go.
9,167939063,Julie Reusser,• South Park Hill,16 Nov,Totally agree with Trader Joe’s- they are wonderful!
10,167939063,Lulu Dorner,• Mayfair,16 Nov,"Yeah! Trader Joe’s is the best! Clean, safe and the associates always very helpful and respectful! 👍🏼"
11,167939063,Sherry Stevenson,• Central Park,15 Nov,We haven’t shopped King Sooper for months now.  They were slack at the time when it began.   We love Trader Joe’s/Sprouts we always feel safe there and the Safeway in Lowry. We only shop there the products we cannot purchase at TJ/Sprouts.
12,167939063,Joanne Spillman,• South Park Hill,16 Nov,"Isn't Safeway more expensive? I could be wrong, though. I admit the Safeway in Mayfair is cleaner and more spread out than KS, though."
13,167939063,Andrew Sweet,• South Park Hill,15 Nov,Ditto to all the above.  I go to KS at 6-7 am on weekday.  Only way it makes any sense.  Safeway seems much better. Just need to break thirty years habit!!
14,167939063,Tim Townsend,• Mayfair,15 Nov,Sounds like a great question for King Soopers management.
15,167939063,Joanne Spillman,• South Park Hill,16 Nov,"They don't care. I know plenty of people have complained, but nothing ever changes."
16,167939063,Josh Joshua,• East Colfax,15 Nov,"In this election year, we can vote with our feet. I like Safeway on Quebec and 1st. Immaculate and well organized."
17,167939063,Sandra Stangle,• South Park Hill,15 Nov,I would also recommend NOT doing curbside pickup at the Mayfair King Sooper.  The last time I did curbside they gave me less than half of my order but charged me for everything.  It took three weeks to get my money refunded.  This included going through their corporate office.  Since that time I have done curbside pickup at the south Monaco location with no problems.  I am thinking of switching to Safeway or Walmart for my curbside orders.
18,167939063,Carol Fields,• Congress Park,16 Nov,"I have had no problem at all with pickup at King Sooper Mayfair.   When they substitute, they charge the lower price."
19,167939063,Nicole Montoya,• Morris Heights,15 Nov,I was there today and notice the same thing its irritating
20,167939063,Jon Honegger,• South Park Hill,15 Nov,I once watched a guy blast a farmers blow out onto the floor in the entrance. No one even flinched.....
21,167939063,Liz LaRue,• Northeast Park Hill,15 Nov,I 💯 believe that’s true
22,167939063,Kevin Finnerty,• Congress Park,15 Nov,Social distancing seems to have ended the day that masks started.
23,167939063,Robin Howe,• Hale,15 Nov,That store has been a train wreck since Jack left
24,167939063,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,15 Nov,We should report them to the Department of Health they will be closed down.
25,167939063,Kevin Finnerty,• Congress Park,15 Nov,Health department doesn't care. There's a store in town with 12 confirmed cases & they list it as 2 & do absolutely nothing.
26,167939063,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,16 Nov,Really? I know Tri-County Health certainly does. If you report it they go directly to the store
27,167939063,Stephanie Bean,• City Park,15 Nov,"I ordered from them for pick up occasionally as previous order fulfillments have been lacking.  I do the Target drive up in Glendale, it quick and easy.  If they don’t have what I ordered, I know ahead of time and can figure it out. I’m doing my best to stay away from people as we have a kid and a baby and can’t get sick and parent at the same time!"

Shots hear in my alley, called 911, 3am, ambul took him off, police show at 4, detectives swarming neighborhood. fingerprints and search vehicle, said vic is alive, but 3 in the body. Very Scary. The police have been around all day, the alley is becoming a murderer's row. lots of dope, scary people, homeless, trash, Enough to make me a God believer, but thank God I'm an atheist."
10,160485557,Dagny Jean,• Historic Montclair,7 Sep,Thank God.
11,160485557,Janice McGuire,• East Colfax,6 Sep,It was a busy night for the police.  Gunshots near Batavia (1650) and Quince about 2:15 a.m. We called police.
12,160485557,Margaret Myers,• South Park Hill,7 Sep,I heard 6 shots at 4:45 am Monday morning. Close to Colfax and Monaco.
13,160485557,LInda Poletti,• South Park Hill,13 Sep,"Hi Margaret. We heard the shots fired (exact time/ 5-6 shots) you mention at 17th and Monaco. It was the day AFTER the alley incident on 9/6 where someone was shot. We called the police and then scanned next door all day but never saw anything about it on next-door so we started to think that we dreamed it, or that it was fireworks.  "
14,160485557,Daniel Pearl,• North Park Hill,9 Sep,Are real gun folks ok with the wrong people having guns just because they population control themselves?
15,160485557,Joe Smith,• Mayfair,10 Sep,The so-called real gun folks are the same ones who stole this nation. So when we speaking  of the wrong people having guns we should look at the culture of guns. Unfortunately the so-called bad people with guns are only killing themselves
16,160485557,Daniel Pearl,• North Park Hill,10 Sep,Right. Or threatening and hurting good people. 
17,160485557,Katy Allen,• North Park Hill,10 Sep,Yeah been happened for ten years at my house. It’s better than it used to be but seems to have spiked again recentlu
18,160485557,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,11 Sep,"There was something going on along Colfax this afternoon about 3pm. I drove past a couple fire trucks and several police vehicles with a bunch of people standing around. It was on the south side of Colfax and I was heading west so I couldn't really see anything much about what was going on except for all the vehicles with flashing lights. A few blocks further west at a pawn shop, I think, there were a couple more police vehicles and the police were removing yellow tape that had basically blocked off the entire corner of the street where the pawn shop is. I don't know if those things were related or not, but it sure was a lot of police activity in a short stretch along Colfax this afternoon."

0,182398376,Bobby Yocum,• Central Park,4 Apr,SlingTV is probably the cheapest option and starts at $35 per month and then you can add packages onto it
1,182398376,Gloria McGrath,• Central Park,5 Apr,"Do you know with sling TV (Is consider blue for $35/month since has a bit more Sports channels). if there are other hidden charges for remotes? If I choose sling TV can that same premium be used on other TVs in the home? If I chose sling TV, does their adapter enhance reception, which cable does now?  Also, Xfinity told me if I cut the cable and just kept the Internet that Internet would cost me $60 per month. Does that seem reasonable?"
2,182398376,Deb Barela,• Central Park,5 Apr,I will go into the xfinity store ever so often and renegotiate.  They always have a better deal for me.  I thought the same thing about changing but also concerned I’ll end up at the same price by the time I add in what we watch...
3,182398376,Barbara Smith,• Lowry,5 Apr,"I cut the cable but the problem was finding the lowest internet provider.  Not much choice, either Comcast or Century Link.  After you find the internet provider then there are great apps you can buy.  I found MSNBC only offered by 2 different apps.  First is  Hulu plus about $65/mo or Sling blue 35/mo .  Sling has 2 packages Orange, mostly sports and Blue which has MSNBC.  You can spend about $45/mo for both Orange and Blue on Sling or just buy either separately for about $35/mo."
4,182398376,Gloria McGrath,• Central Park,5 Apr,"Actually, after I did my Sling homework, it’s the blue that provides more sports and red zone can be added on for $10 per month. To get both the orange and the blue would cost $50 to bundle."

However, I feel it needs to be said: First, and foremost, I highly doubt everyone who is shooting off fireworks each time is jumping onto Nextdoor to see what their neighbors have to say. IF you're capable of being calm and kind, I would suggest trying to talk directly to those shooting fireworks off (but only if you're capable of turning off the 'Karen' in you). It may not stop the fireworks completely, but if you approach them RESPECTFULLY, you may see a conscious effort to tone it down by your neighbors. "

11,154627634,Hawk C.,• University Hills,13 Jul,It’s just what they want....this way they can pass legislation without any face-to-face interaction with their constituents.  Typical of the left leaning city council and the local government.

13,154627634,Gayle G.,• Cherry Creek East,13 Jul,"Was driving pass Wash Park on Downing last week.  2 homeless men - 1 could barely stand with the help of the bench, the other on the ground trying to get up but couldn't.  If I wouldn't have had a friend's child, I would have stopped to help.  There were several people walking/jogging within a few feet but didn't bother to help.  I wonder if these were some of the same people who felt the need to attempt to shame me for suggesting money be given to homeless shelters rather than dangerous street corners.  Just sayin', lol."
14,154627634,Rolly Carve,• Highland,13 Jul,You’re welcomed to advocate for bringing back state asylums with us.  Think of it as a large park surrounded by living/medical facilities that takes care of them outside the city. It starts by getting the city council to demand such change.

16,154627634,Adam Estroff,• Baker,13 Jul,The online meetings I've attended have still been pretty robust for communication and deliberation. Around the country there's actually been an improvement in the diversity of attendance at public meetings because of the virtual changes.

How about canceling the $60,000 per day Convention Ctr contract for COVID beds we never needed or used? It runs through 12/31/2020. Do the math, CO could use that money for food banks or other useful issues. Stop the spending for political reasons. This is not a p***ing contest."

What can a few lights and maybe a security guard or two cost. Are they calculating in lost revenue for conventions/trade shows? I e-mailed our council member and, of course, got no response. Can anyone shed light on this?"
22,154627634,STEVE HARLEY,• Baker,13 Jul,"the city contracts with a private company to operate the Convention Center; under the contract, the city has to pay that company when it uses the facility"
23,154627634,Angie H.,• Historic Montclair,14 Jul,"Legislating virtually is absolutely not better or comparable—nor does it encourage transparency, accountability, engagement or deliberation. It is also a woefully inadequate replacement for in-person legislating. Virtual participation (allowing testimony for constituents who cannot be there) should augment to allow for wider participation and more transparency- but it’s a poor substitute for the whole process and no one should be okay with this ever becoming standard operating procedure (in the case anyone argues for it) Being a legislator is not an at-home work opportunity."

11,148290958,Kristabell Johnson,• Sable Altura Chambers,49w,"If it bothers you to see people without a home camping then do something about it that helps them. Get them some homes or help the get a job or in some cases help them get mental help or detoxed. Some people work and are homeless. I have known several people over my lifetime that have been homeless and go to work everyday. Just be thankful that it is not you trying to find a place to stay and struggling. Be grateful for the home, vehicle and friends that you have. With the economy as screwed as it is anyone could become homeless at this point.(edited)"
12,148290958,Linda Bailey,• Norfolk Glenn,16 May,You are right to a point. There are alot of them that don't want help or are beyond help. They chose to drink or do drugs that put them in those situations.  Some probably were given help but went back to there addiction.  They don't want to deal with every day life because of their choices. Homeless people will always be but our government needs to step up and help to provide them a place to camp and provide restrooms and dumpsters. I know it takes money but doesn't it take money to clean up after them. Remember some of these people are VETERANS!!
13,148290958,April Chase,• Sable Altura Chambers,15 May,"Aren’t any of us just a pay check (or unemployment check) away from a similar situation? What’s embarrassing is that as a society, we have allowed our neighbors to live like this. Maybe embarrassing isn’t the word. It’s tragic."

20,148290958,Mary M Anderson,• Lyn Knoll,16 May,Janey this might be b out of your comfort zone so call your council representative for your area. Not sure who? Call AccessAurora! Look it up. Every complaint has to be addressed. There is a reason I love Aurora. I  lived in another part of Aurora for 22 years
21,148290958,Jodi Garza,• Sable Altura Chambers,15 May,Have you stopped  and asked them what they need ??
22,148290958,Jancy S.,• Copper Flats,16 May,"My neighbor asked them once and they said they were just looking for a phone they lost. They've never been in my home so the phone isn't in there. I learned at a young age, you don't open your door for strangers. Its just common sense."
23,148290958,Pete Jend,• Apache Mesa,16 May,The large camps started way before the xx virus.  Denver routinely pushes them out of their city into neighboring areas. Hickenlooper even used buses to move the homeless outside of Denver.
24,148290958,Mary M Anderson,• Lyn Knoll,16 May,"I remember going on a ride a long with APD in the mid 80s. Around  11 or 12 pm., we made our way round to going into the White Spot. There four homeless were encountered. All 4 were shown the way into Denver. Denver has the shelters. Aurora didn't!!"
25,148290958,Pete Jend,• Apache Mesa,16 May,"There is a very successful working model in Florida. Privately funded and managed. It provides small shelters, security, job assistance and more. The only reason it won't work here is it takes too much power away from the local governments."
26,148290958,Debbie Brown,• Hoffman Heights,16 May,My experience with the City of Aurora is that they will do nothing. I was directed to the Homeless Task Force and got a run around.
27,148290958,Pete Jend,• Apache Mesa,16 May,"Perhaps more complaints would help?  I had a situation with a small group, about 4 people, living under a bicycle/pedestrian bridge.  I complained about the human waste. The city delivered a porta-a-potty. I also complained about the piles of trash they dumped on my property. The city came and picked it up.  I guess the city got tired of cleaning, so they had steel grates/fencing welded around the area to keep people out."
28,148290958,Jessica Meadows,• Norfolk Glenn,16 May,"Homelessness is a problem but people bickering isn’t a solution. Councilmember Hiltz claims the city offers many resources for homelessness, it does require more then one person filling out a form for them to do something though. And I wouldn’t walk in to a homeless camp alone and “ask them what they need.” That’s naive. The city does need more and better solutions and to add more resources before Aurora looks like downtown Denver. :("
29,148290958,Jennifer P.,• Highline Villages,17 May,"They do offer resources, but never enough. It is so sad. How many women, men, and children are turned away because all the beds for the evening have been taken? Public housing and the section 8 list has a wait list of roughly 2 years. Emergency cases are moved to the front of the line occasionally."
30,148290958,Becky Loescher,• Highline Villages,16 May,"There are a couple of documentaries which give a good look at homelessness.  ""Poverty, Inc.""  and ""When Helping Hurts"""

2,133747650,Sadie Martin,• East Colfax,7 Jan 20,She didn’t say the geese poop caused the seizures directly. The seizures were a result of the giardia which was caused by the geese poop. She wasn’t spreading incorrect or false information. Read carefully.
3,133747650,JA Schmalen,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,1y,No but giardia can lead to dehydration.mineral loss and many other things that can cause seizures in certain animals.

My vet told me it isn’t a concern but after reading this I know it is. My dog likes to smell it but I don’t let him stay stagnate on it long enough to eat it.
8,133747650,Traci Collins,• Windsor Gardens East,7 Jan 20,This is why parks and rec is right to kill enough of them to cut down on the number of geese in public parks. I just wish they would thin out some of the flocks in our neighborhood. Goose poop is the only kind of poop my dog likes and he loves it. Finding walking routes without goose poop is a major challenge.
9,133747650,Sue Phillips,• Lowry,7 Jan 20,"Yeah, I hear you, but this was their stopping off point for years before Lowry neighborhood existed.  I say no to thinning out the heard.  I just avoid certain areas.  My dogs got better health care then I give myself.  My vet was very clear with me she probably had the seizure from the geese poop.  I took her to Alameda emergency vets that night and they gave her a medication and told me to give her another pill at 0500.  I did and was at Belcaro’s door 08:00 when they opened.  He asked me to let him have her for the day.  You could tell he was upset about the med I gave her as he felt it was too strong for her.  He wanted to flush it out of her system.  She was drunk.  That afternoon he informed me she had girardia and he then informed me that giradia can cause seizures in dogs.  He asked me to take her home and bring her back the next day.  I did.  (I was off).  Every day that week she went in for a check up, and she died on Friday.  She developed a respiratory infection Friday and he felt it was too much for her.  Up until the seizure she had been great."
10,133747650,Sadie Martin,• East Colfax,7 Jan 20,"Hmmm. Nope. Instead of killing innocent animals, maybe don’t let your dog eat geese poop? I have lived here for 4 years and the geese have never been a problem for me or my dogs."
11,133747650,Traci Collins,• Windsor Gardens East,7 Jan 20,I wish they would restrict themselves to one area. I live in Windsor Gardens and we have so much grass it is a goose buffet. It seems like areas change on almost a daily basis.

Maybe if the Department of Parks and Recreation would be transparent about how the geese are murdered, there would be an even greater outcry to spare them.

Alameda deemed him well enough to travel from there to the shelter yesterday. They said they will be doing a full exam at some point today. She told me that they believe the weight and slender build are most likely due to his advanced age...think at least 8 if not older. He’s not chipped as well, so not sure if he’ll be picked up.

I would encourage bringing him to a shelter ASAP with the changing weather. :)

2,169110599,Fi Choate,• Central Park,28 Nov,See you have tried honey.........take a tablespoon on honey and sprinkle cinnamon on it.  I use a decent amount of cinnamon and the combination seems to help.
3,169110599,Jason Lopez,• DIA,28 Nov,This plus whiskey in as a warmed drink is called a hot toddy and it helped my mom with her cough allot.

7,169110599,Anna Hartt,• Sable Altura Chambers,28 Nov,"You must push liquids.  It helps to thin out the mucus.  Honey and lemon tea are great.  Hot liquids help to calm the spasms.  Take a hot shower and breathe in the steam.  Use eucalyptus and menthol to open passages.  Then, stand in front of the freezer and breathe cold air.  Vicks on the feet with socks helps.  Peppermint oil on you chest helps to keep passages open also."

9,169110599,Yolanda Harris,• Green Valley Ranch,28 Nov,"Sounds like your body needs a boost of vitamin c and d. Walmart sells a product called Immune Defense. It’s a powdered mix. Add it to your favorite drink or water. Guarantee you will feel better soon. Also, Emergen-c works too."
10,169110599,Ruby Robledo,• Montbello,28 Nov,Yes I am drinking it I have some orange and raspberry flavored trust me I’m trying it all lol i also got them Ricola drops and they help for little while
11,169110599,Victoria Gonzales,• Green Valley Ranch,28 Nov,You may have heartburn/ acid reflex. Try Pepcid Complete chewable tablets. I had a cough that lasted a month. I was seen by my doctor and the diagnosed me with heartburn acid reflux. I took one once a day for a week and the cough went away.
12,169110599,Ruby Robledo,• Montbello,28 Nov,Idk I don’t think it’s a heartburn the doc had said it was flem infection in my lungs it had a lot of fluid and  yes this cough feel like it wants to be around that long 😫😫😫it’s been two long miserable weeks and I hate to be going to the stores to buy more meds and freaking ppl out thinking i got that 🦠 virus so I try my hardest to suck it up run in and out 😫
13,169110599,Sheila Custard,• Green Valley Ranch,21w,"Don’t lay flat, prop yourself up with a few pillows and use a humidifier.

15,169110599,Marcy Blankenship,• Green Valley Ranch,28 Nov,"I once worked for a doctor that said when you have a cough that's that bad, only a cough medicine with codeine works. They don't like to give it to you these days, but you can try."
16,169110599,Michelle Bowers,• Bluff Lake Aurora,28 Nov,Agree with “honey lemon water” as my mom called it. Only thing that worked for me as a kid when I was up coughing all night. Works for my son now too. Good amount of honey and lemon juice squeezed into hot water. It has never failed me.
17,169110599,barbara rhoades,• Locust St,28 Nov,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322394#twelve-natural-cough-remedies    just read that a cup of chopped red bell peppers has more vitamin  c than an orange.   pineapple will help cut the phlegm.....  get better.  garlic is a powerful antibiotic.
18,169110599,Ruby Robledo,• Montbello,28 Nov,Would garlic 🧄 pills be okay
19,169110599,barbara rhoades,• Locust St,29 Nov,Ruby Robledo i am sure it would be the same
20,169110599,Marlissa Netzel,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,28 Nov,You have an acute case of bronchontis. Call your provider see if they will give you tesslon perles and robitussin with codeine. You might need an antibiotic. You can do a vitual Tele med appt with them.  You actually got a covid test saying negative? Vaporizer helps a cool mist one with distilled water . you can use vicks. Honey and lemon in hot water is good. But you have this reactive air way cough that is throwing you into asthma.  Do you have a nebulizer machine.  Your provider can help you get one
21,169110599,Ruby Robledo,• Montbello,28 Nov,Hi yes i actually went to the hospital Denver health she did give me pills to kill the infection for 4 days and was negative for covid . She did do an X-ray I demanded it and she said she had want to do it but she said no I don’t have bronchitis nor what I though pulmonary she said X-rays look fine but full of infection and we’re swollen she also make me take a steroid for inflammation and she did give me a instrument with a different inhaler because that night I could breath so now I just have a cough 😷
22,169110599,Nicole Montoya,• Morris Heights,28 Nov,Hope you feel better make you a telephone apt try lime and hunny like a tea
23,169110599,Ruby Robledo,• Montbello,28 Nov,Yes thanks my oldest daughter actually made me a tea like that and helped for a bit

25,169110599,Jim Freelong,• Morris Heights,28 Nov,Are you positive for COVID-19?
26,169110599,Ruby Robledo,• Montbello,28 Nov,No i was negative. I had covid late September none of those symptoms I have just bad bad cough and flem like crazy 😝  and wheezing every time I inhale sounds like I’m whistling 😙 my lil kid tells me stop whistling mom 😳😫😫😫😫😫
27,169110599,Robert Polk,• Del Mar Parkway,28 Nov,Brocolin is the best!! With ginger n chamomile tea
28,169110599,Ella Hawk,• Parkfield,28 Nov,You could try avoiding dairy to lesson the phlegm production. My brother-in-law swears by a shot of whisky to cure a sore throat lol
29,169110599,Angel Acosta,• Montbello,28 Nov,Agreed. Dairy and any cold liquids tend to create extra phlegm - stay away from both till this has passed. Stick to room temperature or hot liquids in the mean time. Hope you get better soon!
30,169110599,Janet McKinley,• Green Valley Ranch,28 Nov,"I've been coughing since June 2019. They have done so many tests and I'm ""normal "". I do have asthma and the cough started with an exacerbation of asthma. My pulmonologist and ENT both gave me this advice- it doesn't fix it,  but minimizes the severity.  Avoid all menthol products- only cough drop without menthol that is also sugar free is Halls Breeze. Your pharmacy can order these for you. "
31,169110599,Ruby Robledo,• Montbello,28 Nov,Yes I got them it has helped a bit and then menthol ricola have helped more then halls for me
32,169110599,Janet McKinley,• Green Valley Ranch,20w,Menthol does contribute as an irritant so if it helps you that is good.  Just keep in mind it may contribute to the irritation causing the cough.  I really hope you get better more quickly than me.(edited)
33,169110599,Beth Ashley,• Montbello,28 Nov,Boil fresh thyme then in  Inhale vapors
34,169110599,Sheila Carvajal,• Green Valley Ranch,28 Nov,"If you have asthma you shouldn't be taking musinex that will make it worse I have asthma and it made symptoms worse if have you tried hot water lemon and honey with a little red pepper I know it may be hard to drink but a woman I worked with made for me and it helped me try a couple times a day see if it will help and do the vicks on your chest, neck and back that will loosen your mucus."
35,169110599,David Navarro,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,28 Nov,"Get a prescription to TRELEGY!  I actually had something like it that seemed to hang on for almost 4 years & a 1/2 a doz different doctors-  None could figure it out!  Doc was on vacation & who ever was filling in prescribed it for me, took only 2 days to start fixing me!  (You can get a coupon at their Website for 1 year Free)  This drug changed my life!

At Coors field with my wife and kids right field upper deck, down 3 runs bottom of the 9th bases juiced, Jason Giambi at the plate, crack of the bat and that little white ball kept getting bigger and bigger and the roar louder and the ball was rocketing straight up into our section and we were delirious fiving and hugging strangers."

15,155805002,David A F.,• Cherry Creek North,24 Jul,"The original Denver Bear’s stadium was on South Broadway, Merchant Park.  The baseball park moved to the edge of downtown and became the new Bear’s stadium later known as Mile High Stadium. When Denver got an AFL football team the baseball park was expanded and became both a baseball park and football stadium.  In 1995 Coors field opened in downtown Denver and the football and baseball park were once again separated."
16,155805002,David A F.,• Cherry Creek North,24 Jul,"As a kid, I saw Marvelous Marv Thronberry hit a home run that hit a light bar outside Bear’s stadium. The longest home run in Bear’s history."

1,152769055,Nancy Cord,• East Colfax,24 Jun,Omg how scary. Please stay safe. I’m not sure how a active or potential break in is low priority. Wow.
2,152769055,Danielle Shepard,• East Colfax,24 Jun,"We watched an obvious drug deal in front of our house that went on for ~25 minutes. Called right away and police never showed. This was a few weeks ago and would've been an easy arrest. I complained to our councilwoman and was put in touch with a direct police contact. Her advice was to put together a neighborhood watch for our block, and to call in, no matter how small the problem. If you have neighbors that can also see this person, ask them to call in too. DM me if you'd like the contact info I have. I know not particularly helpful in the moment, but that's what I heard from our reps."
3,152769055,Dan Braden,• South Park Hill,26 Jun,"Call the police and informing them of the problem, then when you get pushback about it being low priority, say ""OK thanks, well I'll go out and shoot them"" then hang up.  And when they show up in a minute or so, show them your camera you were going to shoot them with."
4,152769055,Jay Yoakam,• Aurora,28 Jun,Or just shoot...
5,152769055,Spencer Seber,• East Colfax,24 Jun,Call them again and tell them you don’t know if he’s armed or not. That typically gets them there asap

9,152769055,Kacey Mathews,• East Colfax,24 Jun,"The problem is what’s going in this country regarding the police. What I have heard on the news in other cities, the police aren’t showing up for certain calls that they are getting. I don’t know if you’ve notice, but the police don’t patrol this area as much as they used to before all this stuff started happening."
10,152769055,Britain Ridge,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,24 Jun,"Make sure to you take pictures( of him and damage to the fence) and when and if you have interaction with him record everything!

30,152769055,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,25 Jun,"Ian, I agree with you. Even if police did show up, in some circumstances by the time they can get there, it’s all over. The only resources you can really count on are your own abilities to try and deal with a situation. I’m not advocating a free-for-all approach; just know the reality you’re dealing with. The “protect” part of “we serve and protect” doesn’t exist any more."

3,173240403,Richard Robb,• Mayfair,9 Jan,"We curate the RTD stop trash can in front of our home on Monaco. That trash goes in our personal trash bin and out with our weekly trash. Some weeks we have 30 pounds of smelly dog poop that comes into our personal trash. Not pretty, sometimes needs tripled bagged. Please take it home. The RTD cans are not ""public"" in the way you are thinking of them."

I try to get her to go before but it doesn’t always work. There’s also nothing quite like a trash can that’s had the “poo” in it. Which is why I dutifully carry it (because she refuses), take it home and put it in my trash can."
6,173240403,Shannon Haines,• Skyland,9 Jan,Wouldn't it be great if our fur babies would carry it themselves! 😃 Maybe we should invent something that would do this like a doggy poo backpack. 😝
7,173240403,Phoenix Wren Paasch,• Hale,9 Jan,Shannon Haines I think there are some harness getups that have a poop bag roll holder and a way to stash the full bag too?  LOL
8,173240403,Christopher Smith,• Central Park,9 Jan,Used poo bag holders.  If you have a 3D printer they have patterns for these things. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3565615

10,173240403,Jacob Stackhouse,• Northeast Park Hill,10 Jan,Is it okay for a mother to put a diaper in the trash? Orrrr are we now asking her to carry that dirty diaper all the way home too??
11,173240403,Richard Robb,• Mayfair,10 Jan,"Yes, of course, if a mother is at the bus stop in my front yard and needs to put a diaper in the trash can that I curate I am happy to take care of that. Anything that a legitimate RTD patron puts in the can in my front yard I will happily take care of, because that means it is not dumped in my yard. If lazy dogwalkers or passersby decide to dump their random garbage in my curated can, then no, that is not Okay."
12,173240403,Jacob Stackhouse,• Northeast Park Hill,10 Jan,Or if a toddler gets sick in a fast food cup... can I throw away that cup and the napkins I used to clean it up?
13,173240403,Richard Robb,• Mayfair,10 Jan,"If you're waiting for the bus in my front yard, absolutely, put your toddler's puke and the napkins in my can. If you're driving by, don't. Thanks."

15,173240403,Richard Robb,• Mayfair,10 Jan,If you are waiting for the bus in my front yard...yes. If you are walking by...no. You get the gist now?

19,173240403,Andrew Sweet,• South Park Hill,10 Jan,Amidst the national insanity playing out in Washington this week I was ‘focused on a small silly thing’ like dog waste. The larger message here is a call for grace and civility- care for one another and our environment. I hope that comes through. It’s just a plain and simple request folks- hope that message is received .  Nuff said
20,173240403,Annita Menogan,• Central Park,10 Jan,"People are just asking for civility and consideration. Disagreeing is one thing. If you don’t agree, just say so as one commenter respectfully did. No wonder the country is in so much trouble. Some people just haven’t learned civility and that small things that add up to the big ones, positive and negative."
21,173240403,Laura Avant,• Northeast Park Hill,10 Jan,"Wouldn't it be great if  our leaders had learned the same.  Words did us a lot of harm this past week and the word ""pardon"" may undo all our efforts to stop this inciting rhetoric.  That is the only thing that makes Texas  more than an ugly experience IMO- people are polite and civil while they stab you in the back."
22,173240403,Kate Adams,• Mayfair,10 Jan,Thank you Andrew for caring for the RTD stops! I’d just like to echo some previous comments and share these poo-bag holders that clip onto leashes. I just bought one and it’s great for going on walks with my dog and hauling back the poo. :) This one came from bumblebeepetco.com
23,173240403,Michael Frank,• Skyland,10 Jan,"Honestly, I’m just happy people are picking up poop and not leaving it on the ground. "
24,173240403,Tatiana Masterson,• Central Park,10 Jan,"I didn’t know you were not supposed to throw poop bags in those thrash cans as I’m new in town, but I learned something new today. I always bags home unless there is a serious issue with the content that needs to thrown out right away because of leakage. I will now double bag it and do my best to make it home. Simple. 😊"

We also have a two year old and yes, we take her diapers home if she needs a change while out. Consideration for the larger community is something we all need more of."
26,173240403,David Martin,• Northeast Park Hill,10 Jan,"I agree -- take it home.  Ideally folks should flush it as it then goes through the sewer system and is treated before going back to the waterways.  Tossing it makes it end up in the landfill where it's not ideal for decomposition.  But at least folks are putting in the trash; here in my community people put it in the RECYCLE!  Yes, you read that right -- dumb *(#@^$ putting dog waste in recycle...."
27,173240403,Tatsiana Trus,• East Washington Virginia Vale,14w,Large breed dog poop will clog your toilet - you dont want to do that(edited)
28,173240403,David Martin,• Northeast Park Hill,14w,"That's a good consideration, but PetMD says the very best method is to (bagless) flush it; it doesn't offer different advice for large breed vs small breed.  All depends on your plumbing I guess.  Or if you are willing to split a larger dog's poo into a 2 separate flushes.  Flushing is absolutely the best way to dispose of dog waste hands down....both for the environment and public health.(edited)"
29,173240403,Adam Mendez,• Historic Montclair,10 Jan,"Is throwing your bagged dog waste in a trash can really that big a problem that needs to whined about on here? That being said, i do agree with not leaving it under a tree or lampost, or anywhere else that isn't a trash can."

0,172740206,Verna Salone,• Lowry,5 Jan,"I would recommend you bomb the apartment a few times, thoroughly wash and clean EVERYTHING you own before and after moving, and then bomb your new apartment as well just to make sure you don’t bring any with you. Even if you do end up bringing one or two, the bombing and cleaning in the new apartment should kill them. Be sure you clean your new apartment top to bottom before moving in as well and inspect it just to ensure you don’t find any other bugs. Sometimes when you live in an apartment building, if someone else in the building has roaches and they manage to get into your place, you won’t be able to get rid of them until the other person (or people) has gotten rid of them. Make sure you buy one of those covers that go under your door, I forget what they’re called but they’re usually to stop the draft from coming in the house. They can stop bugs from coming in as well."
1,172740206,Cortney Worrell,• Lowry,5 Jan,I would also put belongings in a truck overnight and bomb before moving into new apt.
2,172740206,Jennifer Dillon,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Jan,"Throw away all cardboard. Wrap suspect items like small appliances, etc. (toasters are famous hiding spots for those buggers) in big garbage bags and toss a bomb in with them. Treat any furniture that has particleboard (undersides of dresser drawers, etc.)."
3,172740206,Sara B.,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Jan,"Can you actually save some of the appliances that way, without ruining them!?! I don’t have many appliances or electronics, the smaller ones I could part with... but I really can’t afford to replace my TVs! The exterminators said when bombing it doesn’t always treat inside electronics"
4,172740206,Jaymes Mack,• Del Mar Parkway,5 Jan,Just burn it all down
5,172740206,Sara B.,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Jan,I wish I had the money to replace it all!!!

7,172740206,Sara B.,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Jan,Thanks Gerry! I’ll give them a call
8,172740206,Daniel Salas,• East Colfax,5 Jan,I have heard that this is very good and you can buy it from Amazon !.
9,172740206,Sara B.,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Jan,"Thanks, I’m willing to try anything!!!"
10,172740206,Amber Webb,• Morris Heights,7 Jan,"Sara Bandoni use this in your new apartment, not the old one because the infestation is moving based on tenants moving out. They go to the food sources, so I'd spend the last couple weeks at the old place not cooking and just wrapping everything in plastic. If you can afford a storage unit for a month,  that's what we did. We washed all fabrics at a laundry mat and then stored everything for a month.  We treated our new house and then put everything in the garage as we moved it in so we could check every box(I get that you might not have a garage so do it one box at a time from storage if you can). I'd also do boric acid in the new apartment too to help guarantee they die if any do transfer over. I found the most bodies in the box with my ps3."
11,172740206,Beverly Muncy Cahill,• Del Mar Parkway,5 Jan,Diatomaceous earth. It's a powdery substance you can get at Home Depot. Sprinkle it everywhere. Make sure to get food grade. It's safe for humans and pets. It cuts the exoskeleton of the pests and they dry out and die. Trust me. Look it up on Amazon and read the reviews. I had a horrible bed bug infestation. Worst time of my life. Diatomaceous earth got rid of them almost immediately. I am pest free. I always keep a rim of the powder along my floorboards.
12,172740206,Sara B.,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,5 Jan,"I struggle with this simply because I’ve heard with treatments that exterminators do, will make the diatomaceous earth solidify. Apparently you cannot do both"
13,172740206,Gloria BURNS,• East Colfax,5 Jan,"hi i had he same problem if i got rid of them in about a week.get boric acid walmart should have it,its not harmful i put it in my kitchen every where what i remember i mix it with sugar. also you can google it i promise you if you put it down you will be free of them in a week.please let me know.my son at the time was sensitive to pest decide so i had to use natural product.have a good evening let me know."
14,172740206,Gloria BURNS,• East Colfax,5 Jan,If you want to be free of roaches just use boric acid you can google it trust me it work and safe. please let me know you can get them gone in about a week
15,172740206,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,6 Jan,"I used borax powder in Texas and it kept them out, and Texas has some epic roaches"
16,172740206,Tammy Simon,• Highland Park East,5 Jan,"WHERE IS MANAGEMENT? They should be putting the monies into clearing this pest! I would of documented, pictures of this problem. If they want their rent! But Borac Acid works really well. But toasters small electronics i would get rid of. They are hard to get rid of eggs. O would bomb every little knook their was. Then send renter management all the receipts, cost it would be replacing my items. TVs, any electronics etc. They will pay me to but new ones...."
17,172740206,Nadine Rains,• Aurora,6 Jan,Management don’t care and Colorado doesn’t count it as a reason to not pay rent! I tried!
18,172740206,Theresa Venters,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Jan,I put the traps and followed instructions. They eat that bait & take it back & it kills off the colony. Because I think they eat their dead ones. Anywho it worked I killed any I saw too on the spot.
19,172740206,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,6 Jan,"Having lived in Texas where everybody has them, I can tell you that unless they get completely eliminated from your entire building, if your neighbors have them, you will have them too. "
20,172740206,Nadine Rains,• Aurora,6 Jan,"That’s what happened to me when I first moved here!!! I’ve never come in contact with those nasty things, and we had moved into one that was just crawling with them! We had to toss our couches, and all our “crevice” items like our step stools, fold up anything. We use bug barrier on EVERY EDGE AND CORNER. everything sits like an inch out and we spray every week. We also do a monthly bombing, and we use auntie fays roach spray. That stuff is HEAVEN!! Kills on contact AND is natural! When we spoke to the apartment complex, I was shaking from how disgusted I was, and they looked at me so blankly and said roaches are pretty much everywhere in urban Colorado, and if I “REALLY was worried you’d find a clean house”.... lol useless"
21,172740206,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,6 Jan,"OMG roaches are NOT everywhere in urban Colorado. It's cold here in the winter and that will kill them. They ARE everywhere in the south, but not here. Lazy, careless uncaring management!"
22,172740206,Sharon Duwaik,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,15w,You can contact Code Enforcement and or the Tri-County Health Department.  Boric Acid or diatomaceous earth works also.  ACE Hardware at 6th & Peoria is wonderful to ask for advice.(edited)
23,172740206,Sara B.,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Jan,"I tried the health dept. with “everything else going on” (IT that shall not be named; you cannot say the C word in post, apparently) i don’t think my problem is a priority."
24,172740206,Omar Cisneros,• Central Park,6 Jan,Try not to put too much chemical down. The longer you do that the more immune they will get to the chemicals. I think there are laws protecting you from this issue if you moved in with them already there. I worked doing pest control inspections before and if your neighbors don’t make as much as an effort as you they will not go away completely. I would highly recommend Cesar with Pest Protector he does a very professional and thorough job. (720) 620-3489
25,172740206,Beverly Muncy Cahill,• Del Mar Parkway,6 Jan,That's why I like diatomaceous earth.  It's not a chemical.
26,172740206,Sara B.,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Jan,"I did move in with them.... one of the employees who worked here then said everyone had a problem and moved because of it. I tried so hard to get out of my lease, contacted health dept, Colorado apartment association, wrote certified letters to management. "
27,172740206,Angel Acosta,• Montbello,6 Jan,Many good tips listed above...We too lived in TX long ago.  To keep them at bay our mom sprinkled a mix of powdered sugar and baking soda along the outside of the house and the fence.  I know it sounds weird but it worked.  You'd think ants would be attracted to it but they weren't for some reason. Dead roaches everywhere - it worked and it saved our pets from the chemical!
28,172740206,Rebecca Mayer,• Lowry,6 Jan,I bought appliances a few years back that arrived with Roaches in them took a bit for me to figure out what they were as they started as small as a tip of a pencil. (Disgusting it was). I hired Orkin and after 2 sprays they were gone.
29,172740206,Sara B.,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,6 Jan,I have a inspection with them sat! Cannot be sooner.
30,172740206,Emily Sevier,• Tava Waters,6 Jan,"I'm from Houston, and with the rain, heat and humidity, roaches are very common. Boric Acid is a common cure. It's cheap, pets won't eat it, and it has gotten rid of horrible infestations when I've moved in to new places."
31,172740206,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,6 Jan,"Anyone from Houston definitely knows roaches! I agree, boric acid/borax worked real well for me."

33,172740206,Julianne Martel,• Highland Park East,7 Jan,"fwiw - when we moved from our last apartmentwe had issues with roaches and Orkin had to come out and I multiple treatments. Apparently the roaches in CO are called German Roaches and much harder to get rid of than the ones from the South. We had tried diatomaceous earth and it didn't have much of an effect. We didn't try the dogs or bug bombs because we have pets, it was better to bring in the pros. "
34,172740206,Kayla Banks,• Hoffman Heights,7 Jan,I'll be honest with you everybody gave great advice but I'mma tell you step-by-step what you need to do we can take all your clothes at one time bag them up wash everything in your kitchen you take everything out of the cabinets wipe every cabinet every door every countertop with only bleach you clean the rest of your baseboards and your floor will bleach if you can if you cannot then go and get LA's awesome cleaner is in a yellow is yellow you can get it from Dollar Tree and use that to clean the floorboards because it won't stay in your carpet basically you need to bleach the entire house after you bleach the entire house and move everything flip over every couch open up every cabinet Kevin things that need to be covered in the directions for a bomb when you bomb put two bombs in the kitchen and one bomb everywhere else the longer that you let the bomb sit the more that it works when you come home you'll see a whole bunch of them dead man wherever get the bleach out again Andre clean and wipe down everything with only bleach after you've cleaned up you put Roach sticky pads and hotels in the corners up under the cabinets do not keep any plastic bags like from King Soopers they love them any area of your sink that is leaking water they love that make sure that gets fixed if you have any water leakage anywhere that is why they're staying the next thing you need to do is make sure you have at least three bottles of boric acid and you line the entire house in the kitchen put it behind the stove and microwave everything for the bottom drawer out of your stove and leave it out until you see that they are gone do not leave any food out do not leave any food in the sink do not leave crumbs on the table because otherwise you will continue to see them also from Home Depot you need to get a home barrier spray and you spray the whole outside of your house if you can like if you stay in an apartment spray all around your front door all of those walls that connect to somebody else's what the barrier spray and then come in the house and do every barrier floorboard up under the sinks doorways everything that connects to somebody else's house and then you should be on your way to not seeing any roaches the key thing though is bleach and keeping up all the crumbs leaving no food in the sink making sure you don't have any leaks and you should be good if you need any help text me and let me know have a good day

They then piss and moan saying nobody will help them! In order to receive the help they must stop drinking alcohol and doing illegal drugs but will not,so don't give me another sad story of how these people are victims of the system because they're not! In order for them to receive help they must first want to help themselves. My son is  addicted to methane when he received his $1,200 guess where the first place he went was! Lets just say,he didn't spend the money on new clothes,toiletries or any other essentials he spent it all smoking meth!

1,160977525,Kristabell Johnson,• Sable Altura Chambers,12 Sep,Last time they sprayed the store I had a hard time breathing and after 20 -30 min in the store I left the store. I could not get me Asthma under control and started coughing.  After I left the store it got better.  I wish I knew when they were going to spray so I could avoid the store until the spray calms.

3,160977525,Kristabell Johnson,• Sable Altura Chambers,31w,Kimberly Pearce I don’t know I think asthma is more annoying. Sometimes it slows me down or makes me take a break when I want to get things done. Don’t get me wrong if is gets very bad and I don’t have an inhaler then it can be a little scary but that is rare. Worse case I buy Primatene Mist and use that inhaler—even though those inhalers feel like they burn my lungs they work.(edited)

Several times she has been short of materials and has had a few road blocks, but always seems to find a way to make things work and makes sure she get you a mask.  My mom and best friend have also made masks for our families and it is a lot of work.  This lady is making these day in and day out for complete strangers and gifting to anyone in need.

26,146860579,KR C.,• Mar Lee,3 May,"Kay V. Not only by Saudi Arabia and Russia but also by the virus.  There have been lockdowns worldwide.  That affects the demand worldwide therefore affects the US and demand in the US therefore that is why there are layoffs and business struggling (including ours) and closing or declaring bankruptcy.  The price of crude is the lowest ever.  When the price of crude drops this low, oil and gas businesses are hard pressed to sustain themselves.  So all these items contribute to the layoffs."

Thought I was moving to a safer neighborhood.  Guess it's part of city life - we have to be careful everywhere.  But the police were very helpful in getting us our instrument back, thanks to the serial number.  And a homeless woman actually gave my nice bike back to a neighbor - the thieves must have given it to her being a woman's bike and she didn't want it."

I happened across a guy at the McDonald’s drive through on Colfax and Krameria who claimed he was from Ireland, he was robbed of his passport, etc. Real emotional story.

Targets, at least the big ones, are magnets from low level crime.  Even the ‘superstore’ is good for only packaged food goods, their meat and produce suck- and all those are limited.  I’d rather see Marcinek on Colfax expand to something like that size.  Were local grocers even solicited?"

1,162759105,Michael Warren,• Lowry,28 Sep,It doesn’t seem like anyone was shot. It happened right outside my place and I saw them speed off. I was wondering if they fired the shots in the air. I looked everywhere to see where a bullet might have struck. It was either aimed at another car or person I never saw or maybe into the air. I’ll keep posting if I hear more info. I helped the cops find the shells.
2,162759105,Laura E.,• Hilltop,28 Sep,Are there a lot of gangs in the Lowry area?
3,162759105,Ernesto PR,• Lowry,28 Sep,"With an average home price of over $700k, I doubt this is a neighborhood that a street gang can afford, or most anyone else for that matter. As a Lowry resident for the past 10yrs, no, not a single street gang originates from Lowry. There is petty theft and common crime just like anywhere else in Denver."
4,162759105,Telmahury Robledo,• Historic Montclair,28 Sep,How scary!
5,162759105,Michael Warren,• Lowry,28 Sep,They hit the bike rack and the kids bike trying to exit and drive over the sidewalk and lawn. There is no outlet behind our townhomes.
6,162759105,Andrea Sanders,• Lowry,28 Sep,Penelope saw the bikes this morning and was so sad hers and Hosea’s bikes are ruined!
7,162759105,Laurie Jensen,• East Washington Virginia Vale,28 Sep,"That’s really sad. If glad no one was hurt. I do think that it’s a little closed minded to think that gangs aren’t in lowry because the cost of living is too high. Gangs are funded by drugs and they are collectively responsible for billions of dollars in drug transactions in this country annually.  I’m sure gangs would be glad to deal out of Lowry for the same reason that the residents of Lowry love it. What keeps gangs out of neighborhoods is a close knit community and people that keep an eye out for crime. I think Lowry is like a lot of neighborhoods in Denver, people don’t talk and aren’t aware of what’s happening in the neighborhood."

21,162759105,Anne Eisen,• Windsor North,28 Sep,I also doubt police will be defunded. They need reform however or they will defund themselves from all the lawsuits. $20 million paid out from 2004 thru 2019. It’s just hard to get the bad apples out.
22,162759105,Jan H.,• Lowry,28 Sep,Its a bad orchard
23,162759105,cylie babcock,• Mayfair,28 Sep,"Also, defunding doesn’t mean eliminating, but rather funding services for correct response and intervention. A good model is already around, look at suburban neighborhoods, that is what it means. Obviously no one wants the police to just disappear, but training and support are key to a more equitable version of policing in America."
24,162759105,Norma Clark,• East Colfax,28 Sep,"Just coincidental, but has anybody thought that people are trying to drive home prices down"

1,148006000,Paul Ryan,• South Park Hill,13 May,I’m still learning from South Park hill. One more is Westerly Creek trail through Stapleton which will take you out to Sand Creek trail which you can ride across to connect with Platte River trail and go wherever from there.
2,148006000,Ann Mathews,• East Colfax,13 May,A bike path map has been published. I think I got mine at a bike shop or REI.
3,148006000,Janine Harris,• Mayfair,13 May,Download MTB Project.  It’s free and gives all trails-dirt and paved anywhere/any state.  Descriptions of trails with pictures too!
4,148006000,Becky Robinson,• South Park Hill,13 May,"I bike a lot on Montview/23rd/26th because they have large, safe feeling bike lanes. That said, I am trying to clock mileage and always sort of run out of places to go, so I'd love to hear others' suggestions!"
5,148006000,Katie Moriarty,• South Park Hill,13 May,Same!!!! I been riding over to Northfield too over 1-70 but traffic over there is kinda scary. You’ll have to let me know if you think of anything. I’m trying to figure out different loops. 😂
6,148006000,Todd Chalmers,• South Park Hill,13 May,"For an urban ride, I like to cut through City Park, then Cheesman and head on to Wash Park. If you follow the bike route streets there’s not much traffic."
7,148006000,Nick Holstein,• Hale,13 May,"A good resource is Strava's global heatmap.  It doesn't give you any info on the routes, other than their relative popularity with other cyclists/runners/etc.  But you can filter by activity..."
8,148006000,Katie Moriarty,• South Park Hill,13 May,Cool. I’ll check it out!
9,148006000,Lou Veritable,• Congress Park,49w,The Denver Bike Map is a good way to plot a route to the regional trails: https://www.denvergov.org/content/dam/denvergov/Portals/708/documents/2017-Denver-Bike-Map.pdf
10,148006000,Barbara and Steve Krause,• Hale,14 May,"From Hale I ride South zig-zag to Forest southbound to cross Alameda at a wide intersection and then Leetsdale at a light to get to Cherry Creek Trail (CCT) right at 4 Mile Park. Then you can turn East and go to Cherry Creek Park and beyond, or turn off of CCT to NE or SW on HighLine Canal Trail. Or turn West on CCT and head for downtown and the Platte River Trail"
11,148006000,Doug Schuler,• North Park Hill,15 May,"Cycleton sells a map Bicycling the Greater Metro Area. It is up to date has all of the trails, bike lanes, bike routes from Brookfield to Highland Ranch"
12,148006000,Doug Schuler,• North Park Hill,15 May,"Becky find your way to Sand Creek and Dahlia. Actual Dahlia is a good route. It’s closed to vehicle traffic but bikes can get through. Take Dahlia north to the traffic light at Sand Creek. At the light right turn across bridge, right turn immediate right turn to bike path.  Take a right on the bike path and your on your way to the Platte bike path. When you get to the path right goes down town left goes to Golden or Brighton. Have fun"
13,148006000,Lou Veritable,• Congress Park,19 May,"So, Dahlia is open for cyclist from Smith Road to 48th (under I70)?"
14,148006000,Erik Peterson,• Mayfair,15 May,"Straight down 12th past cheeseman and you hit cherry creek trail, then go up past rei to 14th (I think) which curves into 29th.  Nice little ride!"
15,148006000,Erik Peterson,• Mayfair,15 May,Sand creek is good too but a little sketchy in parts
16,148006000,Emily Volkert,• Congress Park,16 May,What do you mean by sketchy?
17,148006000,Karen White,• Congress Park,16 May,"1)  Start in highlands anywhere and take 32nd to Golden.  If you still have a lot of ride in you, you can continue up all or part of Look Out Mountain.  "
18,148006000,Jacqueline Altreuter,• Congress Park,16 May,Use Bike Streets Denver’s map. They lay out the best routes which are not necessarily the routes that bunch everyone together onto the same ‘designated’ path. Much more pleasant. https://www.bikestreets.com/get-the-map
19,148006000,Nick Fuller,• Mayfair,48w,"Not 13th or 14th. They don't have bike paths.  There are roads right next to them that do, yet these cyclist choose to ride in the middle of the road.  Causing dangerous situations.  Honest whats the point of spending millions in taxes on bike lanes, when they ride in the middle of the road anyways.(edited)"

1,182828858,Tanya Field,• Gateway,8 Apr,Talk to your neighbors in case he got stuck in someone’s garage or yard. Post on pawboost.com as well as petharbor.com. Cats are more active at night so walk around outside then calling his name.

3,150647972,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,5 Jun,Poor thing. If his owner passed away we would be willing to adopt. One of our dogs was in just that situation and we adopted her immediately. Poor thing was homeless and scared. The original owner died and nobody helped the dog.

5,145029783,Peter M.,• Baker,17 Apr 20,"I agree.  It is good to remember that the Governor is responsible for the entire state, which is very diverse.  There is also no doubt that he was well aware of Mayor Hancock's plans, for what is by far the largest most populated part of CO.

13,145029783,Laura Gee,• Tava Waters,17 Apr 20,"Although I expected on my own to keep distancing through the end of the month, I don't appreciate the mayor thinking he knows better than the governor and saying he would determine dates on his own.

14,145029783,"Mayor's Office, Director of Strategic Communications Theresa Marchetta",• City of Denver,17 Apr 20,"Thanks for sharing your opinion, Laura. I'm not sure that it is based in fact, though. I don't think anyone is under the illusion that requiring businesses to close or people to stay at home puts money in anyone's ""coffers"", to say nothing of the tax base we rely on to fund important city services. The Mayor makes decisions based on science and health data- in coordination with the Governor, who by the way, understands that Denver is a densely populated city- where cases/contact/transmission are a greater risk. The Mayor and Governor Polis talk regularly- and the Governor has confidence Mayor Hancock will do what's best for the city he's responsible for protecting. The Governor must make broader decisions for the entire state. We are always coordinating and communicating, and fortunately for all of us, it has worked to our advantage as a state responding with our very best efforts during this unprecedented pandemic."

21,145029783,Gaar Potter,• Happy Canyon,17 Apr 20,What alternative is horrible? I think shutting down the economy and 20 million unemployed is darned horrible!
22,145029783,David Petersen,• Cherry Creek North,17 Apr 20,"I don't see why we can't extend it till late May for example. Denver along with other cities don't have enough testing kits and other resources to handle the continued cases. I see it actually getting worse once people go about socializing and not wearing masks. Only about 10% of people in my neighborhood wear masks and most are senior citizens...it's baffling.  A lot of people are not taking this seriously enough until it actually affects them or their family/friends. Too many people (perhaps 10% or more of the population) are walking around asymptomatic, infecting people around them."

24,145029783,Dick Nickoloff,• Southmoor Park South,17 Apr 20,"For once I can agree with Mayor Hancock and Gov. Poliis's way of handling this Quarantine. The issue in Michigan is the strict lockdown covered the entire state when the big issue is SE Michigan and primarily Detroit, (Which by the way wasn't the site of the protest, but it was in Lansing!) Denver unfortunately is very vulnerable thus tighter controls. We are lucky to live mostly in SE Denver, but other parts of this city have some serious issues."

Is it your right to do what you want to do at cost and safety of others ?  I can’t help think that putting your self and others at risk is worth it . Even if the city opens businesses  what is the benefit if that means we have to start social distancing all over again  .
27,145029783,Sara J.,• Harvey Park,17 Apr 20,"I believe people are growing increasingly concerned with the fact that losing their homes is becoming a very real possibility. Many people in our city live paycheck to paycheck and not being able to work is having devastating consequences for them. It's not about wanting to ""show the government"". It's about fear of being able to provide for their families."
28,145029783,Mary M.,• Fort Logan,17 Apr 20,Sara I understand what your saying I to am barely hanging on but I’d rather stick out a little bit longer than to get sick and have no way to recover because I’m sick and can’t get back to work .  To me losing everything is losing a family member .

Stop saying young people aren’t worth a test when I have one friend age 30 who died and a second who was in the ICU age 32 for an entire month and was just released yesterday. Neither had preexisting health issues. Yet several of my demographic have shown symptoms and have been denied testing. How can we go on with our daily lives without knowing if we had it or not?? I speaking of current tests while showing symptoms and antibody testing. If airlines can test passengers and get results within 15 minutes so can we. GET TESTS SO WE CAN REOPEN OUR ECONOMY AND ISOLATE INFECTED PERSONS AND AREAS. Why is the government incapable of doing anything. Just get it done! People are suffering medically and financially.

0,159428812,Paul Brown,• South Park Hill,27 Aug,No one should ever read the Glendale Cherry Creek Chronicle. Its garbage and not worth the paper it's paper it's printed on. If I wanted to listen to the ramblings of a bunch of old white Trump supporters I'd move to Nebraska.
1,159428812,Victoria Inman,• Congress Park,27 Aug,It's total trash. Although I do peruse for a good laugh or five.
2,159428812,Paul Brown,• South Park Hill,34w,Here's a quote from the publisher on his radio show:
3,159428812,John Bachman,• South Park Hill,27 Aug,Looks like Glendale Chronicle is being cancelled.
4,159428812,Paul Brown,• South Park Hill,27 Aug,"Yes, I'm under the crazy notion that a person who advocates for school shootings should not be given a platform."
5,159428812,Bridget Walsh,• South Park Hill,27 Aug,"The CCC is a real mixed bag. They have published many articles ghost written by known progressive journalists and community members. They back some of Denver progressive Candi CdeBaca's proposals or at least give them air time and giver credit for representing the interests of her constiuents and not the Hancock gang . And more. On the other hand, they have also aired the views of the far right and featured , for  example, articles by Denise Riech, the Real estate agent who was recently seen taking Black Lives Matters signs off of yards. I read it because I always want to know what the other side is thinking and doing and I appreciate their effort to bring otherwise ignored community opinions to the fore."
6,159428812,John Sawyer,• South Park Hill,27 Aug,Yeah who would want to read an article with actual facts and source citations supporting a trend that just happens to run counter to the prevailing narrative.
7,159428812,Paul Brown,• South Park Hill,27 Aug,Let's turn that around...who would care to read ANYTHING in a newspaper whose publisher hoped for a school shooting to distract from Trump's impeachment?
8,159428812,John Bachman,• South Park Hill,34w,"Paul, it looks like you've also cancelled people from the state of Nebraska? Their opinions also not valid?(edited)"
9,159428812,Dana Arvin,• South Park Hill,27 Aug,"This site has the specific purpose of addressing group living.  I thought we were going to be adults and keep our politics to ourselves. Cuz guess what, no one really cares about anyones politics, we all understand both sides already."
10,159428812,Doug Bohm,• Congress Park,27 Aug,What about the ones that support the group living proposals? See what you did there?
11,159428812,Judy Werner,• Hale,27 Aug,"You are so right on, Paul.  Amanda Sawyer, the city Council person that we the people elected into office is there to serve the developers and she knows what she is doing.  The voters did not ask for rezoning, the developers did and Amanda is there to serve them.  I hope we get to vote on the rezoning as our City Council Rep is not doing what is in our best interest."
12,159428812,Joyce Cerretti,• Congress Park,27 Aug,"Actually, members like CdeBaca want to cancel suburbia like other big cities by integrating group housing."
13,159428812,Jessie Hardy,• Hale,27 Aug,I hate that magazine. It’s horribly pejorative and skewed
14,159428812,Joyce Cerretti,• Congress Park,27 Aug,"Roger, guess everyone's a racist that disagrees."
15,159428812,Jessie Hardy,• Hale,27 Aug,That’s a logical fallacy what you did there.
16,159428812,Joyce Cerretti,• Congress Park,28 Aug,Jessie Hardy my point exactly.
17,159428812,Judy Werner,• Hale,28 Aug,No rezoning for Sawyer and CdBaca.
18,159428812,Dana Arvin,• South Park Hill,28 Aug,"I think this is a web of issues.  A year ago, CC denied the renewal of contracts for the halfway houses/treatment facilities in the community corrections space.  Ms. C'deBaca said the companies were not acceptable because their parent companies contract with the federal government at the boarder.  You all know the narrative on the boarder issue. From what I can see, the issues are not resolved and CC is looking for alternatives.  This failure to renew those contracts and failure to come up with alternatives, so far, with multiply the homeless population as well as add to the narrative that there isn't enough inexpensive housing.  These are issues that CC has created to open the door to begin the march, with the YIMBYs to make Denver like Portland.  This Group Living issue is just the first of many attempts to destroy our City."
19,159428812,Stephen Eppler,• Congress Park,34w,There are other problems.
20,159428812,Kim Erickson,• South Park Hill,28 Aug,Don’t like the racist paper or the racist idea limiting access to affordable homes
21,159428812,Gail Schultz,• Central Park,29 Aug,A decrease of 30/month is not a burst.
22,159428812,Alex Neth,• Skyland,1 Sep,"While I do enjoy crackin' open the old Nextdoor to read a bunch of people mindlessly repeating the word ""canceled,"" like it means anything in this context besides pro-Trump signaling, the fact of that paper's worthlessness is well established. "
23,159428812,Janet Meredith,• North Park Hill,5 Sep,There were serious issues with the for-profit halfway houses and community corrections facilities. The solutions are not easy but are important. This is about people’s lives. So is the issue of homelessness- which is complex and getting mush worse with recent job losses. Ms C de Baca is impressive- she is looking for better solutions and she respects the people she serves.
24,159428812,Stephen Eppler,• Congress Park,33w,The Denver Planning Board passed the Group Living Amendment 9-0 moving it forward in the political process..

1,165234334,Sara Goodall,• North Park Hill,21 Oct,"Jessica Warren and Kenneth Brobst I believe next door guidelines actually are to not discuss national politics so I won’t respond with my thoughts on setting our country back. But honestly if you don’t have something kind to say then maybe just don’t say anything, and definitely don’t reply with a snarky jab. I intentionally didn’t post anything about their politics just the sign information so that I stayed within guidelines. Thank you."
2,165234334,Meg Garrido,• South Park Hill,21 Oct,"I would love to take one. Thank you for offering them.  Biden/Harris ticket is our only chance out of this nightmare of the last 4 years. I don’t get the previous comments. We’ve already been painfully set back under the current administration in every aspect - health, human rights and social justice, environment, national unity, international relations, etc. Finally an opportunity to move forward.  I’ll pm you about the signs."
3,165234334,Kenneth Brobst,• North Park Hill,21 Oct,"If this app is supposedly politics free, so we can be good neighbors, then please peddle your political party endorsements and signs and buttons on a different app, and not assume your neighbors think as you do.  Appreciate the consideration."

I don’t assume everyone thinks as I do, just hope that we all act with respect.

10,142613572,Adam Cauble,• East Colfax,1y,Catherine could you leave a note at the location? I am worried you just stole someone’s dog so it would be good to at least write your phone number on paper and put it partially under that same rock so the person knows how to contact you to get their dog back.

0,158388275,Molly Jaques,• Central Park,17 Aug,My son had his back bike with red lettering stolen from Target last week. I can get you a better description from him when i get home.

2,158388275,Marcia Fulton,• Central Park,17 Aug,"Ha - got it.  Unfortunately, that is not the bike I have - I will let you know if it comes up as others are perhaps found."
3,158388275,Debbie Gehring-timberman,• Montbello,17 Aug,"Just be on a watch out for a truck that looks like it is picking up junk, but has bikes in it. It is a dark color and I only see every now and again . This is happening in the Montebello area."
4,158388275,Andrea Roberts-Buckett,• Central Park,17 Aug,Was your bike more expensive than the one it was swapped with? We had this happen to us several years ago and our bike (which was worth more than the 2 left in our alley in its place) was taken straight to a pawn shop (our neighbor tracked it down!) Fingers crossed for you.
5,158388275,Rose Barela,• Montbello,17 Aug,My son bike was stolen from Walmart neighbored it’s red

9,158388275,Christina Young,• North Park Hill,19 Aug,I had my black Schwinn hybrid mountain/road bike stolen about a month ago. It has red lettering and a hitch on the back for a tag-along kid bike. If anyone has seen it I’d love it back.
10,158388275,Marcia Fulton,• Central Park,19 Aug,"Have you called 720-913-2000 (hit zero) and asked?  If you have a serial number, that is helpful."
11,158388275,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,22 Aug,Look for the posting on ND from Liz LaRue. She’s stating that next to her house are  lots of bikes that appear stolen. I think 38th and Poplar/Potomac.  She can’t get DP to do anything about it.  They arrested someone selling used needles today.
0,151698104,Rachelle Washington,• Central Park,14 Jun,The name Stapleton is part of racism. It needs to go.
1,151698104,Chris Nelson,• Central Park,14 Jun,"How many American Indian street names, mascots, etc. that need to be changed first?"
2,151698104,Darin Wentz,• Hoffman Heights,14 Jun,Hold on a minute I miss something please enlighten me how is Stapleton a racist word explain please
3,151698104,Aman Ellis,• East Colfax,14 Jun,Stapleton is named after Mayor Stapleton who was in the KKK.
4,151698104,Chris Nelson,• Central Park,14 Jun,"Jude Wolf here’s what we can do in our city. A majority of the families in Montbello lost their jobs due to covid. Many of these families don’t know where their next meal is coming from. So let’s take the money they are spending on this name change and donate it to that cause. These folks are our neighbors, friends, etc. 👍"
5,151698104,Aj Stack,• Central Park,14 Jun,I would rather do this! To change the name just pushes money around through bureaucratic channels. Why can’t the money go directly to the people that need it?
6,151698104,Stephen Cochrane,• Central Park,14 Jun,"The root of the problem is we as home owners are losing our right to vote in the name of acceptance, as a homeowner in this association we are permitted a vote and that’s being taken away it seems, and that’s the real problem"
7,151698104,Cynthia Ivers,• Lowry,14 Jun,"How can the HOA get around the governing documents? It requires a super majority for the name change. If they want to change the procedure of naming, a simple majority (I believe) of the owners is required. Either way, a vote is required."
8,151698104,Chris Nelson,• Central Park,14 Jun,Yes I agree! Please send me my ballot so that I can vote NO!
9,151698104,Rachelle Washington,• Central Park,15 Jun,Is that a no not to change the name.
10,151698104,Jon Krauss,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,15 Jun,I agree make substance changes instead of spending your capital on this.
11,151698104,Don Troike,• Central Park,14 Jun,"If NASCAR can ban confederate flags, the military change the name of its bases, and southern states pull down confederate monuments, we can change a name that similarly symbolizes the KKK's acts of terror. I voted no last time; I will vote for a new name this time."
12,151698104,Chris Nelson,• Central Park,14 Jun,"Aman Ellis There are military bases named after Confederate Generals, statues that honor them, states that still fly the flag. There are even words and phrases that we all use daily that are racist. It just doesn’t stop after you take the name Stapleton off of things."
13,151698104,Keegan Perkins,• Central Park,14 Jun,"It doesn’t symbolize that though. You’re not even from here apparently. I don’t think anyone around here was going to Stapleton Airport trembling in fear, or upset about the name. It meant jobs for many."
14,151698104,Dennis Campbell,• Central Park,14 Jun,"Truth is we folded to a threat from a non-Stapleton resident and liberal pressure.  Apparently our residential votes dont count, as we have been thru this several times."
15,151698104,Chris Nelson,• Central Park,14 Jun,"Dennis Campbell thanks! I just don’t see how this is going to solve anything? Like I said previously, if this name change is someone’s civil rights moment then we are missing the boat here. Systemic racism is the real issue here, not some dumb name that nobody cares about."
16,151698104,Jessica Bonelli,• Central Park,14 Jun,"Maybe someone can help me with something I have been wondering about. If all these symbols, people and statues are offensive and I could see how there are, how is it that the black community tolerates very offensive language by black rap artists? You know which word I am referring to. It is confusing to me. Thanks!"
17,151698104,Cynthia Ivers,• Lowry,14 Jun,Good point.
18,151698104,Jessica Bonelli,• Central Park,14 Jun,"Chris Nelson- understood, I just think that if not everyone tolerates it that we would hear about more push back from the black community?  I think it can be confusing to those of us who are white. Maybe black leaders and celebrities should denounce it, because it IS offensive."
19,151698104,Chris Nelson,• Central Park,14 Jun,"Jessica Bonelli - I understand that, but there are MUCH bigger issues than music. You can turn music off, systemic racism is Ingrained in the very fabric of American life. "
20,151698104,Jessica Bonelli,• Central Park,14 Jun,Chris Nelson I really appreciate your points and yes there are much bigger problems.
21,151698104,Jo Will,• Montbello,14 Jun,What a waste!
22,151698104,Garrett W.,• Beeler Park,14 Jun,"Growing up in Denver, Daddy Bruce Randolph did so much for the community of Northern Denver. Make the neighborhood name change to someone with positive history in this area. Randolph Neighborhood. Just sayin’."
23,151698104,Jeanette Baust,• East Colfax,15 Jun,Good idea. There are plenty of really good people to celebrate if it has a person's name.
24,151698104,Gerald Tafoya,• Central Park,17 Jun,"No, it should not reflect any one person! That’s why we are in discussing this now! Centralization and most ppl seem to use Central Park and there is a road named Central Park."
25,151698104,Jasmine Naranjo,• Beeler Park,14 Jun,Didn’t they do a vote about the name change last year and it was voted by the people that live in Stapleton to keep the name? 🤔
26,151698104,Cynthia Ivers,• Lowry,14 Jun,"Yep.Apparently, there is going to be another vote."
27,151698104,Darin Wentz,• Hoffman Heights,15 Jun,Jessica you took the words out of my mouth certainly you can turn music off but not before the kids hear it and start singing along with it
28,151698104,Chris Nelson,• Central Park,15 Jun,Darin Wentz - Let me get this straight: if we get rid of Rap then the police will stop killing unarmed black men and systemic racism disappears? Fair enough 🤦‍♂️
29,151698104,Kaytee Cowperthwaite,• Hoffman Heights,15 Jun,Changing Stapleton’s name won’t stop the killing of unarmed black folk either...
30,151698104,Veronica Barahona - Ziegler,• Central Park,15 Jun,We will name it Cherry Blossom and when they ask where is cherry blossom we will say in stapleton 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
31,151698104,Jon Krauss,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,15 Jun,Getting rid of. This Nextdoor app will solve even more problems.
32,151698104,Clifford Jackson,• Montbello,15 Jun,I like this app. I've bought and sold things on it. I get updates of what's going on in my neighborhood. Nothing wrong with the app.

Not sure if it was yours ; however I know the cats around my house and across the alley to the houses on Geneva and this was a stranger. Hope you find him. 🙏.  Hate to say that in a little over a year 2 cats disappeared, 4 cats died from unknown illness, and another 3 legged was killed somehow. 5 of those lived on Geneva and 2 loved at my house. Prayers."

3,159248671,Pat M.,• Ryan Ranch,25 Aug,I understand it's your landlord's responsibility but filters aren't expensive and it's your health that's at risk.
4,159248671,Cristiane P.,• Englewood Area 3,25 Aug,Thank you! We just move to the area and on my last house (in Florida) we changed it every single month. Here the maintenance guy said they change 2x a year. I was like 😮. We ask them to come and check (so I could see where it is located) and for sure now I’ll change more frequently because we’re the ones breathing it.
5,159248671,"Steve Staeger, 9NEWS",,25 Aug,I had a furnace guy tell me to do it once a month to make life easier on the furnace.
6,159248671,Tyson Tieperman,• Hampden Heights East,34w,"This is why some landlords are known as slime-balls vultures.  I don't think every month is needed (if it is you have other issues causing this that need to be fixed) but twice a year is what i do, between seasons.  every quarter isn't bad either, i just found with my set up twice is year is fine, my filter isn't even that dirty after 6 months.  Also a pro tip, DO NOT buy the most expensive strongest filters, it makes your unit work extra hard.  I buy the mid grade, red package Filtrete.(edited)"

Stapleton requires personal trash bins to be stored out of sight, which forces alot of residents to have to store them in their garage. It is so smelly even with lid shut. When in Stapleton, use the public dog waste trash cans. Every other block.(edited)"
15,154989844,Jim Paige,• Lowry,16 Jul,I completely agree. Nothing worse than putting out your trash bins in the morning then bringing them in after work and then finding out the next day but your garage stinks like dog poop. Especially when I don’t have a dog
16,154989844,Dani Truesdale,• Hoffman Heights,16 Jul,"Long Do has every right to not want another person's dog's poop in his trash can, especially if he's paying for the service. personally, I would prefer someone to take their dog poop with them, but if my trash bins are out, I'd rather a person throw the poop bag in my trash cans instead of throwing it on the sidewalk, yard or street."
17,154989844,Michelle Ku,• Lowry,16 Jul,"I can't believe that people cannot understand that non-pet owners don't want other people's pet's crap in their garbage.   Cans are supposed to be kept in your garage in Lowry & Stapleton and they sure do stink in this heat, even with the lids closed.  People without pets don't have them because they don't want to deal with their waste, among other reasons.  Have some courtesy and keep the crap for your own cans."
18,154989844,Patricia Smith,• South Park Hill,16 Jul,"Agreed. Since this discussion thread is to all of the neighborhoods, some enjoy the privilege of community trash as they walk their dogs; others do not. 1) Pick up your dog's waste 2) dispose of it ideally in your own bin, or - 3) dispose of it in a park/community bin. The world over one sees people not doing this. Sure, it should be better. The whole point is to keep the waste off of the streets, away from parks where people congregate and it's a health issue, and IDEALLY, out of private trash bins. 'Nuff said."

21,154989844,Jessica Heinzen,• Central Park,16 Jul,We are required to keep the trash cans in our garage in Stapleton. Not everyone has a side yard to keep their trash can and the HOA has a panic attack if the trash can is left outside. So dog poop for an entire week in a hot garage in 100 degree heat is not exactly the best smelling situation. Especially when it starts to make your car stink and seeps inside your house. Eww.

1,160123152,John Hutchison,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,2 Sep,"I got a night owl system for 300 from Wal-Mart. 6 cameras, pretty easy to install. Has a free app to Monitor on smartphone"

4,160123152,John Hutchison,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,2 Sep,This is the one i bought
5,160123152,Alec Hogan,• Del Mar North,2 Sep,"I use a Safevant system. 175$ for 4 cameras and a box capable of 8 cameras. 120$ for hard drive. I purchased another 175$ kit for the 4 additional cameras and have all 8 setup currently. Easy to use app on phone and with the harddrive I purchased my system records 24/7 on all 8 cameras for the previous month. All wireless internet cameras with the option to hardwire to ethernet. The customer service helped me set whole system up in 45 minutes. Which included setting specific cameras to motion detection notification, only during specific hours of the day/night. Each camera does have to have it's own power outlet to work. So me personally had to add some extra hidden outlets. But could easily have still setup system without doing so. I am overall extremely satisfied with the safevant brand and picture quality. Also, additional features that can be bought are speakers so you can talk through the app on phone and also sirens so you can set off a loud sound to scare off anyone who shouldnt be lurking around. I've only been in the neighborhood for about 2 years and I've had the aurora homicide unit reach out to me twice now for specific vehicles involved in shootings. Any questions just PM me and I can answer to the best of my knowledge!"
6,160123152,Chuck H L.,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,2 Sep,Where can I order one from?
7,160123152,Alec Hogan,• Del Mar North,2 Sep,Chuck H Longoira Amazon is where I purchased all my items. This is the setup I bought. Currently unavailable but there looks to be a 8 camera system available in stock. I still recommend a 4tb hard drive for lengthy video storage.

11,160123152,Zack Westlie,• East Colfax,3 Sep,"If you're looking for affordable options, wyze cams can be a good option. Just don't get the outdoor one, just get the regular wyze cam v2 and put it under an eve or just something to keep the rain from directly soaking it. I've had 4 of them and have been extremely happy. They're $25 each and only require a WiFi network and they come with a long power cord and magnetic mounting kit."

I haven’t gone crazy searching but I keep an eye out every time I have to go to the store and there has been none. I’m starting to get concerned at this point"
2,141678525,Rafael Lopez,• South Park Hill,24 Mar 20,"Well, medically you can die from alcohol withdrawal if you have alcoholism. I imagine the liquor store closures were rescinded to avoid the city having an influx of homeless folks into the ER for withdrawal symptoms."

5,141678525,Tony Salvo,• Central Park,1y,I'm curious to see if we have a spike in active COVID cases with the large amount of people gathering at the liquor stores last night.  Most stores had a 30+ minute wait to get in the doors.(edited)
6,141678525,Tree Wallace,• East Colfax,24 Mar 20,"no, they were on line about 6 feet apart!"
7,141678525,Sharon Tave,• North Park Hill,1y,I believe it is because a lot of people would go into withdrawals which in turn would overwhelm our healthcare systems.  The same with the the virus if a number of people needed hospitalization because of the spread of the virus it would deplete what little supplies they have now and overwhelm our facilities and be put in the same position as Italy.  We should have been ordered to shelter in place two weeks ago.(edited)
8,141678525,Tree Wallace,• East Colfax,24 Mar 20,"yes, i heard a nurse saying it was because of the alcohol withdrawals that would happen."

12,141678525,Jane Ritter,• South Park Hill,24 Mar 20,"So pathetic that people went so bonker nuts (to use a ""kinder phrase"") at the thought of not having their wine or weed.  Truly pathetic. Equally pathetic is Hancock caving that quickly to the pressure. For god's sake, if they are alcoholics or pot addicts (yes, people do get addicted to pot), just drive one town over (for now)."
13,141678525,Elaine Taniwaki,• South Park Hill,24 Mar 20,"I thought the very same.  I was returning from an errand in south Denver, driving back in to central Denver on northbound Logan.  Smooth sailing because there just aren't many cars on the road, until traffic came to a screeching halt at Louisiana Avenue.  Why?  The traffic was backed up waiting to get into the liquor store Logan & Mississippi.  Same story a mile and a-half further north, cars lined up to get to the liquor store on Bayaud."

1,139426729,Nancy Bruce,• Tava Waters,4 Mar 20,Thank you for the warning. I'll be careful knowing this now.
2,139426729,Catelyn Gonzales,• Del Mar Parkway,1y,I’m posting this on Facebook. Where is the Safeway located?(edited)
3,139426729,Karen K.,• Windsor Gardens East,4 Mar 20,Is this the Safeway in Lowery or on Havana ?
4,139426729,Jan H.,• Lowry,4 Mar 20,This is the Lowry Safeway at 200 Quebec St
5,139426729,Kittie Hook,• Lowry,4 Mar 20,Can you give more details on her description?
6,139426729,Susan Puccio,• Central Park,4 Mar 20,"well, what about the kid?!"
7,139426729,Karen Garvey,• Central Park,4 Mar 20,"Yes! if she's known to police, what are they doing to make sure the child is safe?"
8,139426729,Denise Williams,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,4 Mar 20,They have been banned from the Wendys on Ulster as well. The woman is verbally aggressive and the boy is physically aggressive punching a random customer about 5 years old in the face. I was hoping after that incident the police would have at least found help for the boy
9,139426729,Amy Bryer,• Lowry,4 Mar 20,Thank you Jan. She approached my car last week as I was leaving and gave me the double “bird” when I shook my head “No.” I worry about her young son. This is not the first time I have read about the two of them  on Nextdoor. The little boy appears to be very young school age if not preschool. She was pulling the gray hoodie up around her head as she approached my car but I don’t have much other description.
10,139426729,Jan H.,• Lowry,4 Mar 20,"Adam I re-read that whole thread, and there are alot of similarities and in fact, it might very well be the same woman and child."
11,139426729,Gretchen Koehler,• Mayfair,4 Mar 20,Thanks for the heads up!!!
12,139426729,Kathryn Studer,• Lowry,1y,"Fyi, when adults are panhandling with whom are assumed to be their children, social services should be called. I am a teacher and was recently made aware that this is considered a mandatory reporting situation. I have not seen this person but if you are a teacher, doctor, etc you must call social services and report. I would think the police reported this to social services but not sure. Clearly, not an appropriate adult to be taking care of a child.(edited)"
13,139426729,Jamie Tenace Tenace,• Lowry,4 Mar 20,Is she African American?   I’m just wondering if this is her w her 7 year old son   He looks that age   If so I have a bad story about her
14,139426729,Christa Osman,• Central Park,5 Mar 20,Yes this is the same woman everybody  ecounters in Lowry town center.
15,139426729,Debra Persico,• Windsor North,4 Mar 20,"She just flipped me the bird in the Safeway parking lot about 30 minutes ago because I told her no! She comes right up to your car door  (I had just parked) so beware when you are getting out of it. Agitated enough,  she may try to grab your purse if you are not careful.  The young boy was with her today too. Thanks for the heads up on Social Services."
16,139426729,Jan H.,• Lowry,4 Mar 20,"Jose- Not sure who you are directing your comments to, but this thread is intended as a notification of an unsafe situation. "
17,139426729,Jose Contreras,• Lowry,4 Mar 20,"Were you physically assaulted or harmed by them? If not, ignore them. You did the right thing if you think they were going to assault you, but if they didn't and all they did was make you upset, they're probably not breaking the law or going to harm anyone."
18,139426729,Kirk Wayland,• Mayfair,1y,"I’m tired of hearing the “Denver is expensive” excuse for bad behavior. Be a good person and most of the time you’ll get what you give. Socioeconomic status doesn’t entitle anyone to threaten and intimidate the community around them, rich or poor. Just reading through all these posts, she is clearly a nuisance. A welfare check on the kid needs to happen. I appreciate being made aware.(edited)"
19,139426729,Kathy Shaw,• Central Park,4 Mar 20,"Based on the description there is more going on than just bad behavior. It sounds like she has a mental illness, addiction, or possibly both. Definitely needs intervention from professional people and the DPD.  Especially the child - Child Protective Services needs to be contacted."
20,139426729,Beth Mullin,• East Colfax,4 Mar 20,Ridiculous. What the heck. Why don’t the police do something? Their non enforcement just leads to more problems.
21,139426729,Sadie Martin,• East Colfax,5 Mar 20,Because according to an officer at District 2 they “have bigger things to worry about like prostitution and drugs.” They don’t care 🤷🏻‍♀️
22,139426729,Karen K.,• Windsor Gardens East,5 Mar 20,Also I think it’s Hancock’s position to let the homeless exsist and the rest of us can just put up with it. He doesn’t want to be seen as not welcoming to the homeless.
23,139426729,Carol Summerlin,• Windsor Gardens East,5 Mar 20,"Kathy Shaw, you’ve got it right. Jose Contreras, your comments aren’t helpful. Your reply is ignorant."
24,139426729,Christa Osman,• Central Park,5 Mar 20,Agreed
25,139426729,Michael Myers,• Windsor Gardens East,5 Mar 20,Which Safeway? I live about half-way between 2 of them.

27,139426729,Kathryn Studer,• Lowry,5 Mar 20,"As a man, Jose, do not assume what is threatening for a woman."
28,139426729,Emily May,• Mir Park,5 Mar 20,"Thank you, Kathryn!"
29,139426729,Emily May,• Mir Park,1y,"Sad situation, especially the boy’s.  Continual exposure to his mother’s behavior - regardless of her diagnosis - will have far reaching effects for the rest of his life.  His age group is vulnerable to traumatic neuro damage from the abuse. The police are not using good judgment.  Law enforcement officers whose work includes contact with children need additional training/degrees for the above reasons.  Their involvement could make a big difference in the boy’s life outcome.(edited)"

4,177992033,Marc House,• Central Park,22 Feb,one week ago on the 15th.
5,177992033,Cameron Coles,• Central Park,22 Feb,I live two blocks from you and my security camera picked up this cat Feb 18 at 2:39am. Is this Blaster? https://video.nest.com/clip/7e92ea615d304b76a74ee838986f80a9.mp4
6,177992033,Marc House,• Central Park,22 Feb,"Thank you so much for sharing! However,  the leg looks white (unless its snow) and he is all gray except the chest and chin."
7,177992033,Sandy Caron,• Central Park,22 Feb,"Not sure how far you moved from, but if it’s within the city you might check your former home.  Years ago when I moved from Cherry Creek to Congress Park my cat went missing. She had found her way back to our old house."
8,177992033,Marc House,• Central Park,22 Feb,I have been checking every day before and after work and the new owners are watching for him.  The two home are only 4.5 miles apart. Thank you!
9,177992033,Cherie Monlezun,• Central Park,22 Feb,"Aaahhhhhhh, I saw him today!!! I live on 26th avenue, between Ironton and Joliet. He came right up to me and I loved on him for about 15 minutes. He's seriously the sweetest! I'll begin actively looking for him!"
10,177992033,Marc House,• Central Park,22 Feb,Oh great! I'll head out there now!
11,177992033,Cherie Monlezun,• Central Park,22 Feb,Yay! Good luck... He's such a great guy! I'll keep looking too...I know he'll make his way back to y'all!
12,177992033,Judy Baxter,• Historic Montclair,22 Feb,Check your old neighborhood/home as well.  Cats can find their way back to their old home over weeks and months.

17,177992033,Jacob Fritz,• East Colfax,23 Feb,I lost my cat Diego recently during a move. I just kept going back to the place where he jumped out of my window. I left his bed and food and coordinated with the neighborhood. He was spotted several times. After 10 days I got him back. 😍🙂 keep hope and keep trying
18,177992033,Justin Grace,• Central Park,8w,"My boyfriend went out at 3am and after 5 days of searching, we spotted our cat in some brush/was meowing super quick. We tried all times of days, but night (7pm-2am) still seemed to have enough noise. Thinking of you!(edited)"
19,177992033,Marc House,• Central Park,23 Feb,"Thanks so much!  I will keep searching the area and try to do it later at night.  I know the suggestions online were for after midnight too.  He does come when you call his name normally, but not when hes stressed probably."

1,155782145,Giovanna Lares,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Jul,I’ve had them since December would it work?
2,155782145,Amy Webb,• Morris Heights,23 Jul,"Giovanna Lares yes! Use every day for a few weeks and they will start disappearing. They even work on scars that are years old, just takes longer to see results.  I think they sell it at CVS/walgreens and on Amazon."
3,155782145,Giovanna Lares,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Jul,"Thank you, just might try it!"
4,155782145,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,23 Jul,"They will fade by themselves. December was not that long ago. I had some surgery on my wrist and I had this big red slash that I was very self-conscious about but it's almost invisible now. It takes a while until you think it's going to look like that forever, and then it just kind of fades away. Maybe some of the suggestions will work and make it go away faster. Otherwise, time and patience will do it, too."

9,155782145,Jan H.,• Lowry,24 Jul,Yes Mederma does work quite well.
10,155782145,Jenny Rice,• Lowry,23 Jul,Plastic surgeons say silicone strips are really the only proven thing that works. I used them after my c section and on my neck and it did take time but definitely worked! You can get them on amazon.
11,155782145,Kelsie Geyer,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Jul,"Look for all natural Vitamin C serum, with retinol and hyaluronic acid. Also, you can check out Zero Market at any of their locations and ask them to make you a ""anti-scar"" serum. They use fantastic, all organic and natural oils."
12,155782145,Kelsie Geyer,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,23 Jul,"As a side note, my understanding is that baking soda will be very harsh to use on the skin and may cause irritation."
13,155782145,Monica Rose,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,23 Jul,"I've heard that Clarins Double Serum works wonders, but it is NOT safe if you have a latex allergy!"
14,155782145,Chelsea Lavelle,• Aurora,24 Jul,I’ve had a scar since January and use Bio-oil + these and it’s fading.
15,155782145,Janelle Miller,• Aurora,24 Jul,Apparently you can get those silicone strips at Walmart- cheaper then Amazon....
16,155782145,Libra Gray,• Montbello,24 Jul,"Whatever you use, I’d recommend wearing sunscreen during the day. I’ve seen good results with a retinol but without sunscreen they actually come back darker!"
17,155782145,Libra Gray,• Montbello,39w,"ProActive acne kit works too.  Sheds the old skin off but you have to be patient dealing with the peeling skin....again, sunscreen is an absolute must!(edited)"
18,155782145,Jan H.,• Lowry,24 Jul,"Libra, you make an important point. Scars do need more protection from the sun, with sunscreen and if on your face, wear a hat with a brim also. "
19,155782145,Abby Zimmerman,• Central Park,25 Jul,Vitamin e gel capsules. Get them from any store and pierce the capsule itself with a pin/needle. Then rub the gel directly on the scar daily. It will take some time but I’ve seen great results on my own skin
20,155782145,Marian Kerner,• Montbello,27 Jul,"What's the source of the scars? Are these keloid scars? If so, your doctor can inject them with steroid to kill the keloiding. Get some roll on ScarAway and use it twice a day. I tell you this because I had severe surgery on my face for skin cancer last Nov. I now have very smooth area."

20,154665011,Cornelia Maes,• Windsor Gardens East,13 Jul,"If the cat was poisoned, that is a cowardly selfish act.

Sorry about your pet."

0,159191877,Alisa Wilson,• Central Park,24 Aug,Congrats on the kittty! One thing you can do is just put him in the litter box a lot that will reinforce it in his head. Unfortunately they do have accidents.  There is an orange spray you can by which will make the area unappealing to them to go in the same spot. Also just get a carpet cleaner for pets and spray it. It will clean up the carpet well. I have 3 cats and a dog.
1,159191877,Nathalie Landeau,• Central Park,24 Aug,"Clean the spot ( and any future spots) with an enzymatic cleaner, like Nature’s Miracle.  You can get it at Petsmart or Petco or order it through chewycom. It is important that it is an enzymatic cleaner so they no longer can smell the spot where they had the prior issue.  If it continues to happen you may want to have the kitten checked by a vet but occasional accidents when they are this young do occur."
2,159191877,Kay Mydosh,• Central Park,25 Aug,Wow thank you for such a detailed and thoughtful response!  I’ll be getting some enzymatic cleaner today. He is so sweet and I just want to give him the best life possible. I also really like the two litter box suggestion! Thank you!
3,159191877,Kristin Baird,• South Park Hill,25 Aug,Kay Mydosh definitely keep the box clean. I scoop mine 2-3 times daily. It sounds like he is just a little scared and overwhelmed- he’ll be out and about in no time! Good luck!
4,159191877,Tas Frashure,• South Park Hill,24 Aug,Nature’s Miracle is just that. It neutralizes the area where he went and so it won’t be a repeat area for him. Congrats on your kitty!
5,159191877,Lisa Kelley,• East Colfax,24 Aug,"Feliway at petsmart is a pheromone diffuser that gives off a calm odor.  Also,  my kitties love ""fleece"" throw blankets.  Walmart has them.  They knead them and purr like it's their mama's tummy."
6,159191877,Diane Whitcomb,• Locust St,24 Aug,"It takes a while for cats to adjust to a new space.  Let him come out from under the bed at his own pace. Don’t rush him, but make sure to give him lots of positive reinforcement when he does.  Keep the box in the room for a few days m, so if his anxiety level is high, he can still get there without additional stress."
7,159191877,Kay Mydosh,• Central Park,25 Aug,Luckily my school and my work is all remote for this year so I will be able to give him a ton of attention all day every day. Thank you for the advice!
8,159191877,Cynthia Ivers,• Lowry,34w,Natures Miracle or Oxiclean with Orange will do the trick. This is Normal for kittens to have accidents.(edited)
9,159191877,Kay Mydosh,• Central Park,25 Aug,Thank you so much for all the amazing suggestions everyone!! I really appreciate it and I’m going to buy some natures miracle this morning!
10,159191877,Liz LaRue,• Northeast Park Hill,25 Aug,"I have a Bengal male who refuses to pee and poo in the same litter box, so I have 2. You may want to try that just in case. Furthermore, he likes the litter box to be cleaned a couple times a day. If I am remiss in my duties, he will poo literally right in front of his preferred poo litter box. "
11,159191877,Audrey Morrison,• Central Park,25 Aug,I just moved houses with a 9 1/2 year old cat who started to the issues with the move.  So this advice has all been very helpful to me!!  Thanks!
12,159191877,shannon quillian,• North Park Hill,25 Aug,I had a kitten that did that and what I did was repeatedly put him in the litter box and wound praise him every time he used the box   It worked!
13,159191877,Kathleen McChesney,• Lowry,25 Aug,"Eco-88 is the absolute best for pet accidents!  I have numerous cats and ran a rescue in Texas, so I have tried a lot of products.  This one (available on Amazon) is the best."
14,159191877,James Cannata,• Central Park,25 Aug,Keep cat litter box cleaned daily or twice daily also. I would just repetitively put the kitten/cat into the litter over and over throughout the day. My guess is this will stop. Anytime my cats did this it was transient and ended. I did these two things though.
15,159191877,Robert Bower,• Central Park,25 Aug,Hate to tell you but try anything you want - cat pee smell won’t go away. Suggest you take up your rugs (hope you don’t have wall to wall). Cat feels safe under bed. At least it’s not in living room. Hopefully cat will stop this behavior as he/she adjusts to you. Maybe a second liter box upstairs on a large plastic sheet may tempt cat. Good luck. Tough problem.
16,159191877,Kathleen McChesney,• Lowry,25 Aug,Eco 88 really will kill the smell - no need to replace carpet.
17,159191877,Amy Webb,• Morris Heights,25 Aug,"Echoing what others said, Nature's Miracle Enzyme cleaner, there's also ""cat attract"" litter and a can of little pellets you shake into the litter box that attracts them to their box.  Also, cats tend to shy away from their litter box if there is something that they perceive as scary or threatening between them and the box.  That can be anything from a strange smell (candle, essential oil diffuser, perfume) or something loud (music, vacuum) that they want to avoid. I'd also suggest getting a little covered bed to give him a place to feel secure. Also having two boxes for him to choose from might help, and keep them extra clean!"
18,159191877,Amy Webb,• Morris Heights,25 Aug,"I wanted to add I adopted a young cat who had issues with her old owner before I adopted her (he put her in the bath tub every time she pooped so she stopped using her box, and he returned her to the shelter) and she peed outside her litter box once on her second day and hid under the bed for about 3 days after we adopted her. She really came out of her shell the next few days and weeks and never hides anymore or pees outside her box. Visit him a lot and help him feel safe and the next week or two I bet he will acclimate a lot!"
19,159191877,Lynne Gordon,• Montbello,25 Aug,Go to Facebook and join the Cats In Places group. Its a great place for advice and fun cat pictures!
20,159191877,Kristen Winkel,• South Park Hill,25 Aug,He’ll figure it out. Some cats are very picky and the box needs to be scooped every day.  Make sure the box is in a private place.
21,159191877,John Pastirchak,• Hoffman Heights,34w,"Yes, scoop the litter box clean at least twice daily.  If the habit continues, try a different brand of litter.  Also, some cats don't like scented litter.  If you're using scented, consider switching to UN-scented.  I recommend unscented & super-clumping ""EverClean"" which, last I looked, is available at most Pet supply stores.(edited)"
22,159191877,Beverly Morlock,• Beeler Park,25 Aug,"All good advice! If you have not already had your kitten checked by a vet - do that soon. That will rule out health issues. Until the odor disappears, you might block your kitten's access to under your bed. Because your house is a huge unfamiliar place for your kitten, it's best to limit its space for a while.  Place the kitten in a small room with its litter box & food/water. Provide a covered box with bedding inside. Visit with your kitten for social time"
23,159191877,Beverly Morlock,• Beeler Park,25 Aug,"Whoops, hadn't finished, visit with your kitten in its room for cuddles, play/social time & food. But otherwise, leave it by itself for sleeping. After a day or so, gradually increase its access to a larger space, but return the kitten to its small, familiar space for food & rest. Let your kitty explore the larger house space at its own pace. Soon, it will own the house and allow you access to it, if you are nice! 😄"
24,159191877,Dennis F.,• Montbello,34w,Hi Kay.  Amy hit it on the head. Dr. Elsey's Cat Attract litter. They have a kitten formula as well now. Check with Chuck and Don's pet supplies. Also the Feliway diffuser is probsbly the best type. The pheromones provide a calming effect like the mom would produce. Helps them relax and adapt. Congratulations from us at No Feline Left Behind on your furever friend.(edited)

0,152936207,Matthew Lee,• Mayfair,26 Jun,"Why not add a poll to this post?  That way people can opine with a single click if they choose. Gardner's seat looks to be one of the least secure in the Senate, so I think people who are going to vote D should vote for the person who best represents their values."
1,152936207,Justin Retzlaff,• Historic Montclair,26 Jun,I didn’t do a poll because I want Heer what people have to say.  Not just one or the other.
2,152936207,Andrea Lewellyn,• Mayfair,26 Jun,Romanoff!  Hickenlooper too wishy washy for me.
3,152936207,Barbara Williams,• Lowry,29 Jun,Check their records
4,152936207,Trish Philbrook,• Historic Montclair,26 Jun,There is a poll this morning that can be accessed here : http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=a8ccbb6d-abd4-4943-8969-7040eb37d327&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun&utm_campaign=95c18a2477-Unaffiliated-20190115_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_2e5f9a0f1b-95c18a2477-44366825&mc_cid=95c18a2477&mc_eid=6f8ad5cc1d
5,152936207,Bryan Hilton,• Mayfair,27 Jun,"Hick does have name recognition and that is big, but it’s time to vote for issues and change.  If you look at the issues Romanoff has always supported the issues that are overwhelmingly popular.  You can follow the flock which got us where we are now with trump or you can vote for change that will help us.  Romanoff can easily win against Gardner, I didn’t see that question."
6,152936207,James Jenkins,• Historic Montclair,26 Jun,Romanoff has a tendency to side with Republicans.  I don't think he can beat Gardner which needs to happen.
7,152936207,Prilla OConnell,• Hilltop,26 Jun,Romanoff is the progressive candidate and does not side with Republicans. Hick is much more aligned with republican policy!
8,152936207,Matthew Lee,• Mayfair,26 Jun,"Hickenlooper acts like a Republican on many issues and acts to protect the establishment and his own interests first, offering milquetoast support for the average Coloradan. I was not impressed with his time as mayor or governor. Haven't we had enough of him?  Romanoff appears more like a real public servant to me. I think anyone with a D wins this seat over Gardner and am sick and tired of fear-based Dems voting for their team and the ""safe"" candidate instead of anyone who might effect meaningful change."
9,152936207,Marisa Baldwin,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,26 Jun,Agreed.
10,152936207,Kathryn Studer,• Lowry,43w,Agreed that Gardner needs to be replaced but vote for the candidate that you feel represents your views best. I agree that Romanoff is much more a public servant and Hickenlooper more of a politician. I prefer a servant at this point. Especially with Hickenlooper thinking he was above showing up for court. Ugh.(edited)
11,152936207,Marisa Baldwin,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,28 Jun,Exactly.  We would go to jail.  Just showed who he really is.
12,152936207,Paul Sidey,• South Park Hill,29 Jun,Lol
13,152936207,Nancy Arko,• Historic Montclair,26 Jun,"Romanoff has spent a great deal of time working on this campaign. He has been diligent about house parties, town halls and getting out there to meet people and see what they think and how they feel. Hick just decided late that since he didn’t get very far with Prez campaign he would go for the Senate. I don’t feel he’s really put his heart and soul in it the way Andrew has, but was relying on name recognition to get him in. "
14,152936207,Marisa Baldwin,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,28 Jun,Well said.
15,152936207,Heather Bays,• Lowry,26 Jun,Thanks everyone for keeping the discussion civil. Politics are a tricky subject on ND.
16,152936207,Jeff Mason,• Lowry,26 Jun,"While I have nearly always appreciated Hickenlooper as a city and state leader, and I would be comfortable with him as a CO senator, I am giving my primary vote to Romanoff. Romanoff's positions are more aligned with my progressive values. I worry that Hick's time has passed and even if elected, he could not keep up with the scope of change and vision I think our country needs from its leaders. If Hick wins, but the race is close, I hope he will recognize progressive ideas have support in this state. If Hick looses, I believe Romanoff will be very capable in a debate with Gardner and his campaign will be supported by the voters and the party."
17,152936207,Amber Camus,• Central Park,26 Jun,"Romanoff. Hickenlooper’s stance on many issues is too conservative for my tastes and he often tries to reframe his previous positions. Drinking fracking fluid? That was actually a move to get oil and gas companies on board with regulation. After seeing the way public opinion was blowing on gun control, he started to support tightening gun laws as governor but instead of acknowledging his stance changed, he tried to claim he was in support of such measures all along and championed it as an issue when he was a presidential candidate. He comes off as disingenuous at best to me."
18,152936207,Elaine Taniwaki,• South Park Hill,43w,"Joyce Springer, please explain how Romanoff's loss of ""two big campaigns"" translates to his abilities?  "
19,152936207,Karla Simons,• Hilltop,26 Jun,"Despite who you may like best, Hickenlooper is our best chance to take seat from Gardner which, I’m afraid, is more important than like-ability. It’s the part of politics that is unfortunate but a reality nonetheless.  That’s why Republicans have taken out ads against Hickenlooper. They know they can beat Romanoff."
20,152936207,Bryan Hilton,• Mayfair,27 Jun,"Issues are winning this year, hick isn’t even trying.  Sure republicans want a republican lite to win to keep the status quo.  What issues are important to you?"
21,152936207,Veronica Figoli Fleischer,• Hilltop,26 Jun,HIckenlooper
22,152936207,Bryan Hilton,• Mayfair,27 Jun,Why?
23,152936207,Michele McManus,• South Park Hill,26 Jun,"The most important, basically the only thing I care about is beating gardner. Romanoff served in the State House for 8 years. Romanoff  lost twice, once to Bennett and once to Coffman. Hick won 4 times, 2 times statewide. Easy choice."
24,152936207,Bryan Hilton,• Mayfair,27 Jun,"Do you have any issues you support Hickenlooper over Romanoff, Elliot Engel won for. Decades, was a party chair and had washington support.  Times are changing.  Vote your conscience."
25,152936207,Rachel Grossman,• Historic Montclair,26 Jun,"Michelle, I 100% agree."
26,152936207,Bryan Hilton,• Mayfair,43w,"Issues?  Times are changing unless you don’t want change.  Romanoff has a passion for change, have you seen Hickenlooper?  I cannot support what I’ve seen from Hickenlooper, no passion, just status quo which I hope people don’t want anymore.(edited)"
27,152936207,Lois Peterson,• East Colfax,26 Jun,I’m supporting Romanoff. He’s been criticized for a 2007 decision that he now acknowledges was a mistake. 
28,152936207,Diane Grove,• Hilltop,26 Jun,"Definitely Romanoff.  The Democratic Party gave all of their funding to Hickenlooper for his name recognition.  Romanoff has built his campaign through intense grassroots efforts, and he is strongly supported by Colorado’s young people.  They are behind him because he is very clear on what he believes and is not controlled by big money.  His stand on the environment, accessibility of mental and physical health support, and equal opportunity really resonate with me.  I remember when he was speaker of the CO House of Representatives. He was regularly on the news, and he was level headed and straight forward. He can definitely win against Gardner."
29,152936207,Wanda Harris,• Hilltop,29 Jun,Being supported by young people is great-  but so far these same people in many parts of the country would rather not vote.  I vote for R as well-  but don’t count on young people for more than what they do on social media.  (Helpful free media but not the same as a vote.) Where are their -  I VOTED stickers?
30,152936207,Bryan Hilton,• Mayfair,26 Jun,"Romanoff had really thought out his positions and Hickenlooper seems to be copying some of Romanoff’s positions now just because he doesn’t have much on his own.  I was amazed when during a debate he complained he was being asked to answer first too many times, I assumed it was difference because he held a higher position, but it wasn’t a true leader.  Hick is a status quo candidate in a time of change.  He also has the ethics issue which could cost him in the general election.  Thanks for voting!"
31,152936207,Kevin L.,• North Park Hill,26 Jun,"Romanoff for sure. Hickenpooper should try to go impress people with his banjo skills, run his restaurants while buying up all the real estate in Denver."

2,154027045,Nosheen Jacob,• Aurora Arts District,6 Jul,"Diatect Bed Bug Killer. I think it costs around $10 a  bottle. You have to be meticulous with it all around the house and on the bed, box spring couch etc. for a few months. Gets rid of all of them."

5,154027045,Rebecca Thompson,• Del Mar North,6 Jul,"Wash, dry and bag all clothes, bedding, or personal stuff you can live without for a month, and buy a steam shark. The steam cracks the shell of the bug, and kills eggs."
6,154027045,Brenda Jendraszkiewicz,• Del Mar North,6 Jul,"Food grade diatomaceous earth. It cracks open a bugs exoskeleton and they dry out and die. You can buy a big bag on amazon for $20ish. Just make sure it’s food grade. Completely safe to use around kids and pets. Just sprinkle it everywhere there are bugs, wait 24 hours, vacuum, repeat for a few days to a week to make sure you get hatching eggs. I used it for a flea infestation and it works like a charm. Cheap and easy."

11,154027045,Nora Weiker,• East Colfax,6 Jul,"You can use baking soda instead of diatomaceous earth, along with many essential oils like tea tree . I prefer cinnamon oil. Make a spray using 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup cinnamon. Saute on stove for 3 mins and put in a dark bottle for about a month or buy it at King Soopers pharmacy for 5.99. Have to do all the steps mentioned above. Vacuum, steam, soda, wash/dry in very hot, spray an oil. Alot of work! Good luck. N"

12,142146326,Kim LaClair,• East Colfax,26 Mar 20,We get out of peoples way when we’re out walking. A good solid 10 feet or more. Or we’ll cross the street. 
13,142146326,Clyde Freeman,• Lowry,26 Mar 20,Yes the spitting and cigarette butts concern m3 a lot we have lots of those.
14,142146326,Cem Mesta,• North Park Hill,29 Mar 20,Clyde thank you and anyone spitting on the ground should receive Ticket!
15,142146326,Carmen Held,• Hoffman Heights,3 Apr 20,My concern with the cigarettes is that somebody homeless or Tem will pick it up if there’s enough left on it and smoke it and then they would be exposed by touching the second on the filter
16,142146326,Antonia Dalpiaz,• Lowry,26 Mar 20,Imogene I agree 100% I live in an apartment building and noticed a neighbor heading down the hallway towards me and my daughter so we stepped off to the side to give us the 6 ft distance and he blurts out just hold your breath its not a big deal. My 11 year old knows better than an adult. I yelled back Its people like you that will keep this stay at home order go on longer and longer. Some people are just ignorant.  Why can't people just follow the rules. I am all for keeping some kind of normalcy for our kids but at what expense. Stay safe
17,142146326,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,27 Mar 20,"I went out to a craft supply store on Wednesday afternoon to get materials to keep myself occupied while confined. I had two people come into the same aisle as I was and walk up and stand within two feet of me like as if that was ok. Even though I was there first, I moved away and only went back after the intruder had moved. I don't know if people are being that rude or are that unaware of what's going on or not following the news about it or don't know what they are supposed to do or what. Whatever, I found that breach of my space quite disturbing."
18,142146326,Joanne Spillman,• South Park Hill,1y,"They don't care. This has happened to me at the grocery store. I'll just move along if they won't keep their distance. I heard two twentysomething ladies laugh at me for trying to avoid them. This isn't a joke, kids.(edited)"
19,142146326,Andrea Atkinson,• North Park Hill,27 Mar 20,"The mailman didn’t take my outgoing mail yesterday...and yes it was important and needed to get in the mail...I had to RUN UP TO HIM and hand it to him...breaking the 6’ rule...he didn’t seem to care at all....he said “oh yeah, I didn’t have any mail for you”..........so that means you don’t take my out going mail!?! WTF?  Dude...you are getting to work and still get paid...the least you could do is DO YOUR FUCKING JOB!"
20,142146326,Benjamin Conner,• East Colfax,27 Mar 20,Cut the guy a break... if he didn’t have any mail for you he probably planned his route accordingly and didn’t even step on your property. Hence not noticing your outgoing mail. If it was so highly important you could simply drop it in a blue mailbox and then you wouldn’t have had to break the 6’ft rule. The profanity is simply not necessary. Some common courtesy would be appreciated. I’m a courier myself. It is impossible for us to complete our jobs without interacting with coworkers or the occasional recipient/customer within the 6ft space.
21,142146326,Alice Gonzalez,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,27 Mar 20,Be careful guys people are not taking this seriously. People are making videos for goodness sake claiming to be infected and just walking aroumd stores as everyone os in a panic biy state of mind and just spreading germs every where this is just great to know that people are acting like this... My goodness be safe bod bless us all and lets us make it thru this
22,142146326,Mindy Carrigan,• Central Park,27 Mar 20,I cannot understand why so many ppl are still out & about and how few adhere to social distancing guidelines. Makes me feel like things will go on much longer than they need to.
23,142146326,Joanne Spillman,• South Park Hill,29 Mar 20,They. Don't. Care.
24,142146326,Donna Wallace,• Lowry,5 Apr 20,so agree...apparently we need  a police state as we don’t get it right voluntarily

There are people pushing the boundaries. Exercising in groups, not giving enough distance to others, and the spitting. Seeing a few male runners spitting. 🤷‍♂️"
27,142146326,Chris T.,• Central Park,28 Mar 20,"For the 20% vulnerable, you probably should not be going outside unless absolutely necessary.  You can't control other people's actions, but you can protect yourself since you are at the greatest risk"
28,142146326,Shari Wilkins-Duley,• North Park Hill,28 Mar 20,Dick Lee you’re ‘not going to go touch metal things and spread any of (your) dreams’?  Why not spread your dreams?  That’s the good stuff in life.  💕

33,142146326,Serena Ku,• South Park Hill,29 Mar 20,Gross.
34,142146326,Jamie Higgins,• North Park Hill,28 Mar 20,"Any other regular runner on here knows that spitting when running, just like when your nose starts to “run” because it’s cold out is all part of getting rid of stuff that needs to get out of your body. Providing someone isn’t spitting Near you or close to 6 feet, please don’t complain about a runner spitting. If they make the guidelines any stricter,  people will follow them even less. We need to get outside and get fresh air- we need exercise and not everyone can invest in home equipment. You will hear advice to get outside and advice to exercise from any medical or mental health professional especially at this time when we can’t be around anyone other than our household. It is vital to mental health. This is hard enough for many without making it even more complicated.  Social distance, stay at home except for vital needs and exercise, and we will flatten the curve and get back to normalcy sooner. People constantly complaining on next door doesn’t help at all. For those complaining about the teens, perhaps their parents need to revisit this with them and re educate on the importance of social distancing and that it won’t be forever. But for a second, try to imagine what it feels like to be a child or teen right now when your friends and school are such such a huge part of your world. That was taken from them abruptly and we can’t even tell them when it will end. Friends are a huge source of support when you’re a teen. This is really hard for kids. I think some forget what that might be like. "
35,142146326,Keegan Perkins,• Central Park,1y,"Spitting can be a health hazard. Not sure what the problem is with just swallowing. I understand if you got a bug in your mouth, but. One problem is someone would step in it and track it home on their shoes. Not a made up thing. Animal shelters are very aware of disease transmission, including by shoes. And there’s a reason health facilities do shoe protection as well. Spitting is also sending particles into the air, as does snot rocketing. Runnersworld had a piece recommending people refrain from spitting. I don’t see why it’s necessary. Use a tissue if you need to.(edited)"

38,142146326,Janelle Miller,• Aurora,1y,"This is probably going to sound mean But... I believe that if some people are dumb enough to go out and about and do whatever they want during this crisis time, I think, we should let nature run it’s course or natural selection run it’s course...whatever you prefer to say.... We all know the statistics now, most of us watch the news, and have heard the health safety orders that are have been put into place... So if you want to be a “Macho” person and go out and do whatever when most people are trying to follow the order and be safe, then so be it... Let them do them... we have NO control over other people, so Let them get COVID-19, the less Unsafe people we have in this world, spreading their nasty germs-The Better!!

I think if our congressmen are so set on “making our city safer” than ban those people who keep choosing to bring their aggressive dogs to public places/parks and have no repercussion. Not trying to start an aggressive chain of comments, just wondering why we don’t try harder to punish the people who trained (or lack thereof) an aggressive dog and have no responsibility/repercussion for their actions."

I have a puppy who was rescued from being dumped at a Dairy Queen parking lot in a box and looked to be pointer but as he has started to grow he is pit bull. All he does is cuddle. He was failed by humans once and now twice. If you met him and told me you think we should not be here that would be one thing, but you have no idea what the dogs being told they are unwelcome are really like. History has proven it VERY dangerous to have a mind like yours toward other groups."

4,154339954,Ben Miller,• Central Park,12 Jul,🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️. You people think meat grows on trees.  And it’s not a sport. It’s for the meat and the meat only. I don’t keep furs or trophies so don’t come at me with that shit. I try my best not to eat meat from grocery stores because I find it unethical. And I’m sorry that I can drive something because I worked my a$$ off every day unlike you
5,154339954,Tree Wallace,• East Colfax,13 Jul,"No, many of us realize meat does not grow on trees - & do realize the atrocities of the ‘food animal’ business.  Many of us realize the health implications of a meat eating society & make other choices.  To purposely decide to hurt & kill another living creature is pretty offensive to many & maybe u don’t want to talk about it here. There is plenty of food to eat without being hurtful. Americans eat too much protein & it is causing kidney disease! Also cancers!  Read ‘the China study’ for the largest research ever done which showed the problems of an animal protein diet! "
6,154339954,Anthony Lebermann,• Lowry,12 Jul,"Ben, I think your going to have a little trouble finding bear in the high country on public land this year.  Bears seem to be coming down the mountain more this year due to lack of food, high temps and no precipitation seem to have made their food source scares, Either way good Luck and happy hunting!  and pay no mind to the folks that don't understand why you hunt, I know many hunters, I am not one, but you are a good bunch of folks."

14,154339954,Patrick S.,• Historic Montclair,40w,"I am a well-educated person, actually. I happen to also be a hunter, and I have watched all kinds of completely well-intentioned, yet totally backward Boulder-inspired nonsense pass for sound conversation policies over the past 25 years. I have also been harassed by Boulder yuppies in the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area while lawfully engaged in hunting while the person harassing me was breaking the law with their dog off leash. I chose the word 'suck' because it was the most appropriate vocabulary word to describe how people with zero scientific training along with a surplus of emotion-laden pseudo-ecological, emotional diarrhea try to drive conservation policy in this state.(edited)"

4,167117097,Susan Cardasis,• East Colfax,7 Nov,Not the media calling the races exactly.  The information for the announcement comes from the Secretaries of State.

I’m not sure what sector of people you’re thinking of but it’s definitely not those who seem to be out celebrating 🤷🏻‍♀️"
9,167117097,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,9 Nov,"I am loving this. I've kept my mouth shut for 4 looooong years and finally there's an environment where I feel I can speak my mind. I would never have voted for trump, whose biggest accomplishment was being a ""reality tv star"" famous for yelling, ""You're fired"". Great credentials and qualifications for the highest public office in the US. When I heard him say he ""loves the uneducated"" and that he could ""shoot someone in the middle of 5th Avenue and people would still vote for me"" that was all that I needed to know. I would have voted for a paper sack above voting for trump. And this time I would have voted for a wet, half rotted paper sack with a week old maggoty sandwich in it. It still would have been better in my mind than another 4 years of trump."

32,167117097,Carol Summerlin,• Windsor Gardens East,23w,Kelly Taylor. Kamala flirts and giggles like a teenager. So annoying. 4 more years of that?!!!  And it’s actually an injustice to all women who try to be professional and act from their intellect and skills instead of “cutesy” manipulation. Harris just knows that Biden “eats” it up.(edited)
0,137580184,TM V.,• Hale,17 Feb 20,"I read an article the other day that interviewed folks in need about this topic... many of them wondered why we donate things like clothing to organizations who then charge to redistribute it rather than simply taking our donations directly to the folks in need. So to answer your question - if you drive to the Rescue Mission and/or United Way in the ball park neighborhood, you will find plenty of people who will accept your donations."
1,137580184,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,18 Feb 20,"I agree with that statement we donate and they sell, giving nothing back to the community that needs them so we can take directly to the organization, and make a note on calendar for tax purposes.Documentation is all it takes for tax write off."

6,137580184,Laurie Bogue,• Hale,17 Feb 20,There's one more option. Barb McMahon at 1212 Garfield collects clothing - you can leave bags or boxes on her front porch - and distributes it through a thrift store which opens its doors to homeless folks two days a week. If I can find the name of the thrift store I will post it here by tomorrow.
7,137580184,Laurie Bogue,• Hale,17 Feb 20,The store is The Humanity Store at 2526 Welton St.
8,137580184,Laurie Bogue,• Hale,17 Feb 20,Barb will sort through clothing left on her front porch and will take it to the Humanity Store. She is truly an angel volunteering a tremendous amount of time and energy helping make life a little better for a lot of people.

12,137580184,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,18 Feb 20,"Hi Kim I ask for your donation to, for new released incarcerated women from prison. The prison is my ministry thru my church, and I work with them trying to help prevent recidivism, most of their crimes r from getting involved with the wrong people and drugs. They r required to work when they are released and most don’t even have clothes to leave with let alone go to thrift stores to buy any. All of the suggestions are good, because I have worked with the homeless as well.  Many have asked society to forgive for their sins, but some are not forgiving at all, but if they want to be forgiven of their sins which everyone has and really realize who the real Judge is then maybe people wouldn’t be so judgmental about everything especially on ND, seems to be a big problem. Thanks"

I appreciate and I know they will they know they have done wrong and at a Christmas play they were allowed to do at D U, they asked for forgiveness of sins to society. It was a new program rolled out to inmates as a pilot program  for inmates in Colorado, they did the Christmas Carol, made their own props and everything. It makes my church proud to know what we do is not in vain."

1,176449560,Courtney Wright,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,9 Feb,Ive put her favorite blanket and litter box outside we are thinking someone took her in. Can you ask your neighbors or friends if they’ve recently taken in a cat?
2,176449560,Terri Mc,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,9 Feb,Where are you located? Cats can travel pretty far. Have you checked ddfl under lost and found?

I knew this was something serious and I felt I was somewhat responsible for my brother and best friends deaths and needed to help in anyway I can... so I teamed up with one of my military buddies who also suffer from anxiety and depression... he’s managed to get his life together after being homeless for years... now he’s an entrepreneur and helps others with their anxiety... I saw how effective his Facebook group was at bringing people together and getting them to open up about their issues... so I created this group... hope that makes sense!"

I also experienced watching 2 people try to commit suicide suffer from depression/illness for years and again suffered after their attempts.  For me though, opening up has not always brought peace sometimes just unfair judgment.  I admire you friend immensely, I am glad his Facebook page is so successful.   For me, actual human connections with people who walk in the same shoes is what would work.  Still looking."

7,155712582,Susie Coffman,• East Colfax,23 Jul,"As a former dog lover and breeder I wanted to say you are amazing and I want to say thank you for taking such good care of these innocent babies in their time of need free.  I pray God blesses you abundantly for your love, compassion, and caring.  God Bless you!"
8,155712582,Susan Taylor-Erdos,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,23 Jul,Where is this sweetie now? Do you know what breed he/she is? Is he/she adoptable? What a wonderful woman - another angel here on earth!
9,155712582,Tree Wallace,• East Colfax,23 Jul,"Yes - it was actually 2 dogs! - I got the one & this groomer - Keenya with Doggie Downtime offered her service for free - but - she wasn’t @ the shop till Tuesday!  I couldn’t bare to c this dog in this shape another minute!  so I ‘groomed’ the 1st sweetie with just a scissor! Worked for 5 hours, giving her breaks, working gently so not to jab or cut her.  In 5 hours I did the majority of her body, neck, head & face & 1 leg.  She got happier & happier. Started on the second leg (legs were like they were in casts! So tight & totally surrounded).  I couldn’t physically go on - my thumb was getting sore & numb & stayed numb for a days - still is in one spot!  The next day my husband found some electric clippers & in 2 hours time he released all the legs.  She walked around like a puppy!  She wagged her tail! She felt soooo good.  So I  lucked out & ran into the guy feeding the dogs.  I brought him to my house to show him the 1st dog & he’d know where I lived so he agreed to give me the second dog the next day!!!! Yay!  The 2nd dog was even WORSE!!!! So it was the second dog I brought to Keenya.  This woman is the kindest, sweetest human being i have ever met!  With her skills & her professional tools she got it done in under 3 hours!!!! AMAZING.  Thank God, there was no permanent damage - as there can b circulation issues or skin infections etc from severe mats!  The 2 back legs were reddened. Both dogs had a nail curled up into the foot - but no actual wound.  So nails r trimmed too.  Of course keenya did a perfect job.  We only took a touch off each nail afraid we’d hit the vein.  So I will do more & may actually bring her to keenya in a few weeks for her to finish up my ‘grooming’ job! 🤣"
10,155712582,Susan Taylor-Erdos,• Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,23 Jul,"Tree Wallace There are not enough words to applaud you for all you have done for these dogs.  My dog is like my child and it's hard to hear stories like this BUT once again with people like you and Keenya in this world, it proves how much good there is out there!!"
11,155712582,Amber Barnes,• Central Park,23 Jul,"And she's a newer small business owner in the area, so def worth supporting in general! Nice job on the lil cutie!"
12,155712582,Susie Coffman,• East Colfax,23 Jul,"I do not know I was not the one who posted this, but wanted to say thank you to her as I live dogs and almost all animals and appreciate when someone shows them such kindness"

14,155712582,Jane Skarka,• Mayfair,23 Jul,"I called this groomer, but she seems to only do small dogs. Just an FYI for those of us with larger dogs.🙁"
15,155712582,Jan Delsi,• East Colfax,23 Jul,"Jane Skarka, yes I knew that since I called her as well for my 155 lb doggo. However, her kindness for the lit'l ones is impressive."
16,155712582,Kēnya Stoute,• Historic Montclair,24 Jul,Hi Jane! I recently brought on one special groomer (who I’ve known for years and is fabulous).. she now works with me at my shop and can take on the large dogs since I can’t (due to my pregnancy)
17,155712582,Hazel Shields,• East Colfax,23 Jul,"Wow, that’s awesome! I will definitely check her out ❤️"
18,155712582,Kaitlin DiVenere,• Lowry,23 Jul,If you haven’t found their owners please let me know before you take them to the shelter!
19,155712582,Tree Wallace,• East Colfax,24 Jul,Neglectful owner - loving but unable to finance these extra expenses!  I will help him as I can - plus plan to start him a ‘go fund me’ page & appeal on next door to finance much needed dental work!  Please keep an eye out in about 3 weeks - I’ll post then!
20,155712582,Cheri Nickolay,• Lowry,23 Jul,Thank you for mentioning the kind groomer!

25,155712582,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,23 Jul,What happened with the big black dog? Is he ok too?
26,155712582,Tree Wallace,• East Colfax,39w,He’s been great other than he gets out & runs around the park @ night.  Once he exercises he jumps back in the yard.  The owner normally runs him every night (but he’s been in the hospital for a lengthy time) - so this big dog is very lonely but he’s also very fearful.  I have not been able to catch him.  He had a sad life prior & has only been in this home since Christmas time.  I heard he was getting out last night - but hasn’t been confirmed & I’m currently out of town! I will contact another neighbor near by who has offered his help & c if he’ll knock in his door .....(edited)
27,155712582,Tonia Finch Seidl,• Historic Montclair,23 Jul,I Love Keenya and Erin! Both are great with my scared skittish rescured dog of a year!!!! Thanks for giving Doggie Downtime a shot out!!!
28,155712582,Tree Wallace,• East Colfax,23 Jul,Susan Taylor-Erdos thanks so much for ur kind words of appreciation!!!  
29,155712582,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,24 Jul,"I had a boyfriend a long time ago who told me (about my relationship with my first malamute, who I had raised from a tiny puppy) “She doesn’t think of you as her master; she thinks of you as a peer!” He meant it as an insult but I saw it as a compliment!!’ We broke up a while after that. 😄"

4,133371016,Lovie Brown,• North Park Hill,1 Jan 20,The judge has lost his mind. Why don’t they all to CAMP OUT HERE HE LIVES???
5,133371016,Genn La,• East Colfax,1y,I agree the judges don’t care because they live in another city which has low homeless population i’m sure. I am tired of finding human poop on my driveway.(edited)
6,133371016,Anne Carpio,• Clayton,1 Jan 20,Even Denver rescues mission says lifting that ban is only hurting these people.
7,133371016,Vrnda Noel,• Northeast Park Hill,2 Jan 20,Unhoused people will exist with or without a ban. DRM doesn't have enough resources to help them & have offered no other solutions. Neither does the other sources of big $$. Relatively speaking they can only help a small percentage of the unhoused people so who cares where they stand on it. 
8,133371016,Kj Leon,• Clayton,1 Jan 20,Anyone notice the huge influx of gentrification in the five points area. Maybe it's been there. Saw a privileged hipster walking in the middle of the night...
9,133371016,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,2 Jan 20,What is a privileged hipster?
10,133371016,Susan Young,• South Park Hill,1 Jan 20,Yes. It is disturbing. What to do? I read the city is appealing the decision.
11,133371016,Genn La,• East Colfax,1 Jan 20,That’s what I heard.
12,133371016,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,3 Jan 20,Please look up definition of gentrification. It is ultimately a plan.
13,133371016,Don Leaderach,• Northeast Park Hill,1 Jan 20,You can all thank the liberals for this. Can you say LA. And Denver is also a sanctuary city.
14,133371016,Michael Ellafrits,• Central Park,1 Jan 20,"Vanessa Shewmaker I’m not quite sure this is liberal issue. And it’s certainly not something we can blame local officials on, which overwhelming supported the ban.  In fact; most residents of all political persuasions do not support overturning the camping ban, but the problem is the ninth circuit court ruled 10 years years ago that cities can’t prohibit living in public if there’s nowhere else to go.  With Denver, not a night goes by when all “available” beds are filled so this shouldn’t apply to us.  Ultimately, no city wants homeless to have free reign to live wherever they want, but as a legal issue, the Supreme Court has refused to hear the case.  Why is that?  I would hope the ban could be enforced with the presumption that the city provides alternative options."

18,133371016,Brandon Scott,• Skyland,1 Jan 20,Homelessness in America is a travesty. At least it’s not being swept under the rug these days.
19,133371016,Anna Noble,• Central Park,1 Jan 20,"This is a human tragedy I agree. The shelters are not safe and many are not allowed in them for whatever reason and so these folks are literally trying so stay alive the best they know how. People die. Yes it it ugly and smells bad but god help us all if can not offer compassion. Here’s hoping we can offer real solutions, safe housing and loving communities to our most vulnerable. Let’s hope 2020 brings some relief to those who suffer and are in pain. Choose kindness."
20,133371016,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,3 Jan 20,"A vet came into the VA hospital before the new one was built said he had stayed in a shelter, it was infested with bugs, they had stolen his money and clothes, he was now looking for a one way ticket to his home in Florida, many vets could not stay there anyway they have PTSD and other issues. Now the new hospital has arranged for them to stay in hotels arranged for them and their families. And other places to my knowledge."
21,133371016,Pat Garland,• Central Park,3 Jan 20,Thank you Anna for your thoughtful and compassionate response.
22,133371016,Jennifer Honegger,• South Park Hill,1 Jan 20,Just remember the judge’s name when it comes time for re-election!! Johnny Barajas.
23,133371016,Debra Taylor,• South Park Hill,1 Jan 20,Read the ruling first!
24,133371016,Don Leaderach,• Northeast Park Hill,1 Jan 20,From what? I am sure some of the homeless have valid reasons why they can’t support themselves but I have read that a great number would not take a job offered.
25,133371016,Patricia Monheit,• South Park Hill,3 Jan 20,“People say ...”
26,133371016,Joe Gear,• Skyland,3 Feb 20,"Ive worked with the homeless for 14 years. The majority do not refuse work, but rather incapable due to mental health issues."
27,133371016,Brandon Scott,• Skyland,1 Jan 20,Thanks Jennifer. I will remember come election time and I hope others will too. 
28,133371016,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,2 Jan 20,"I’ve never noticed I think for the most part they had managed to keep city park free of homeless, but why not they seem to be in most parks bathroom facilities more room, I really don’t approve I really enjoy city park and the lake, the playground. Needles etc is not good."
29,133371016,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,2 Jan 20,"I think the city needs to do better but there has to be some sort of control or else we will loose safe and clean areas to take our families, what’s the choice. Do u want to take ur family to city park, where ur child could pick up a syringe to play with or no telling what might be found out city park and golf course use to be attractions for our areas, but they have torn up a beautiful golf course and now homeless in city park, Wow, where does it end? The goose poop, I never knew we had such a good shortage to kill geese in the park, excuse too much poop, well hire more city workers to clean it up. I think that is absolutely disgusting can’t even think of the word for what they r doing. Someone had a ring video of a mentally ill lady knocking on their door, finally she decided they weren’t home and she said she was going to the park to pray and kill people.OMG."
30,133371016,Brandon Scott,• Skyland,2 Jan 20,"I hear ya Kathy. It can be rough out there. Keeping children safe is literally in my job description. Still, it’s better to address injustices head-on with honest communication instead of pretending they don’t exist. Homelessness, mental health and drug addiction have been around a long time and can be unpleasant to look at but I hope we can all be grateful for what we have and keep fighting the good fight for everyone in our community, not just immediate family and peers."
31,133371016,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,2 Jan 20,Many people that r homeless make that choice and many r because of life. Some just walk away from their life and choose not to be found homeless.
32,133371016,Brandon Scott,• Skyland,2 Jan 20,Even if that were true it’s not logical to make sweeping judgements about a diverse and marginalized population. Lots of homeless are veterans too. I assume you’ve never been homeless but have you ever helped out at a soup kitchen or shelter? You should try it sometime. It will inform you in a way that news articles and doorbell cameras can’t.
33,133371016,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,2 Jan 20,If they go to the shelters when they r already full they will not let them in. I think some of these empty buildings the city owns should be renovated in to living quarters for them.
34,133371016,Brandon Scott,• Skyland,2 Jan 20,Agreed
35,133371016,Richard Boehm,• South Park Hill,2 Jan 20,I’m not happy with our politicians when bills like HR 5038 the Farmland Modernization act are passed that are handing out US citizenship for indentured servitude. Corrupt agribusiness wanting cheap labor while suppressing small farms
36,133371016,Debra Taylor,• South Park Hill,4 Jan 20,"Richard, not one white, american has gone to the farm fields to labor.  All that HR 5038 does is protect the laborors."
37,133371016,Liz LaRue,• Northeast Park Hill,2 Jan 20,"Ignorant generalizations aside, the growing homeless population isn't a single issue nor is it a single political party issue. Those who are homeless due to legitimate mental health problems or addiction problems are largely a matter of close state mental health facilities. This happened long before people were spewing hatred of one political party or the other. The economic decision to close these facilities, peaking in the 80s, has created far reaching societal and economic impacts today. I'm not sure if we can revert back to state run mental health treatment and care facilities but we should definitely explore this as an option. Abandoning and demonizing our citizens who are incapable of caring for themselves is a humanitarian crisis and a stain on each and every one of us. How a human being can look at another suffering human being and thumb their noses at them is shocking. When I read some of these comments and know these are some of the same people who claim to be religious...again, shocking. Drug treatment centers, mental health facilities, safe houses, etc. are all resources our tax dollars and volunteer time should be dedicated to. "

1,147635005,Gaar Potter,• Happy Canyon,10 May,It really makes more sense to let the unemployed workers go back to work by reopening businesses With so many people forced out of their work the only people left with income to tax are those receiving government checks. Do the math.
2,147635005,Emily May,• Mir Park,11 May,Good points
3,147635005,Tim H.,• Cherry Creek North,9 May,"Sure glad to see we are moving forward.  With that said, we need to get restaurants/bars open at with protocols.  Why wait until the end of the month?  This should be happening asap for the hospitality industry.  They are the ones hardest hit and most likely will not recover."
4,147635005,Sharron Williams,• Green Valley Ranch,10 May,First we need to see if what the current re-opening of businesses is working to prevent more people going to the hospitals with the virus. Remember we can't over whelm the hospitals again with a bunch of sick people. Who will care for you or anyone else who gets the virus if the hospitals don't have staff. There was already a shortage of nurses prior to the pandemic. Nurses having to work 12 hour shifts away from their family and any social life.
5,147635005,Chuck Graham,• Clayton,9 May,Its time to protect the older and those who have poor conditions but open the rest to the public   its time to open the economy and let us all go about our business .. Im 66 but believe its time to let the people go back to work
6,147635005,Tim H.,• Cherry Creek North,9 May,I agree Chuck G
7,147635005,Al A.,• Marston,9 May,Maybe before we raise taxes we should look at cutting expenses. Unemployment has been paid into the system by the employers and the Government should not have been living off of that money.

At that point it’s too late anyway. I’m still not clear it seems even if in early stages they can’t really do anything. I guess antibiotics wouldn’t even work I’m confused is it just a death sentence it’s like why bother even if a systematic is that what we are looking for, no matter what you should be wearing a mask. Saw a lady trying to go into Walmart and they said no mask no come in, then I was in line at Walmart Stapleton and they were going down the line giving them to people. I have seen young and old running around without a mask like it’s not going to happen to them, I think there is something I am missing I even bought gloves. I went to the beauty shop today, it was not business as usual, have to say I kinda liked it. It certainly was not as busy which got me out faster, there was social distancing I was talking to my beautician and she had someone in her chair she politely told me i needed to step back 6 ft. No worries I appreciated her concern for following the rules. She was very cognizant of the guidelines and following them."

If we’re not working how do we pay for helping these people who need it.  How do we produce and maintain our food, medical, home goods, industrial, pet, children supplies..... list is too long.

27,147635005,Clay S.,• South Mar Lee/Brentwood,10 May,China and the nature of their government have historically lied about this and leadership of our country in the past has reacted accordingly. Trump is obviously not prepared to be a leader and still is not making testing and contact tracing a priority. Trump has a lot of blame to take during this yet he refuses to take any blame. Every president in history says things like the buck stops here but a reality show tv star as a president is quite obviously a recipe for disaster. Makes me want George W to come back even
28,147635005,Steve Cruz,• Windsor Gardens East,10 May,"Oh, I was with you until the last sentence. That guy failed to heed warnings of likely terrorist attack, lied us into two wars, oversaw the outsourcing of America's largest manufacturers, then stood by during the subprime mortgage crisis -- which has been established as the trigger for the Global Financial Crisis, and the unemployment rate doubled during his administration with the final numbers at 53 consecutive months of job losses ""peaking"" at 800,000 jobs lost in December of 2008."

1,154660333,Maureen F.,• Central Park,12 Jul,"I get it - it’s sign if you agree.  If you don’t, don’t.  It’s on behalf of my sister who’s a teacher.  I certainly respect any viewpoints on this, and make no claim that this is the right viewpoint.  The whole situation is horrible and I don’t believe there is any good solution."
2,154660333,Wyatt Whorton,• Northeast Park Hill,15 Jul,"I get your standpoint. It’s a tough one. It sucks for teachers and other onsite staff. I work for DoTS at DPS and there is just a difficulty of DoTS is extremely underfunded and understaffed to support complete online learning until there are no new cases for 2 weeks. We have the MyTech program for students to get Chromebooks if they do not have computers at home but we only have ~80,000 for our 90,000+ students and that doesn’t even account for extra chromebooks to replace the ones that are broken. Sadly it’s just an issue of the underfunding of the public school system in Denver"
3,154660333,Ross Crater,• Central Park,12 Jul,"Terrible idea, there are never gonna be no cases for two weeks as long as the virus still exists. Even in countries that have it under control they have cases her and there, and complete lack of federal action here in The US means we’ll probably rarely even have a decline in cases. All that means no school until a vaccine or for at least 6 months, which given the failures of online learning the mental health of students and struggle for parents who work is completely unreasonable. Better to plan for a safe return as best you can than make an unreasonable request of purity that could never be reached."
4,154660333,Mary Mathews,• Lowry,17 Jul,"Ross, you are exactly right!"
5,154660333,Christa Kilk,• Central Park,12 Jul,"Is this a joke or a list for Santa. Please read before you sign. By signing you are agreeing to keep your kid home even if the schools open until this virus ends. Plan on homeschooling until your kid graduates. You are asking for $2,000 per adult per month and $1,000 per child. That all non-essential business close. That all non-essential travel stop. You are essentially saying that you are going to stay home until this completely comes to an end and you expect the government support you. No thank you. Please read before you sign. I can’t believe anyone has signed this knowingly."
6,154660333,Peter Higgins,• East Colfax,14 Jul,"No one is ""signing up"" for anything here. It's not a contract. Also ... That's a great plan you lay out there. But ""No thank you""? Why? Many other countries in the world are doing that. Why can't the richest country in the world afford to join them? Dare to dream. America doesn't HAVE to be a shithole. We can do better."
7,154660333,Sadie Martin,• Northeast Park Hill,12 Jul,My college campus is online for the fall semester. Why shouldn’t DPS be too?
8,154660333,Adam Feerst,• Lowry,13 Jul,"Sadie Martin Because it’s much less effective teaching young kids online, and many don’t have adequate technology of high speed access."
9,154660333,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,14 Jul,"College students have a much longer attention span than 1st graders do, and have more advanced reading and critical thinking skills than young children do.I can't imagine a child wanting to deal with online classes much at all, and I can't blame them."
10,154660333,Bob Goldie,• Central Park,12 Jul,"This is fine for stay-at-home parents, but for those of us who have to go to work everyday it's really not a viable option.  Moreover, the latest data supports children returning to school (with safety precautions) since their likelihood of sickness or even transmitting Covid-19 are relatively low."
11,154660333,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,13 Jul,"My concern is for the teachers. They're adults, not young children so their health risk is a different category than the kids'."
12,154660333,Sadie Martin,• Northeast Park Hill,14 Jul,"Not only kids and teachers, but all other school staff, and every single person those kids come into contact with."
13,154660333,Brian Plummer,• Central Park,14 Jul,"Because you, as a adult, have a far greater capacity for online learning than a child. Have you ever seen a 6 year old try to learn online?"
14,154660333,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,14 Jul,"I dunno. Kids seem to have a much quicker uptake on computer usage than I do sometimes. I still have concern for teachers who would be exposed and have a different risk level than the kids who could be carrying it with no ill-effects. I am well aware that parents can't go back to work if their kids are at home. IF ONLY EVERYBODY HAD WORN MASKS WHEN WE WERE ASKED TO DO THAT we might not be in the situation we are in now. I've been at home for 4 months now and it's not fun thinking it may be another several months before this gets under control enough to GRADUALLY re open things again. But then people rushed out to pack bars and casinos with no masks on and in general acted like they did in the ""before times"" which it probably won't be again until a long time from now. A little self-control would go a long way to helping get the worst of this over with but it seems some people just can't do that."
15,154660333,Brian Plummer,• Central Park,14 Jul,I agree with you. Im being somewhat of a devils advocate. I’m just saying that my 5 year old can’t effectively learn in a virtual environment. He tried it for the end of preschool and it was a disaster. If he gets distracted in a classroom he has to stay. If he gets distracted online he turns the app off and goes to his room. Added to that there is a significant population that doesn’t have reliable internet access.
16,154660333,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,14 Jul,"Brian Plummer I agree with that. 5 year olds don't have the level of responsibility or self-control necessary to be online (or at any one thing for hours at a stretch, for that matter) all day. "
17,154660333,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,14 Jul,"Even now when I'm in a store, someone will rush up and stand within 2 feet of me like as if I'm not there. Some of them aren't wearing masks. I have to move away from where I was first so that I don't have someone  breathing on me and I was there, not invisible, when they came rushing up. What IS it with people? Don't they understand at all how disease is spread? Don't they care that they might be hurting other people when they do things like that? I don't like being out and I'm finding it takes me about 1/3 longer now to do grocery shopping than it used to because of all the time I have to spend moving away from someone who has intruded on MY space where I was first, or who is walking the wrong way down an aisle with no mask on. It's not like things can just go back to how they used to be with so many uncooperative people around messing it up for everybody."
18,154660333,Colin Griffith,• South Park Hill,14 Jul,"If we reopen schools as normal in the fall, kids are going to die. So are teachers. That's a fact. But everyone's talking about this as if the only two options are to send kids to school with the risks or cause thousands of parents to lose their jobs so that they can do homeschooling. We should be screaming, in every way possible, at our state government to provide the support that people will need to get through this without becoming homeless AND continue their kids' education."
19,154660333,Melisa Jaenisch,• Central Park,14 Jul,"Colin Griffith all good points. If schools reopen they will try to keep kids all in the same classroom (wearing masks). They will not switch classes or mix with other students. They will limit the number of teachers that come into that classroom. If someone tests positive then I do think that class and the teachers would need to quarantine. I think this would also mean that the parents/siblings of those students would also need to quarantine/go online for 2 weeks. Schools are also looking at staggering start times and having cohorts of students use different entrances, increasing cleaning, and hand washing during the day. Schools will need extra money to help cover all of these costs. One of the biggest challenges will be busing since the current guidelines are one student per seat. There are other countries that have been able to go back to school safely but they also waited until the number of infections was lower before they opened, have a robust contact tracing system, all citizens have access to free health care, and there is a more robust social system to help unemployed and sick employees. The US is not in a good spot right now...There are tons of reasons to open schools as well. I really worry about the children whose only meals came from school, only warm/clean place to go, need extra caring adults in their lives, families are going through homelessness, etc."

21,154660333,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,14 Jul,"Ok, so that's about the children. What about the teachers? What addresses the issues that they will face in a classroom again?"
22,154660333,Melisa Jaenisch,• Central Park,14 Jul,Kelly Taylor Lots of considerations. AAP safety precautions that should be adhered to and also depends on local rates of infection. Teachers need to be protected as well. Teachers that are at risk or have family at risk at home will need to be accommodated. Rates are climbing pretty quickly all over the US so schools will need to get creative with how to reopen schools online/in person this fall and everyone will need to be flexible and adherent to safety precautions.
23,154660333,Peter Higgins,• East Colfax,14 Jul,"Those of you who are taking the ""but I need to work"" angle here ... Are you going to be cool explaining your need for daycare to the families of dead or hospitalized students and teachers? It may sound like I'm being facetious, but that is a reality. Think about it."
24,154660333,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,14 Jul,"Peter, I think everyone understands the need to work. IT's just that some types of work put people more at risk and that needs to be considered before a one-size-fits-all ""solution"" is implemented. There are so many variables that need to be accounted for and as yet I don't think officials have even started doing that."
25,154660333,Peter Higgins,• East Colfax,14 Jul,"Kelly Taylor Oh, I know. My wife is a teacher and I have twins in high school, so we're right in the middle of it."
26,154660333,Catherine Wellwood,• East Colfax,40w,"So, just some questions about potential challenges - I don't expect anyone to answer them - these are just some things I've wondered about in this very complex situation.  If a teacher tests positive, do the students in that classroom need to quarantine and stay home for a specific length of time?  Is there a pool of substitute teachers, since teachers who get sick may be on leave for weeks or months?  If support staff like cleaners get infected, how will that be handled?  Classrooms tend to be cluttered - how will the rooms be stripped down to make it possible to disinfect?  It sounds like recess would need to be highly structured with supervised activities since playground equipment can't be sanitized.  How will children's needs for physical activity and play be addressed?  I could go on, but I'll stop here!(edited)"
27,154660333,Wyatt Whorton,• Northeast Park Hill,15 Jul,"Okay I can answer a few but not all as I don’t work on school site rather I work in the DPS central office. Recess as I last heard would not be occurring (at least on playground equipment) students would stay in classrooms for lunch and would not share supplies. Students would get health screening every day just as staff would. Passing periods would be staggered to reduce hallway clutter. Finally most importantly DPS is giving students and parents options to either A) attend school full time, B) attend part time, C) at home online learning!  Lmk if you have more!"
28,154660333,Wyatt Whorton,• Northeast Park Hill,15 Jul,"I work at DPS there is no way to keep 97,000 students and 200+ schools in a controlled and effective online learning system for the foreseeable future. That doesn’t even include the infrastructure and operating costs. It is a public school systems yes but not just school. We provide counseling services. Free/reduced lunch and breakfast and a place for children to be whole their parents work."
29,154660333,Mindy Martin,• South Park Hill,15 Jul,"Melisa Jaenisch Just reading comments—not engaging—but I have been with kids and their ability to wear a mask in our lovely, but horrifically hot schoolrooms all day and not mess with them is another consideration—as an adult, I can’t wait to get the mask off and breathe—not sure how I’d do as a teacher anymore—masks are necessary, they do impede verbal communication, kids need their routines, parents need a break and faculty, staff and administrators need all of our support—I don’t have an answer but boy is my heart open to every question and obstacle we face—(one last thought—we need the big tech companies to get computers to all kids—and give them an incentive—who cares how much—these are our children) kids shouldn’t be without or sharing laptops in 2020 America. To good health and wise decisions and a cooler August, Sept. and October."
30,154660333,Melisa Jaenisch,• Central Park,15 Jul,"Mindy Martin All good points! There are so many challenges. There are also kids who don't have a place to set up a computer, nor internet, possibly not a home. Also there are children who need to look after their siblings. Maybe even parents who would sell the laptop...Lots of different strategies will need to be used no matter what/how we do school this fall. We are in this together and need to help each other along as much as we can."
31,154660333,Molly Halvy,• Aurora,16 Jul,"A few people have posted questions about what will happen when a student or staff member tests positive for covid, and it’s crazy complicated. This news clip gives an overview: https://youtu.be/HcSAbV17kjs"
32,154660333,Melisa Jaenisch,• Central Park,16 Jul,I love be flexible! I’m hoping for a hybrid model but I guess that is just as challenging...I did read somewhere that if they do a hybrid or full online model childcare for teachers/staff would be a priority....not sure what that would look like. If the infection rate/number of infections would get lower the risk would be much less. Thank you Molly and all the other teachers out there!
33,154660333,Veronica Barahona - Ziegler,• Central Park,17 Jul,DPS is saying that you will have a choice for kids to do online learning. Maybe since you have time you can keep your children with you.

1,168232366,Tara Willis,• South Park Hill,18 Nov,Happy to just offer them if that’s best. I offer the sack lunch in general and I suppose if they don’t want or need the sanitizer or masks I can keep them and given them to the next person. Certainly don’t want to add more waste. Thanks!

2,150423539,Jake Arias,• Northeast Park Hill,3 Jun,Thank you so much for this!! It's great that parents are providing a safe place to show their support with their children. There have been many unsupervised children downtown causing mayhem during these and sadly this detrimental to the cause. I encourage parents to please be aware of where your children are during these protests. I was working in aid stations all weekend and there were plenty of teenagers trying to seek refuge after damaging police cars or starting fires. These acts only reflect poorly on the organizers that are trying to demonstrate peacefully. Thank you!!

17,140896902,Mary M Anderson,• Lyn Knoll,18 Mar 20,Yes they are a chain.but their mission statement and their code of ethics stands out to me. You or I even if we weren't homeless can go in and ask for a bowl of soup..

0,144032329,Cristy Davis,• Northeast Park Hill,9 Apr 20,"I think very large gatherings will be out for a long time. I imagine some non essential businesses opening first and places like dental offices and other medical services so that people can easily get preventive and routine care again. I wonder if restaurants might re open for dining with fewer tables or a certain maximum capacity. I hope everyone remains more diligent about hand washing and not going out when sick, which frankly has always been ideal. On a personal level I hope it feels okay to have a few friends come over in the near future, but maybe adhere to a 10 person limit on any gathering for a while."
1,144032329,Stephen Murphy,• Northeast Park Hill,9 Apr 20,"this also assumes that the only people who have been infected have been tested. In reality I would guess we are at least at 10x that rate of infection, if not even higher. "

He also said that due to the shortage of tests only the acute patients will be tested when they come in to the hospital.

The new normal is going to be a place wrought with crime, high unemployment, elevated suicide rates, higher taxes, empty businesses, economic uncertainty, and a monster homeless rate.  At some point the pain of economic collapse outweighs the pain of preventing the spread.  Let’s hope we don’t get that far."

0,147310972,Andrea W.,• Mayfair,6 May,Hey Jason-what did you think would happen next to your house when you moved into the East Colfax neighborhood?
1,147310972,Gretchen Koehler,• Mayfair,7 May,Well aren't you sweet.
2,147310972,Josh Wise,• East Colfax,7 May,"I can’t even see what it is!  Could be a tobacco vaporizer, those are popular."
3,147310972,Ray Maestas,• East Colfax,7 May,"With the homeless, crackheads, ladies, etc our neighborhood has changed, and the police don't seem to care, by the time they get here everyone scatters just to come back. we have a big space in the alley, people gather, sleep, pee, etc. There was a car that people slept in, numerous calls were ignored, we had to go to city council.  strange people coming into our yard, crackheads coming to our kids and asking for cigarettes,  whew, try to be safe"
4,147310972,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,7 May,"I've noticed a very distinct increase in Colfax Avenue ""traffic"" lately, too. SO many more people out and about, so many more cars slowly trolling and turning onto side streets to get swarmed by what appear to be drug dealers and hookers. I don't know why the police continue to ignore this. What crimes are they too busy pursuing that are more dangerous than what's going on around here?"
5,147310972,Anne Delphia,• Mayfair,50w,Colfax is famous for being the ‘longest commercial street’ in the country.  Be proud of where you live and good for you for wanting to make it safe for you and your family.   
6,147310972,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,7 May,Ha ha ha it's changed a little bit since then
7,147310972,Tasha Jones,• East Colfax,7 May,"Is it weed? Because if so, I wouldn’t consider him a “druggie”"
8,147310972,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,7 May,"Hmmmm.... if you're not supposed to be smoking weed outside your own house, and this guy is lighting up in his car, either he lives in that nice looking car or he can't wait till he gets home to get at it. That would classify him as a druggie as far as I'm concerned, too."
9,147310972,Cynthia Estrada,• East Colfax,7 May,How can you tell what he is doing? And welcome to East Colfax
10,147310972,Brandon M.,• South Park Hill,7 May,If they’re doing it in a vehicle I’d definitely call them druggies.
11,147310972,Cynthia Estrada,• East Colfax,7 May,"Well, Hi my name is Cynthia and I smoke cannabis in my car, I'm a druggie😁"
12,147310972,Susan Tattershall,• South Park Hill,7 May,"We are all going through weird times, stressful times.  We don’t know what the guy in the car is actually doing, and yes, East Colfax can be a bit dodgy.  But let’s be kind to one another.  It’s a time for compassion."
13,147310972,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,7 May,So we can't call what looks like a druggie a druggie because it's not compassionate? Sometimes the best compassion is recognizing a problem and calling it what it is. Being truthful isn't necessarily not compassionate. Just ask anyone in Al-Anon.
14,147310972,Susan Tattershall,• South Park Hill,7 May,I was referring as much to the thread of replies as to the fact that we do not know if this gentleman is a “druggie” or not.

17,147310972,Ch Hager,• East Colfax,7 May,"It is compassionate to report such to the police, because operating a car intoxicated endangers the person’s and others‘ lives. Regardless  of what mind altering substance they use, it is against the law."

Why has the quarantine brought out the worst judgements people?!? Think before you speak please. You don’t know their story! If you have such a problem with it, knock on the window and ask them if they can move on a bit so they aren’t in front of your house."
20,147310972,Adam Chou,• North Park Hill,8 May,Then go smoke it in your backyard when the kids are asleep. Why can he smoke it in our neighborhood in front of our kids?!
21,147310972,Sam Dancis,• East Colfax,7 May,"You're saying in a time of extreme stress and uncertainty, people who are addicted to drugs, and/or who use them as a coping mechanism would what, stop? What aspect of the response to the pandemic would support that? You're hoping they would die? because....they deserve less compassion and support than other folks? Is this person harming you? Seems like they are doing it in the safety, and assumed privacy of their own car."
22,147310972,Anne Delphia,• Mayfair,7 May,OMG 😳 those that are questioning Jason are assuming that he doesn’t know the difference between smoking pot and using a more serious drug.  Why don’t all of you that have inferred Jason has made a mistake in his assessment of this guy (in car 🚗 in front of his house) wasn’t doing drugs but something less intrusive.  Why are you not giving Jason the benefit of the doubt and believing him? I think most of us know the difference between knowing what lightning up pot looks like and lightning up crack on a spoon or some other type of drug.  Don’t shoot the messenger.
23,147310972,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,7 May,"PUHLEASE read all the posts. I didn't coin the word and wasn't the first to use it. I just used what had been posted before me. Are you calling out everybody else on the use of the word ""druggies"" or just me because I was the LAST one to use it?"
24,147310972,Krysten Hudspith,• East Colfax,7 May,"If your reasoning behind using demeaning and hateful names is ""he said it first"", then it's probably not the best choice."
25,147310972,Jove Wang,• Mayfair,7 May,"I’m not talking about the word druggie thing at all. I’m talking about your “‘Attend one sometime, maybe you might find some grace and compassion’”Just like you?” Comment."
26,147310972,Jove Wang,• Mayfair,7 May,"sorry, normally I don’t intrude and/or comment, but that was uncalled for. Some people are to afraid to talk about their problems so they turn to drugs and alcohol. Even if you’re living a good life, it doesn’t mean the person next to you is. They could be going thought something. You think it’s funny to try and call someone out cause of drinking? It’s not. People are afraid to speak their minds because of the way society is run. They can’t feel safe because people like you say crap like what you just said. I’m in no one condoning heavy drinking, but all I’m saying is some people do it because that’s the only thing they can think doing."

0,150958489,Jerry Dowdy,• Central Park,8 Jun,I have heard great things about Northfield Vet Hospital and Dr Jen Weston.  Other options are Stapleton Vet Hospital (off Montview and near Ubergrippen).  There is also VCA Alemeda in Lowry but they can be expensive.
1,150958489,Cem Mesta,• North Park Hill,8 Jun,Montclair Animal Clinic.. Dr. Sharky.. good Vet and reasonable pricing... not like others  in the area.

13,150958489,Janelle Miller,• Aurora,16 Aug,VCA is so expensive!! $120 just to walk in and be seen. I would suggest Planned Pethood Plus or Broadview Animal clinic which is on 10300 E Evans in Denver- not too far at all- I take both my dogs there.

I am involved with a charity that provides brown bag lunches, essentials from hotels, clothes (especially jackets and sweaters) and suitcases. I will buy them for a minimal cost but can give you a donation receipt for taxes of actual used value. We had changed our Christmas Eve distribution to March bc many of our volunteers were not available.  We had to postpone to end of March and it had to be postponed until October. One of our volunteers have room to store in their basement. I have collected and purchased suitcases at ARC and Goodwill and bought from Next Door. I can pick them up as early as tomorrow or if anyone else has anything else to donate I can pick up anytime b4 October. Suitcases and backpacks are the 1st thing homeless want and are usually given away in the 1st 10 minutes they arrive. Bc different volunteers arriving at different times, the bags are spread out in the 4 or 5 hours we are there. Plus it is so helpful we can pack the suitcases with donations so easier for volunteers to bring instead of in garbage bags that rip!"

It is sad but people do need to understand that they need to be careful in those circumstances.

1,174430567,Mariee Santistevan,• Sunnyside,23 Jan,QUESTION: What's the difference between TANF & the diversion program?
2,174430567,Brett Schager,• Wyco Park,24 Jan,"Good question.  Diversion is a one-time payment for someone who does not qualify for TANF  It makes you ineligible for TANF for a year because it's meant to prevent you from needing TANF later on.  I do not do eligibility, so I can't tell you what the income guidelines are, but TANF and Diversion are generally for anyone low-income with a child under 18 in the household. If you are over income for TANF, you may be eligible for Diversion, which in my experience usually covers rent costs and overdue bills.  We also have special grants related to the pandemic and our workforce services."
0,148036203,Julie L.,• Smoky Hill,13 May,"Put them both is BIG pots. 10 gallons if you can but no less than 7 gallons. The raspberries need a lot of water and don't bear fruit until 2nd year. Let the tomatoes dry between watering, fertilize the soil well with compost, bone meal, calcium and garden lime (to prevent blossom rot), and feed the plant once every two weeks with a high nitrogen based plant food. YouTube has tons of videos on how to prune them for best result. Water them without getting the leaves wet to prevent mildew. I would also get some marigolds or nasturtiums to help keep the bugs away. Oh and keep an eye on the weather for hail. Good luck! 🙂"

I actually thought to myself- did they remove the stay at home orders? Well I wear my N 95 and tons of gloves and hand sanitizer. Well I go in and it's packed. Grabbed some very much needed Essentials and took my stuff to register. Cashier was in training and no mask or gloves. As I was paying some older female employee was walking around telling customers "" keep you're distance if you wanna live"" and she had no problem anyone out loud. So sad for the deceased and the families. Walmart in Stapleton has people  monitoring how many people walk in and making sure they keep the distance. One thing that is concerning is that the bottle of some sort of cleaner they provide does not even contain alcohol. I took the time to read it. So I just used my hand sanitizer to clean everything in my basket and the basket. Walmart needs to provide more cleaning supplies."

8,136311197,Christopher P.,• Harvey Park,7 Feb 20,They don't enforce these laws now!   The only thing this  will do is promote more people living in single family residences and allowing even more cars to a house. There is a house not far from me that I literally counted 11 vehicles parked in front of it.  On what used to be the lawn etc...   This is ridiculous and the powers that are suggesting this is a good idea are also ridiculous...  It is not an either or scenario for those who say better than people living on the streets.  Most of those people are not on teh streets because of these rules!

But also people need to take responsibility. Compassion and common sense are two great abilities. The world is not and will never be black and white.

Seems like a lot of cars...and potential people - each one can have related people in the home too?  So a 2000 square foot home can have up to 10 unrelated people.  Not saying that this shouldn't be looked at just make it reasonable and then enforce it.(edited)

16,136311197,Diane Duncanson,• Marston,7 Feb 20,I have reviewed the information for this proposal and can find nothing in it to benefit the citizens of Denver. Aside from the obvious parking issues which could potentially be 16 more vehicles parked on the streets. All this does is allow non Denver residents that own property in Denver to get more in rent and create ghettos. Please contact your Councilperson and let them know you oppose this ordinance change.

We know of two Section 8 housing locations where the occupants are supposed to be a woman and her children. Grandma, great grandmoms, boyfriend and a host of others bunk under the same roof.  New s never watered (replaced a multitude of times), window coverings trashed, broken windows, dog excrement all over, and the insides look squalid.  Just saying.

28,136311197,Ken S.,• Whittier,7 Feb 20,"Steve H Please read what definition of Gerrymandering is. Hint it is a political term Not a zoning term. I believe in capitalism and made $ building moderate and low income housing in Denver for 20 years. The current free market in real estate and higher end houseing market left to its own has contributed to many but not all of the problems. The United States has not had a completely free market in over 150 years. Read the history of the Erie Canal which could never have been built without government subsidies. That Canal provide a major boost in the economy during that period while the country was in a recession with grain and other agricultural products flowing to Eastern cities and industrial products going west. Many of the railroads the same and in particular the East West Continental Railroads were highly lsubsidized. I completely agree that these efforts are a drop in the proverbial bucket for very low income and homeless which is a far more complex problem that housing. Where would young teachers, restaurant and grocery workers, other service and factory and warehouse workers live in the future. Answer will be building further East, North into prime farmland for example Weld County. Weld  is the largest producer and of Agricultural products in Colorado and more than any in the West until the large Agricultural Valleys in Southern California. South also to Colorado Springs. This is highly iinefficiencty spreading out chewing up more land and resources. Maybe you have your little slice of heaven. I do but I am 71 and I care about my kids and grandchildren in Denver where my daughter who has a College degree and her husband a Community College Business degree. They struggle living in a two bedroom apartment with kids. They will move in with me and I will move into my basement until I build my garage and 700 square ft living space. I care about how my grandchildren and there working class peers are educated etc. I have a law degree and a. Master's degree. Athletic ability paid for most of my education and growing up in two schools systems one ranked #2 in New York State and the other somewhere in the top 8 in Illinois."

30,136311197,Kristi Valdez,• Cole,7 Feb 20,I’m assuming this new revised plan will not be implemented in single family neighborhoods but pushed into the new gentrified neighborhoods where a large part of the homes were bought to flip rather than live in and now these landlords are more than willing to let as many strangers they can get into their houses to make a profit. If these houses are not YOUR neighbors than it sounds like a great idea. I’m speaking as a home owner who has already went through this... It will never end well!

7,145788826,John Larkin,• Hoffman Heights,23 Apr 20,"The sentinel had an article about it. Tri county shut it down, lack of social distancing and many employees tested and are sick. covid-19"
8,145788826,Alyssa Guy,• Hoffman Heights,23 Apr 20,I shop here and was watching the news a few minutes ago!
9,145788826,Cookie Hayze,• Hoffman Heights,23 Apr 20,Why did it take so long for the CDC to warn us? They knew when these ppl got sick honestly I'm pissed! All we really hear on the news is about DENVER we have to go digging for info or listen to town halls about our city and counties!
10,145788826,Karen Middleton,• Highland Park East,24 Apr 20,It sounds like tri-county health acted as soon as they knew. Are you getting the telephone calls from tri-county? They are informative.
11,145788826,Cookie Hayze,• Hoffman Heights,24 Apr 20,Karen Middleton thanks Karen  just signed up for text alerts from tri county
12,145788826,Karin Harris,• Central Park,24 Apr 20,"That Walmart is not the one in Quebec square, but how sad that 3 people died. Stay safe everyone."
13,145788826,Mary M Anderson,• Lyn Knoll,24 Apr 20,Very sad
14,145788826,Chauncey Liszcz,• Hoffman Heights,24 Apr 20,Yes I saw on the news this morning that three people from that Walmart died. the news said that anybody that's been in that Walmart recently need to quarantine themselves for 2 weeks!! anybody if y'all been at that Walmart I don't care if you're not showing symptoms it's going to take 2 weeks before you start showing symptoms please quarantine yourself! There are programs out there that will help you financially and plenty of ways for you to get supplies without leaving your house. I'm begging you for the safety of our children safety of me and my family to say a few of my friends and family to see if two of your friends are family and your children you got to quarantine yourself if you been at Walmart recently! there should be thousands of people quarantine themselves right now because thousands of people have been to that Walmart recently!!!!
15,145788826,Chauncey Liszcz,• Hoffman Heights,24 Apr 20,Wow text-to-speech really f***** that up lol. I'm sure you guys got the just of it.
16,145788826,Cindy Carlos,• Hoffman Heights,24 Apr 20,"They sent me this email, so I’m confused now they said no need to quarantine"
17,145788826,Angee Jackson,• Del Mar North,24 Apr 20,I really hope that the female employee who passed wasn't the nice elderly greeter with the black bob that has worked there since I was a kid! She looked so frail the last time I was there in March just pre-COVID-19. But she was still smiling and greeting! Praying for all the employees and families affected :-)
18,145788826,Anais Martinez,• Norfolk Townhomes,24 Apr 20,I was thinking the same thing she is super nice
19,145788826,Amy Dahms,• Hoffman Heights,24 Apr 20,"Scary, I was there on the 15th. I wore a mask and washed my hands as soon as I left."
20,145788826,Gena Allen,• Hoffman Heights,24 Apr 20,The lady that passed was Sandy. She was the cashier with the silver hair who wore an oxygen tube. Her husband also died but he didn't work there. The security man was the very friendly black man. Also 9 employees tested positive. I finally decided to venture out for the first time since this crap started and where do I go? You guessed it....Walmart on the day before they shut it down. I now have to quarantine for 14 days because I'm an old lady with COPD. This sucks. I feel bad for the people who passed but I'm angry at Walmart.
21,145788826,Alyssa Maloney,• Hoffman Heights,24 Apr 20,"From a nurse friend, you don't have to quarantine for 14 days unless you are showing signs or symptoms.  Just continue to wear a mask, wash hands, and go out only when absolutely needed."
22,145788826,Diane Porras,• Apache Mesa,24 Apr 20,"It depends on the person.... and as I have health issues, I will quarantine just to be safe."
23,145788826,Alyssa Maloney,• Hoffman Heights,24 Apr 20,"Diane Porras I agree it is a personal choice. I have severe asthma, but I'm still going to go out if we need something. It's been about every 7-10 days that that happens."
24,145788826,Maryanne Novelo,• Morris Heights,24 Apr 20,Is Sandy the lady that would check receipts when people left Walmart. She had a short bob haircut?
25,145788826,Maryanne Novelo,• Morris Heights,24 Apr 20,Thank You for letting me know.
26,145788826,Maryanne Novelo,• Morris Heights,24 Apr 20,I believe Sandy was the lady that was at the door checking receipts.
27,145788826,Craig Snapp,• Hoffman Heights,26 Apr,"I chatted with a women that spoke to her cashier about other employees not wearing masks and she said the manager told employees masks were ""optional"" only wear if your sick!!!  That manager should be fired and held responsible for the 3 deaths linked there and all the people that got sick from there!!!  Just INSANE how stupid people are being!!"
28,145788826,Alyssa Maloney,• Hoffman Heights,26 Apr,They are opening back up on Monday I believe.
29,145788826,Craig Snapp,• Hoffman Heights,26 Apr,Oh god I hope with new managers and a tight restriction on health rules and the health department observing they adhere to everything!  I did some research and this is not an isolated incident with walmart and the corona virus.  Other walmarts have had deaths and found to have lack guidelines!  I would say boycott them for now in honor of those lost and let them feel the brunt of this needless loss of life and infected!!

12,152139408,Donna Burrell,• South Park Hill,19 Jun,Do you have a home security system. That might bring you more peace of mind.

28,152139408,TaRosa Jacobs,• Aurora Arts District,19 Jun,"Somin, thanks for your kind words, but the question, now, is this: if you purchased a bushel of apples and the person handing them to you said, ""One of these will kill you, but the rest are fine,"" would you want to eat even a single one? I'd bet the answer is no. As the saying goes, ""one bad apple spoils the bunch."" It's time to do something about those bad apples."
29,152139408,Ann Carson,• Central Park,19 Jun,I am imagining how great it's going to be when we don't have any more police officers to protect us. And they get a social worker to come to your house to help you deal with the loss of your items. Vote Trump 2020! Support our police!

0,141633015,Caylyn Tobin,• Mayfair,23 Mar 20,Where do you live? Maybe there are jerks out there this happened before about a few years back where people were poisoning animals. Are you cool with your neighbors? Just checking before we go into high already with everything else going on.
1,141633015,Anna McCaffery,• Congress Park,23 Mar 20,What kind of demon is out poisoning dogs in the current climate that we live? Even if your dog is a barker there is no reason for this.
2,141633015,Lori Goldman,• Congress Park,23 Mar 20,So glad your pup is alright. I cannot imagine how upsetting this must be for you and your family
3,141633015,Courtney Williams,• Mayfair,23 Mar 20,That is so sad. Who could have done something like that????
4,141633015,Ingrid Underwood,• South Park Hill,1y,What a gorgeous dog!!  What kind of dog is she?  Glad your pup is ok!!!  🙏❤️

7,141633015,Jennifer McKinney,• South Park Hill,23 Mar 20,What were thd oups symptoms? Did it happen in the morning/evening? What general area? 
8,141633015,Cammie K.,• South Park Hill,23 Mar 20,"He was throwing up, peeing himself, off balance, and lathargic."
9,141633015,Jess Haase,• South Park Hill,23 Mar 20,What part of Park Hill are you in?  We've had issues with what appears rodent boxes in some of our backyards.

11,141633015,Gina Dunn,• South Park Hill,23 Mar 20,"What a beautiful dog! So sorry that happened. Have you had any complaints about your dog barking, etc? Just asking..."

14,141633015,Jordan K.,• Northeast Park Hill,23 Mar 20,"What part of Park Hill? My pup was sick and appeared to have eaten something poisonous about 2 weeks ago. We kept finding random food and things in the backyard that appeared to have been thrown from the alley. He had the shakes, was the throwing up and didn’t want to be touched. This went on for a few days, but the vet couldn’t figure out what he had digested."
15,141633015,Cammie K.,• South Park Hill,23 Mar 20,Thats exactly what my pup was like!  We are on 23rd and hudson
16,141633015,Benjamin Hazen,• South Park Hill,23 Mar 20,"Get a couple HD cameras. Just the sight of them, and people think twice. I had a neighbor poison my 3 dogs years ago. All were sick and survived."
17,141633015,Kane Cagnina,• Congress Park,23 Mar 20,I've noticed that sometimes squirrels drop things into my backyard that they pick out of the trash or from wherever.
18,141633015,Mary Lou Fenili,• Congress Park,23 Mar 20,How horrible. No one ever needs this. So sorry this happened to you. Those of us with pets seem to need to make sweeps of our yards before we let our dogs out and to stay outside with them.  They rely on us to keep them safe.
19,141633015,Cammie K.,• South Park Hill,23 Mar 20,"Yeah, I definitely will be watching like a hawk now!"
20,141633015,Mary Ellen Silcott,• North Park Hill,23 Mar 20,"My dogs were poisoned years ago. Devastated.  We found out that there was a person with issues who was watching the events.  So....cameras, vigilance, and always be with your dog."
21,141633015,Jennifer Mayes,• Hale,23 Mar 20,"How long did it last? I thought that years ago and after a couple of misdiagnoses, it turned out to be seizures. I didn’t know at the time but apparently it’s pretty common in dogs and treatable. My dog was about 5 when it started and the symptoms were very similar."
22,141633015,Genn La,• East Colfax,23 Mar 20,They were doing that when I lived near city park. Throwing things over the fence and killing. Unbelievable this is happening now with all that’s going on.
23,141633015,Keri Robinson,• Central Park,23 Mar 20,Could he have gotten into a plant that wasn’t good for him? Or feces? I used to be a dog walker in San Francisco and occasionally a dog would get into homeless people’s feces that had pot or other drug remnants in it and would cause strange sickly behavior in the dog.
24,141633015,Stephanie Fineman,• Mayfair,23 Mar 20,Ingesting marijuana has the same symptoms as well.
25,141633015,Christine Peabody,• Central Park,23 Mar 20,I am so sorry this happened. What on earth is wrong with people?

1,150011573,Nora Weiker,• East Colfax,31 May,Will the manager check the tapes? N
2,150011573,Tom Fesing,• East Colfax,46w,Replacing your license should not be a problem you can actually do it online you’ll get a printed temporary license until the other one is received in the mail and they use your old photo. I just replace my last week and it only took about five days to get the new one in the mail. Also when it says you had to have a optometry appointment the last three years it doesn’t ask for any proof of documentation so click yes and you’ll get your DL sent to you right away.

7,150011573,Lorna Bourke,• Lowry,31 May,I am so sorry that this happened to you.  I had mine stolen about 4 months ago. Make sure you notify your bank!  They can let you know about your credit cards but you should call them anyway and stop any charges.  Then you ask for new cards.  
8,150011573,Barbara D.,• Central Park,46w,"I think there must have been a ring of thieves there yesterday.  My husband went there later in the afternoon to pick up his grill and they were closing the location, which seemed bizarre for a weekend afternoon.  Figured it was either because multiple people had been hit by purse/wallet snatchers, or they were closing early because of fear of looting with protests.  Thank you for posting and I'm sorry that happened.  I did warn him and our friend that was assisting to watch their wallets, and not to get distracted by anyone.(edited)"
9,150011573,Joe Homlar,• South Park Hill,1 Jun,They won’t check tapes...learned from personal experience. Maybe if the cops are involved?

1,172088991,Kayla Aragon,• Montbello,28 Dec,Just near the house ?
2,172088991,Terri Mc,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,28 Dec,Yes. Near the front door if that's how he got out. Check the shelters under lost and found in case someone turned him in. They update often even when they are closed.
3,172088991,Terri Mc,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,28 Dec,"Ddfl.org, auroraanimalshelter.gov, Denveranimalshelter.gov are the closest in the area"

6,172088991,Angel Acosta,• Montbello,11 Jan,:-(  Did you follow some of the tips above?  It sure can feel daunting when you are in search of your pet.  Staying on top of the search via social media and physically - posting flyers etc. works for most folks.  Hang in there!
7,172088991,Kayla Aragon,• Montbello,11 Jan,We did and still haven’t heard anything. We’ve been checking online as well and nothing.
8,172088991,Maria Elena Rivera,• Parkfield,11 Jan,How about this rescued dog? Maybe not..the marking look slightly different😢
9,172088991,Kayla Aragon,• Montbello,12 Jan,I believe so where can I find this I believe that is him
10,172088991,Pamela Alford,• Green Valley Ranch,13 Jan,"Don’t yet give up! If he escapes again you’ve got another chance. If he has any bad habits, whom ever has him may take him back where they found him and leave him.😕 good luck!♥️"
0,172217963,Akasha Dominguez,• Chambers Heights,30 Dec,just curious if you asked all the neighbors across the street for their security camera footage that night. Was your car recovered or did they just take the dog? I’m so sorry! I lost my pup for almost 2 months and scoured the shelters and everything online and what brought her back was a flyer that I posted.

0,154454160,Lynda Armijo,• Hoffman Heights,10 Jul,Call Police and go in Target and have them make an announcement that the police has been called regarding a dog left in whatever make and model car it is.  I am so sad that people are so stupid and inconsiderate.
1,154454160,Carol Richardson,• Apache Mesa,10 Jul,It is against the law to leave an animal in a hot car. Hope that the dog is ok.
2,154454160,Douglas Wells,• Hoffman Heights,11 Jul,What law ? Laws don't mean squat.
3,154454160,Jessica Meadows,• Norfolk Glenn,13 Jul,"Yes , yes there is"
4,154454160,Kelsey Comeau,• Central Park,40w,"Always call the authorities first. Try the store and see if they can call for the owner. If no one shows and the dog is visibly distressed and in danger, break the window. CO law was passed protecting anyone for breaking the window of a vehicle to save a child or pet in danger. "
5,154454160,Amy Dahms,• Hoffman Heights,10 Jul,Can’t you break the windows for that?
6,154454160,Colleen Bevil,• Del Mar North,10 Jul,YEs! Break the window!

10,154454160,Paula Macias,• Hoffman Heights,10 Jul,Yes I called manager an authority's waited for them to come out I had to let them have it!
11,154454160,Carol Richardson,• Apache Mesa,10 Jul,How much trouble did they get into?
12,154454160,Cecilia Romero,• Chambers Heights,10 Jul,Was the dog okay??
13,154454160,Diane Porras,• Apache Mesa,10 Jul,They most likely will have gotten an animal cruelty charge and a court summons

18,154454160,Melanie Driscoll,• Central Park,10 Jul,Colorado is one of 8 states that has a Good Samaritan law that allows any person to break a car window to save a pet or person. I would not hesitate if a pet or child was in danger.
19,154454160,Jen Brunz,• Lyn Knoll,10 Jul,Are you sure the car wasn’t on with the AC????
20,154454160,Jen Brunz,• Lyn Knoll,41w,My car turns on with a remote start and is temp controlled when started with remote. And this Subaru looks like it’s newer. So pretty sure it doesn’t need to be fancy with a “dog mode”. Just saying.(edited)
21,154454160,EJ Vill,• Central Park,11 Jul,"If you ever see a dog in a Tesla be sure to look at the screen inside the car. The screen will have a message in large bold print alerting bystanders what the temperature is inside the vehicle if the owner has left the vehicle in “dog mode”.  Occasionally I will leave my dog in the car for just a few minutes on a very hot day to run in and pick up food or coffee at a restaurant. In an electric vehicle you can leave climate control on when vehicle is off. Setting car to dog mode when you leave the car will keep the AC on and keep temperature below 70 degrees and will display the current temperature on the center screen in very large print easily seen from outside the vehicle. If you don’t see this, then you should be concerned."

23,154454160,EJ Vill,• Central Park,11 Jul,"Karena Carlson well Karen, that was the point of the post, to inform people who may not know this when seeing a dog in a Tesla since most cars don’t automatically protect animals. Thanks for stopping by.."
24,154454160,Karena Carlson,• Highland Park East,11 Jul,Next time call animal control immediately.  They will respond quickly and owners will be cited.  You will save lives if you call and wait for animal control
25,154454160,Karena Carlson,• Highland Park East,11 Jul,Not everyone has a luxury vehicle programmed to protect the animals inside.  In this heat it is better to be safe .
26,154454160,Rian Innes,• Hoffman Heights,11 Jul,"Not to be a Debby downer, but to everyone commenting “break the window!!!” The rear driver side window is clearly down in the second pic. Breaking the window wouldn’t do anything at all, reach in, open the door, and give the dog cold water while waiting for the police, that’d probably be the best course of actions"
27,154454160,Mary Leone,• Sunridge,40w,What?  Address the concern rather than hang the driver? This is an amazing concept!

4,171938107,Christa Osman,• Central Park,27 Dec,Well I'm not well versed on all of the sites available. You'd need to post more info on PawBoost for sure.

6,171938107,Tatiana Masterson,• Central Park,27 Dec,"So sorry you are going through this. Is your dog microchipped? Male or female? Age? Was the dog wearing a colar? Any tags? Have you filed a police report for the car and the dog? Have you called all local animal shelters? These are very important in order to have a bigger chance to recoup the dog. Please let us know as we can also be in the lookout for these details, which should also be on the Pawboost post and any flyers you print and post around the neighborhood."
7,171938107,Booker Williamson,• Hoffman Heights,27 Dec,"1.5 male, not microchiped, wearing purple kong collar, no tag. "
8,171938107,Tatiana Masterson,• Central Park,27 Dec,"Thanks. Please make sure they keep a photo of your dog with call name. And keep checking with the shelter. But check with other shelters as well, it does not mean he can end up with the closest one. Making posters with your contact info and stapling/taping them to poles (check city regulations) is also very effective. I believe you can make a poster on PawBoost. Include all the info you told me, even offer a reward (very effective). But please include his name so people who see him can call him and he can feel more comfortable answering. If any health conditions, also list. It will lower interest on someone keeping him. Let me know if I can help with any other advice. I hope you find him."

9,170706186,Shannon Haines,• Skyland,13 Dec,"Thank you for mentioning this Mimi. I am relying on Instacart also for my only income and I'm grateful for the work and tips. People do need to know it's hard work, and there are expenses for us too (vehicle expenses, gas, maintenance). Consider the following when tipping also.. are you in an apartment building where there is limited parking and we will have to bring your groceries up an elevator and down a long hallway? That's more time and physically can be challenging. I just hope people recognize that or offer to meet at the door to assist if your not going to tip or don't have it to tip. It really is a premium service to have people grocery shop for you and deliver it. If the industry standard for serving in restaurants is 20% shouldn't shopping and delivery services be in that ballpark? Instacart default on the tip used to be 5%. I don't know if it's changed. I think it's a good thing to tip according to the service also. If your shopper provides better level of service or on the flip side is rude unresponsive takes too long delivering take those factors into consideration also. "

12,170706186,Maggie W.,• Hale,13 Dec,It's a huge privilege to stay home and utilize these services. Your shopper is taking the risk so that you don't have to. It's sad to think there are people who don't tip at all!
13,170706186,Sandra Strong,• Aurora,14 Dec,I do tip Instacart drivers.  But what about when you open your bags and items are missing?  I know they find those items in their car. Why not bring us our items. Happened several times to me.
14,170706186,Amanda M.,• Cheesman Park,17 Dec,Once the delivery is completed they can no longer contact you or see your address.
15,170706186,Lisa Manzanares,• Montbello,18w,This is helpful information as I don’t ever used this service but would not know to tip and now I do if I ever start using it. Thank you!(edited)
16,170706186,Serena Ku,• South Park Hill,14 Dec,"Happy to tip accordingly, when all my groceries are present and in acceptable condition.  I have received soggy grocery bags full of wet food because a bottle or eggs broke."
17,170706186,Shannon Haines,• Skyland,15 Dec,"That is not acceptable. You pay for usable groceries. When something like this happens, and unfortunately it does.. sometimes we drop things or inadvertently something gets crushed. If I know about it, I will let the customer know and suggest they contact Instacart to request a refund of any damaged items. Hopefully that’s what u did. If they dropped the stuff at the door damaged and didn’t tell you about it- because how would u not know about a wet bag of eggs :) maybe mention that. It’s good feedback for us also to know about your experience too! Thanks."
18,170706186,TL Hublou,• Aurora,15 Dec,"Thanks for posting. I'm having everything delivered right now. I had groceries delivered from Walmart the other day by a young woman that worked for Door Dash. I felt bad because I had a couple heavy items delivered. I wish I would have noticed she was bringing stuff to the door right away, I have a wagon that folds up that I use to carry stuff from my vehicle to the house back when I could shop. I would have let her use it to. When I mentioned it she said she would like to get one herself. She told me about the small amount she gets paid by Door Dash and how a lot of people don't tip. She said she did an order the day before mine and had to carry 4-24 packs of soda up to the 3rd floor of a building and she didn't get any tip on that order. "
19,170706186,Nancy Sloane,• Lowry,15 Dec,"I'm glad you brought up this topic. I've never been sure what to do when my groceries are delivered. I went ahead and tipped, anyway, wondering if I'd already ""tipped"" the person by way of charges tacked on to my order. I'm so appreciative of anyone who helps me out, especially since I'm stuck at home with this quarantine! I've always been a good tipper, but now, realizing how little you're paid, I'll pay extra attention to what I give to my shopper/delivery person."
20,170706186,Norah Lovato,• Congress Park,18w,"I am so sorry Mimi.  This is terrible. These folks are driving to/from the grocery store, shopping for you in a pandemic & delivering the food to your front door after possibly carrying your groceries down the street & up flights of stairs and people don’t tip??? "
21,170706186,Shannon Haines,• Skyland,15 Dec,"Well said. Perhaps a softer approach to convey the message, 😋 but I’m learning and liking how direct people seem to be in Colorado. You are right tho."
22,170706186,Julia Thornton,• Quebec Parkway,15 Dec,You can only give what you have I'm 2 miles from store and give 3dollars which I can't afford but I give and not to Wal-Mart I give to driver.
23,170706186,Lisa Kelekolio,• Cole,15 Dec,"I always tip well, hopefully youʻll get one of mine!"
24,170706186,Rachel Makinen,• Cherry Creek North,16 Dec,"It's really sad that the delivery companies are so cheap and treating their employees like crap. Yes it's imperative to tip, but a good business should be paying their employees a sustainable wage, even if they are part-time or contract workers. These delivery companies are making a fortune right now and it's disgusting that they're paying the employees so poorly. I always over tip and those who can afford to do so, should.  But also please keep in mind that some people don't have other options and they are also perhaps in a compromise position and/or strapped for cash because of covid;  perhaps they are out of work,b lost their car or jobs or are in poor health, etc."
25,170706186,Charlene/Joseph Medina,• East Colfax,16 Dec,Instacart calculates a delivery charge plus tips and another charge equal to tip charge! I find that that is all I can afford most times! I have started picking up my groceries after ordering online and I believe in tipping but find myself without cash for a tip! I will try to add some extra to the tip when I use Instacart!
26,170706186,Ann Burke,• South Park Hill,16 Dec,"Mimi Kyles, start your own business on the side! We will support you!"
27,170706186,Michelle H.,• Cheesman Park,16 Dec,"Telmahury Robledo However, you’re letting someone take on the Covid risk that you wish to avoid, so tipping them generously is the least you can do."

8,154402435,Ivy Ruiz,• Montbello,11 Jul,Yay!!! Can't wait!!!
9,154402435,Rebekah Lynn,• Green Valley Ranch,11 Jul,Yes they have been having meetings about a proposed retail center to be added to the land that is south of GVR blvd & east of Memphis. I don't think they have fully secured a retailer yet but fingers crossed that they are in talks with Costco. Costco has recently purchased land near the airport for a distribution center so it could be a good indicator that they would add a warehouse location nearby. Here is more info about the proposed retail center from a meeting a few months ago.
10,154402435,Marc Duflos,• Central Park,11 Jul,That's exciting! I'd love a Costco closeby.
11,154402435,Gail Schultz,• Central Park,11 Jul,There goes my savings !
12,154402435,April Velasco,• Montbello,11 Jul,Is there somewhere we could sign a petition to get a Costco? That would be amazing!

0,152107946,Shan Campbell,• South Park Hill,18 Jun,Here you go! 
1,152107946,LaKia Thomas,• North Park Hill,18 Jun,Thank you!
2,152107946,Shan Campbell,• South Park Hill,18 Jun,So welcome.
3,152107946,Allison E.,• North Park Hill,18 Jun,I have never had a pleasant experience in there! Employees are surly and downright rude most of the time.  I absolutely dread going in there.
4,152107946,Jeanine Ransom,• Historic Montclair,18 Jun,"I’m so sorry-there’s no reason for you to be treated like that, especially since we pay their salaries 😂. I’m glad you have info to take the complaint higher-sounds like an excellent and much needed plan!"
5,152107946,Liz LaRue,• Northeast Park Hill,19 Jun,We do not pay their salaries...
6,152107946,Simone Garcia,• Northeast Park Hill,18 Jun,😟 disheartened to hear
7,152107946,Emma lewis,• North Park Hill,19 Jun,"It use to be the best PO around, but since the old guard retired, in my experience, in my experience they haven’t held that same standard. I’ve also lived in the area for 30 years also."
8,152107946,Shanta Harrison-Sullivan,• Northeast Park Hill,19 Jun,"Emma, you are exactly right. That never would’ve happened if Carl had still been there. I knew that the level of service was going to decline when he retired."
9,152107946,Anne Culver,• Historic Montclair,19 Jun,The Manager should be held accountable!!
10,152107946,Celine Garrett,• South Park Hill,19 Jun,The USPS is a conundrum as to how it is funded.  I was in advertising sales for years and used to call on them.  They are not federal workers but part of federal government oversight.  It’s the strangest organization. They can have Fed. Holidays but still are not federal employees.  The PostMaster is the contact for all things in compliance.
11,152107946,LAWRENCE WILSON,• Northeast Park Hill,19 Jun,Contact the post master in this area Colorado.gov
12,152107946,Julie Spaeth,• Historic Montclair,19 Jun,The post office on 11th avenue by Lowry is just as bad—-rude staff that just don’t care
13,152107946,stephanie Duce,• Central Park,20 Jun,I’ve never experienced rude staff there
14,152107946,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,26 Jun,"There is really no excuse fore rudeness in a CS position but it could be the environment they work in. I have a friend that works there, and I hadn’t seen her at church for a long time she said they were even making her work on Sundays she is a carrier. She really can’t wait to retirement. It could possibly be a hostile environment."
15,152107946,Susan Cardasis,• East Colfax,19 Jun,I live 4 blocks from 11th Avenue post office. And never use it b/c it’s so poorly run and always has lines. I prefer to drive to Northfield where I find the staff is very friendly and efficient. I also NEVER have mailproblems there.
16,152107946,Shanta Harrison-Sullivan,• Northeast Park Hill,22 Jun,"Susan, are you talking about the Commerce City location....the main PO?"
17,152107946,Susan Cardasis,• East Colfax,22 Jun,"Yes, over on 53rd."
18,152107946,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,19 Jun,Call the main postal office or send an e-mail I use to have number but I’m sure 311 can refer you. I sent my taxes certified mail one tome and on the tracking it had been sitting at one location  and they kept helping me until it was located but I started with an e-mail.
19,152107946,Shari Foreman,• Central Park,19 Jun,"Wow, I recently started going there. The same man has been very polite to me each time.  I hope I don’t have to ever deal with her. I’m sorry you experienced that. But yes, go above her."
20,152107946,Mark Brown,• South Park Hill,20 Jun,The post office at 33rd and Hudson is usually not very busy and the staff are pleasant.
21,152107946,Michael Campo,• Central Park,20 Jun,"I stopped going there.  I went three times and every time one of their employee has been rude.  One time, they told me they did not have stamps very rudely.   I went to King Sooopers and got stamps.  This office needs to be defunded."
22,152107946,Charles Schubert,• South Park Hill,22 Jun,Stop buying stamps all together if you really want to assert change at the USPS. Use any other business in the free market for your needs.
23,152107946,Shanta Harrison-Sullivan,• Northeast Park Hill,22 Jun,"I wouldn't go so far as to say it needs to be defunded....geez.  I definitely enjoy having a post office so close by, and I don't think anyone is so bothered by the level of service that they'd want to see it closed!  I say, when you receive bad service, complain!  Get it on record with the main office.  I'm a huge supporter of the USPS.  The government has put them in a very tough spot financially and the employees often feel the brunt of that.  I empathize with them, however, that's no excuse for dishing out bad customer service.  File a complaint."
24,152107946,Charles Schubert,• South Park Hill,22 Jun,I hear your venting LaKia. I sympathize and feel your anger because my late father who was 90 was treated so poorly at the USPS and really upset him hence me. I worked at that Park Hill station for several months and couldn’t take the terrible work conditions. To call it a circus is an insult to circuses! It’s ranked as one of the worst in Colorado. My suggestions:
25,152107946,Natasha Johnson,• North Park Hill,22 Jun,Go to the Postal service spot on Krameria in the Kings Soopers shopping center the owner is Shambe Abdul he’s the owner is been in business For years I use to work there when I was A teenager back in 2001!
26,152107946,Charles Schubert,• South Park Hill,22 Jun,Well Shanta I’d tend to agree with you if the complaints actually did something.
27,152107946,LaKia Thomas,• North Park Hill,22 Jun,Thank you all for your comments. I filed a complaint and they have forwarded the information to the Regional Post Master. Unfortunately we’re still having issues and the mail carrier even lied about us having an animal outside during delivery. Thanks again for the support.
28,152107946,Ben S.,• North Park Hill,23 Jun,yes.  that manager at the post office told us the workers have in their contract that they are allowed to cut between houses    yeah. and trampled my trees and flowers that are trying to grow.  no thanks.  i’ll put up an electric fence if i have to.  but yet we get nasty grams when there is a temp delivery person.  the complaints go no where when we have asked.  oh. and if they say they they will come out and see the problem themselves. ask for an appointment.  no response. just a try to pass the issue along with no resolution.  if you need to send something. i have stopped all together and used the ups store on 7 and colorado.  i have a box there and always.  always the best service! they will see what is the best savings even if it is usps and can ship it from there.  if there is a line it moves.
29,152107946,Charlotte Gavin Goens,• Skyland,25 Jun,Yes they can
0,139582156,Molly Jaques,• Central Park,8 Mar 20,"Its probably not, there are pedophiles that get homeless kids to sell these magazines, they put like 20 kids in a hotel room and make them sell magazines, DO NOT buy from them, call non emergency number right away, so they can help these kids!!!"
1,139582156,Heather Mann,• Central Park,30 Mar 20,Oh no :( I wish I knew this and should have called non emergency.  His demeanor seemed a little off and he seemed agitated and I was wondering why he was going to doors after dark during dinner time ... :(
2,139582156,Allison O'keeffe,• Central Park,8 Mar 20,"Thank you for the reply, much appreciated"
3,139582156,Rob Allen,• Beeler Park,1y,"That kid came by our place twice this week. White kid with black shirt on.  My wife said no then he came back. I told him no, wanted to see how he handled a no.  He told me to F off.  Made me laugh.  Will pay attention more next time. Just in case.  Didn’t think much into it.(edited)"
4,139582156,Heather Mann,• Central Park,30 Mar 20,Rob Allen yes he was not very polite at all-  he was wearing a black shirt and jeans and had sandy brown / blonde hair if I remember.  Maybe 14?  That’s funny
5,139582156,Heather Mann,• Central Park,30 Mar 20,"He came to my door too and it was like 630/7 pm dinner time , I was polite and said no and he gave me attitude and said he only needed two more people to sign up and asked for my credit card info and I said I didn’t want to give my card info out that way and he asked for cash and I said sorry I don’t have any on me and he kinda huffed and seemed annoyed and walked off ... I felt bad ... but he was pretty rude too! Smh not sure if it is legit but same thing happened to us. Was a younger boy"
6,139582156,Rob Allen,• Beeler Park,30 Mar 20,Sounds like our little friend. :-)

1,135107716,Earleen Brown,• Green Valley Ranch,25 Jan 20,"What does it look like to ""end poverty"" when the homeless population in Denver is ever-increasing?"
2,135107716,David R.,• Hampden Heights East,23 Jan 20,As long as there are guns there will be gun violence.
3,135107716,David A.,• University Hills,1y,"And as long as there are people, there will be violence.(edited)"
4,135107716,Hazel Shields,• East Colfax,23 Jan 20,"I work with Denver Area Youth Services and I go into the detention center and I do court ordered substance-abuse evaluation’s with kids. 80% of them have gun charges. Not all of them come from poverty and not all of them are doing drugs. One thing is for sure it is really easy for these kids to get guns.It is almost always about power, being powerful or intimidating others."
5,135107716,Cody A.,• Hampden Heights North,23 Jan 20,"Sure, if they are in an environment where power is the currency since money isn't stable or available. If you work with these kids then you should know that poverty is a breeding ground for all kinds of crime and violence and unplanned pregnancies and many other consequences of people living in desperation. There isn't much gun or gang violence in Silicon Valley."
6,135107716,Sharron Williams,• Green Valley Ranch,1y,"I feel that if more parents spent time with their children, and parent their kids then most kids would not be committing the crimes, or be the victim of the crime. Why, because they'd be at home with their family rather than running the streets. Most parents don't know where their kids are at 90% of the time, they don't know the kid's name or anything about the parents or the environment in which they are going. Sometimes society needs to step back and do things the old  school way. My mother would never let us out the door without telling her where we were going, what time we'd be home before 10 pm, and then who are the parents. Later, mom would go over and introduce herself to the other parents if she saw a friend ship developing. Parents need to get more involved in their kids rather than the cell phone. Yeah, I said this! You go into stores or places and the kids yelling to the mother and she's so busy on the phone she can't stop to pay attention to the child. Yeah, I;m calling you out!!!!!(edited)"
7,135107716,Michelle Conder,• South Mar Lee/Brentwood,23 Jan 20,Perhaps if the cost if living in this city want so outrageous parents wouldn't have to work two or three jobs for the child to have a home and could be there to be a family. It's a bigger problem than just poor parenting.
8,135107716,Lindsay Brown,• Skyland,23 Jan 20,This seems like the VERY LEAST the mayor could do. Took him long enough.
9,135107716,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,23 Jan 20,"I think that a mentor ship would be a good idea of showing more positive ways of life, from men who could be an example of positive influence"
10,135107716,Diane Sokolowski,• Central Park,23 Jan 20,A one hour conference call is performative and non productive.   The mayor needs to have a 3 hour in person community meeting as a start.  This event is merely a way for the mayor to check a box.
11,135107716,Janet R.,• University Neighbors,24 Jan 20,That was my first feeling. Meet people. Form a committee tasked with researching solutions. Meet people again. Implement solutions with the most potential from both long-term and short-term perspectives.
12,135107716,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,23 Jan 20,"A call is a step forward to hear concerns and ideas to move forward. Always a complaint, sometimes baby steps r a beginning there have been programs in the past and people who have reached out to gang members and tried other solutions, parents need to play a part with their teens as well as a prevention as far as their anger, etc."
13,135107716,Diane Sokolowski,• Central Park,23 Jan 20,We are way passed baby steps.
14,135107716,Ambria Reed,• Green Valley Ranch,23 Jan 20,Exactly
15,135107716,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,23 Jan 20,"Why is in person better than expressing on a conference,call in person will cost the city money for security etc."
16,135107716,Lindsay Brown,• Skyland,23 Jan 20,"I mean, if Mayor Hancock can show up to Cyclebar Denver’s Union Station grand opening, I feel like he could meet in person with the community when young people are dying. Esp when his development projects and the gentrification of Denver are adding to the problem."
17,135107716,Diane Sokolowski,• Central Park,23 Jan 20,"Because he would need to look people, grieving parents, in the eye.  He's from there!"
18,135107716,John Eaton,• Southmoor Park East,24 Jan 20,Y
19,135107716,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,23 Jan 20,"I believe he probably has already done that in a more personal way, he is not at fault and cannot prevent it from happening redevelopment and gentrification has nothing to do with youth violence, this has been going on long before redevelopment and gentrification, youth could care less about those too things, why would youth be killing each other because of adult issues."
20,135107716,Diane Sokolowski,• Central Park,23 Jan 20,"If you follow activists from the impacted communities,  you know that they are not impressed with this feeble attempt.  Nor are they impressed with the mayor's facilitation of said gentrification."
21,135107716,Ambria Reed,• Green Valley Ranch,23 Jan 20,"That's great and all, but he needs to get out here IN PERSON to address the violence that is killing our kids."
22,135107716,"Mayor's Office, Director of Strategic Communications Theresa Marchetta",• City of Denver,27 Jan 20,"We are listening, Ambria, and committed to making an impact. Thank you for sharing your thoughts."
23,135107716,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,23 Jan 20,"How does the Mayor facilitate, gentrification? He lives close to the area where much of the violence has gone on, I haven’t seen response from any activist in Aurora or Montebello, if they even have any. Where did u see an activist speak on the matter everyone is saddened by the violence, but there r matters that need to be done, it is not one simple solution. What do u mean Diane, he is from there? From where? Most of u have never ever dealt with these sort of issues so don’t be so fast to judge as to what needs to be done and how. Years ago I had a friend her son was killed in front of their house, never found out who killed him, if it could be solved so easily don’t u think it would be solved by now so it would not be anymore teen deaths. I feel empathy and much sadness, for those that has lost their child I can’t imagine having to loose my child, in fact the mayor has teenagers too. People on ND seem to have complaints but no solutions for too much but fault and pointing the finger in the opposite direction, other than looking at self to find or suggestions for the problem."
24,135107716,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,23 Jan 20,"Then Diane what r ur big girl solutions, since u r so negative, I bet u have no idea where to begin meeting the grieving is not a solution to the problem. There is no comfort in loosing ur child unnecessarily. U figure it out u have so many ideas, express them in whatever way u want to make a difference. U and Ambria ought to brainstorm some solutions."
25,135107716,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,23 Jan 20,Diane u and Ambria Reed should submit ur ideas for an end on conference call or whatever way u feel productive and useful.

Mike Coffman has already had several meetings in Aurora, and Hancock can only do one phone conference. So he doesn't have to answer to people and control the narrative? C'mon."
27,135107716,Jay M.,• Hampden,24 Jan 20,Good to hear Mike Coffman might have learned something from losing this Congressional seat. He had a reputation before that loss of avoiding anyone who didn’t agree with him - including actually running out of building after a town hall meeting.

0,151955996,LInda Poletti,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,"Honestly I can see HD dilemma!  I've seen some people react very negatively  when an innocent employee who is covering the front door to an establishment stops them about masks.  It's a tough situation.  An employee shouldn't have to be at risk by enforcing the wearing of masks!  I was at HD recently (wearing a mask) and I feel like I saw a box of masks by customer service (I could be wrong) and maybe they should at the very least have the box by the front door and 'offer' a mask to anyone who enters if they don't have one.  this might help a bit but again, if someone is refusing, it's certainly not the responsibility of any of the employees to put themselves at risk to enforce this.  I really feel for these retail establishments and dealing with people who just refuse to think about others."
1,151955996,Shari Wilkins-Duley,• North Park Hill,17 Jun,I’ve seen ACE have someone stand at the door and turn customers away if they didn’t have a mask on.
2,151955996,Kate Killin,• Northeast Park Hill,17 Jun,"The refusal to wear a mask makes no sense to me. But yes, I have been going to Ace on the Fax which is incredible and I feel so safe going there.  Plus Ace on the Fax is a franchise owned by a local woman whereas HD is a corporation so I'd rather my money go to Ace."
3,151955996,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,17 Jun,"Good to know this. I will definitely avoid HD because I don't want to go anywhere where there is threat of violence since I think that is a very selfish and ""primitive"" way of expressing oneself. I'd rather support a woman-owned business anyway and avoid as much obnoxious behavior as I can."
4,151955996,Erik Flick,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,I too have been avoiding HD and giving all my business to ACE because of their policies. Please error on the side of caution.

6,151955996,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,17 Jun,"I've heard that some men refuse to wear a mask because they think it makes them look ""weak"". So only having concern for their own vanity and no concern for the well-being of others is supposed to make them look ""strong""? To me it just makes them look ignorant, pigheaded and selfish, not being qualities that I associate with strength."
7,151955996,Rox Kunz,• Mayfair,17 Jun,hmm I wonder where they got those ideas from...”our” dear leader🤨
8,151955996,Patricia Monheit,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,The True Value on Colfax is also locally owned and customers there seem very mask compliant.
9,151955996,Valerie Carter,• East Colfax,17 Jun,"The customers yes, the staff...not so much."
10,151955996,Dorota O'Neill,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,"Disappointing about HD... a few weeks ago they were good about enforcing masks, and turning away customers who weren't wearing them. I guess that's changed now. Will be shopping at True Value then."
11,151955996,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,17 Jun,"Dorota, enforcing is one thing, doing battle with some a-hole who gets violent about it is another whole can of worms. I don't blame anybody for not wanting to get into fisticuffs with someone too selfish and primitive to want to put on a mask."
12,151955996,Justin Hersom,• East Colfax,17 Jun,Kelly Taylor or shot
13,151955996,Shawna Murphy,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,It’s the same at Lowe’s and Walmart. When I asked employees about it I was told management instructed them not to enforce the mask law.
14,151955996,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,17 Jun,"There's a big difference between a store policy to require/ask for masks on customers and one that doesn't bother. I can well understand not wanting to do battle with someone who turns savage about a small request like ""please wear a mask in the store"" but to places that don't even bother trying to get customers to comply, I'd rather avoid them because the more people who wear masks the safer we all will be. Personally, for someone who's been following the stay-at-home orders since mid-March hoping to avoid a re-spiking in illness in Denver, I would prefer keeping myself safe and others as well, since their health impacts mine and the entire community. Being locked in at home is getting a little old. . ."
15,151955996,Joanne Spillman,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,"Never shop at Home Depot, anyway; would rather go to True Value on Colfax."
16,151955996,Laura Waligorski,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,"I’ve avoided HD for years. Ace on the Fax hires very helpful employees and, oh - they’re trying to keep us safe. No brainer for me."
17,151955996,Rick and Cathy Reynolds,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,Retailers will require masks and distancing when 100% of their customers are mask-less and are boycotted by the 75% of cautious customers.
18,151955996,Betty Miller,• Central Park,44w,"I witnessed 2 customers verbally assaulting the poor gentleman at the door who was enforcing the mask rule and threatening to ""kick his ass"" when I went shortly after it first reopened.  Something similar happened again the last time I was there."
19,151955996,Olga Guerra,• Hale,17 Jun,They could and should call the police!
20,151955996,LInda Poletti,• South Park Hill,18 Jun,Completely agree with you Betty Miller!  It's a very slippery slope for employees who are really at risk trying to enforce this.
21,151955996,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,17 Jun,"Personally, I wish the governor would make mask-wearing manditory, but then those who only think to frame it as a ""freedom"" issue would go ballistic and likely become more belligerent than they are already. "
22,151955996,Patricia Monheit,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,I think in Denver they are mandatory.
23,151955996,Andrew Sweet,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,Thank you all for weighing in.  I think the boycott idea is most appropriate.  Patronize those places that respect ALL people’s safety.
24,151955996,Laura Leckband,• Northeast Park Hill,17 Jun,I do t think it’s fair to blame HD. I still go there - I just give the jerks a wide berth.
25,151955996,Justin Hersom,• East Colfax,17 Jun,"Last time I was at hd on Quebec it was basically impossible to give anyone a wide berth, especially the people who believe the whole thing is made up and are not concerned with giving space"
26,151955996,Sheryl Olson,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,"If smaller ACE and True Value can provide staff to comply with our regs, why can't big box HD.  I concur with Andrew S."
27,151955996,Betty Miller,• Central Park,44w,"This is obviously anecdotal, but it seems that more conscientious, less pig-headed and aggressive people are shopping at the smaller stores.  So, maybe it's an easier task. "
28,151955996,Margaret Baldwin,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,"City of Denver has advised businesses to call 311 to report customers who  refuse to wear masks and not to serve them. No shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service."
29,151955996,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,17 Jun,"While refusing to serve the mask-less seems like a good solution, I wouldn't want to be the cashier who refuses service to someone who's going to go ape-sh!t over being asked to wear a mask in the first place. I can imagine that person throwing hammers or whatever they are trying to buy because they can't get service because they won't wear a mask. That will prove how ""strong"" they are. I also don't expect they will wait around for 311 to send someone to deal with them, either."
30,151955996,Stefanie Bell,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,The Glendale  HD was good last week.
31,151955996,Margaret Baldwin,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,311 should be called when they enter the store per City of Denver guidelines. Of course no one should try to physically stop a maskless customer. Nothing in any store is worth risking injury or worse.

33,151955996,William Jones,• Skyland,17 Jun,"Customers can call 311 as well.  A while ago, the Bass Pro Shop at Northfield had about 50% compliance.  They said an inspector would visit the store."
34,151955996,Zak Bugaj,• Congress Park,17 Jun,"People here in Denver have been shot over a mask argument. I like Ace on the fax, and Lowe's in Aurora. They do a good job of spreading people out and both have a giant hand sanitizer when you first walk in To sanitize upon entering and leaving. Sometimes I have to go to home depot I just wear my mask avoid people get my stuff and go. They are trying but they missed the timeframe as far as requiring masks at the door to enter. Since they made it this far it would be hell to change now."
35,151955996,Andrew Sweet,• South Park Hill,17 Jun,Think they could change but it’s too expensive to do so.  Perhaps stock holders will raise the issue if business goes down
36,151955996,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,17 Jun,"Some people will never wear masks. They don't understand the reasons for doing it and don't accept the science. They think they know better so they will do whatever they want, no matter what."

0,136839630,Tree Wallace,• East Colfax,11 Feb 20,"Thanks for what u do!  Don’t know this cat as I’m further East - but it doesn’t look like he has a ‘tipped ear’ so not sure if he is fixed.  Being a male u can generally tell if u can get a good look from behind - can u tell if he has a full scrotum?  If so, I’d b happy to trap him to get him fixed (or can lend u a trap).  DDFL fixes all cats for free!  It will keep him from impregnating every female in the neighborhood PLUS it keeps him from getting in cat fights - very common amongst the males! I’ve done TNR for years & it is the males that r in the worst shape - with pus pouring out of their ears, or full blown abscesses, cuts & scratches.  When they r not fixed they declare their territory & fight to protect it!  So let me know if u need him fixed! ❤️"
1,136839630,Gina Cuomo,• South Park Hill,11 Feb 20,"Thanks Tree! He actually has a tipped ear, which is great. But thank you SO much for offering to help. :)"
2,136839630,Tree Wallace,• East Colfax,11 Feb 20,"Oh good, I couldn’t tell!  It is so hard on them in this cold weather - another thought is if he is a sweetie & u want to bring him in - is to trap him, carry him in & keep him contained in a room where he can’t hide from u - so like a bathroom & u start by feeding him soft/canned food from a spoon.  Then he associates u with food.  After awhile u may b able to pet him.  U can start by using the handle of a wooden spoon! Maybe stroke him as u feed him?  Then eventually he can have free rein in the house.  He may not ever b an ‘affectionate’ cat but may be safer & warmer inside for the winter.  Then come spring u can let him come & go - so he has freedom but know u r his food source!  ???"
3,136839630,Gina Cuomo,• South Park Hill,11 Feb 20,"He seems to be doing pretty alright with the shelter we built - it has an electric blanket. haha But its the times we don't see him for 3-4 days, like this past week. Its been so cold that I hope he's with someome else as crazy as us. Ha"

6,136839630,Bev Laughlin,• Historic Montclair,12 Feb 20,My neighbor and I were feeding a stray for 3 yrs.  He would come the same time everyday to eat. Could never get close to him.  He stayed  in the parkway in the bushes when it was very cold.  We put dry food out in case we would miss him and wet food in the evening.  Then he disappeared.  As long as you keep food out he will keep coming back.  Thanks for taking care of him!!!
7,136839630,Doreen Rp,• South Park Hill,12 Feb 20,Water is hard to find for animals in this city and so important.  My mom is in the country and a neighbors dog & cats come in all weather for a drink in cattle tank.

9,136839630,Karen Kaiser,• East Colfax,12 Feb 20,"We had the very same experience with a Siamese cat that we found in January outside getting warm on our greenhouse roof. We fed him for over five years and let him into our home and garage. He loved our cat, but would not let us too near him. One summer he disappeared for good. We gave him some good years and so did someone else when he’d leave for weeks at a time. I always hoped someone was able to take him in."
10,136839630,Carol Brown,• South Park Hill,12 Feb 20,"I have lived in Park Hill for many many years.  I have always had dogs & cats.  long ago I had cats that were indoor/outdoor, but I lost a couple that I loved, & more recently decided that I would no longer let my cats out at all.  I have a cat that a grandson gave me who had been a street cat (young).  I got him fixed, put him in the house with the others, & did not let him out. He tried for awile to get out, I stopped him or went out & caught him & brought him back in. He has adjusted & doesn't try any more.  my dogs spend time in the back yard which they cannot get out of,  I do sympathize with all of you who seem to have fairly frequent escapees, but you can control it....."

12,136839630,Tree Wallace,• East Colfax,12 Feb 20,"yes, awhile back i was trying to trap a neighbor's cat who escaped when paramedics arrived when she had a stoke.  i did trap a cat but it wasn't her's.  i knew he wasn't totally feral so he lived in my BR for a month.  i had taken him to my vet (montclair) and was told he didn't have a chip.  i tried my best to get him tamer but after a month i wan't making much progress. he was letting me pet him but not enjoying it.  & never would come to me.   i brought him to the cat care society so he'd not be caged.  within 2 hours he was with his original owners!!!! turns out he had a chip!!!  i informed my vet that their chip reader wasn't working or their technique????  anyway, the owner said he was a feral they were using as a 'barn' type cat gotten from DDFL as a barn cat.  it was never friendly. he lived outdoors. they 'lost' him a year ago.  so, after all that time 'away' and then a month with my almost constant attention, he ended up being their house cat!!!  that's why i recommended they give him a try indoors - cause as sweet as he is, there is hope! gina, is there any chance you'd bring him in, if jane or i help?"
13,136839630,Arlyn LaBair,• Mayfair,12 Feb 20,I have a cat that was a barn cat for her first 6 months and decided a while back to go back to living on the street. I hope that someone is taking as good of care as you.  I have a chip checker if you do catch him.

16,136839630,Martha Pearse,• South Park Hill,13 Feb 20,"That grey cat looks exactly like the one I've been feeding since early January. Big Kitty! I feed on the front porch at sundown--the cat is quite punctual. And, have made a comfy space in the garage with heat and everything except a mint on the pillow. So far, only the food seems to be used. Now, after one previously failed attempt, I got him/her trapped last night and soon we are on our way to Feline Fix.  I hope to find a chip.  If not, well,I'll figure that out when I have to. Much as I'd love to have another cat, the resident two cats and two dogs seem to think otherwise."
17,136839630,Arlyn LaBair,• Mayfair,13 Feb 20,Is that the cat that you thought was pregnant?
18,136839630,Marty Johnson,• North Park Hill,13 Feb 20,"I have a gray feral male (Borris) and his aunt (Natasha) who have been in my care for over 10 years.  I have fed them both since she was a year old and Borris was born next to my garage.  They were both spayed and neutered a long time ago and now have a heated house on the porch.  I feed them twice a day and they get fresh water as well.  Yes, me and my husband are cat people and no regrets.  A long time ago there were a number of gray cats that were born in Park Hill and at that time we were taking care of four kittens and Natasha.  Natasha is a short haired gray and white and her sister, who is Borris' mother was a long haired gray.  Borris does have a sister who is also a long haired gray.  I believe Borris' mother is dead now and oddly enough his sister did show up on the porch about two years ago and both Borris and Natasha treated her as if she was family.  It was a nice little reunion but unfortunately that was the last time I saw her. The cat in this picture looks a lot like my cat Borris but it can't be him since he doesn't leave the area very much and since he's coming down with arthritis, I doubt it since he does limp.  We live on MLK Blvd & Clermont."
19,136839630,Tracey Trenam,• South Park Hill,13 Feb 20,"He comes around (Oneida and Colfax), peers in my windows, sometimes on my porch.  Makes my cat nuts, so he doesn't stay"
20,136839630,Gina Cuomo,• South Park Hill,13 Feb 20,Have you seen him lately?? Its been about a week since we've seen him and we've had much snow that I'm really worried about him this time.
21,136839630,Martha Pearse,• South Park Hill,14 Feb 20,"Hmm. Thought I posted last night but don't see it. So, here's an update in case I messed up the posting.  Trapped the big grey cat (really a Russian Blue). Feline Fix was helpful but was backed up, so I took him (I think he's a him) to DDFL with  hopes that Azul (yes, I named him. Couldn't stop myself) is a little bit tame and they might be able to put him into their socialization program. The woman at Feline Fix spent quite a bit of time with us, and tried a few moves that make me believe he has at least rudimentary socialization. Can't believe I got so attached.  I was so happy that I trapped him the night before, and that he spent the night in his covered cage in a nice warm hallway...I couldn't sleep. I felt like I'd just given birth."

Say...this boy seems to have real potential. Seems I have a talent for that (tho it's not always a good trait), and you might check DDFL after a bit to see if he's socialized and looking for a mom like you.

10,151683099,Katie Rude,• Northeast Park Hill,14 Jun,Grew up in Bethesda and I have picky tastes when it comes to seafood (particularly oysters). by far the best seafood I’ve had in Denver is Fish & Beer. Only place out here that can properly shuck an oyster and all their food is amazing. It’s a restaurant that you could easily see being really successful in Georgetown or on U Street. 
11,151683099,Anda S.,• Central Park,14 Jun,JAX is our favorite seafood place
12,151683099,DJ Leaderach,• Northeast Park Hill,14 Jun,Has anyone tried Hook and Reel Cajun yet?? Think it is it opened by Walmart and Home Depot off Smith road...I haven’t tried it yet 🤷‍♂️
13,151683099,Andrew Gordon,• Northeast Park Hill,14 Jun,"Yes, have you ever been to crawling crab?  Hook and reel is a similar concept,  the food is decent.  Not really good in comparison to crawling crab.  Also a bit more expensive."

17,151683099,Jenny Starkey,• Skyland,15 Jun,Blue Island Oyster Bar in cherry Creek is incredible. They are a locally owned business and own an oyster farm on the Atlantic coast that they fly oysters in from daily. Their food is delicious
18,151683099,Ralph Wechsler,• South Park Hill,15 Jun,I am from Maryland and I haven’t found anything crab cake-wise that holds up to Faidley’s in Baltimore. There are several places that ship or you can bring back crab cakes on dry ice. Oysters are decent at the places mentioned. I was liking Mario’s Ocean Club on Broadway but they went under. 
19,151683099,SK Kim,• South Park Hill,15 Jun,My friend lives in the Baltimore suburbs - we would always get pappas crabcakes.  Those were huge and delicious
20,151683099,Jean West,• South Park Hill,15 Jun,I think the crabcakes at The Officer's Club in Lowry come close.  We lived 20 years in DC.
21,151683099,Nadine Ritchotte,• Northeast Park Hill,15 Jun,Stoic and Genuine and Fish and Beer.  I'm an east coaster too!
22,151683099,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,15 Jun,"Sorry but you will find nothing like them around here. New Orleans or Florida. I had the best salmon in DC, I wanted to ask restaurant for recipe, no chance right, blue crab yum. If you find some. please let us know. Thanks."

12,136643453,Kathleen Delaney,• Hudson Street,10 Feb 20,We are expecting more snow. How about shoveling a seniors walk?  Or walking a dog or sweeping the sidewalk or porch for an elderly person or taking their big trash can to the curb each week
13,136643453,Patty Blevins,• Mayfair,10 Feb 20,👏👏Kathleen what a GREAT IDEA!!  Maybe get some friends together and go make a diffrence..
14,136643453,Kathleen Delaney,• Hudson Street,10 Feb 20,Also shovel the snow and ice away from bus stops and pick up some trash . It’s hard to ride the bus in the snow as an elderly person or even run to the grocery store for them
15,136643453,Rebecca Masching,• Hale,11 Feb 20,"Kathleen Delaney, great idea, as it is also very difficult for people with disabilities to get around with all of this snow left unattended to."
16,136643453,Marianne Verdecchio,• East Colfax,10 Feb 20,I work for a nonprofit and if they want I could probably help them out with their community service or volunteering. It would just be doing some cleanup and maybe some mailing. If they think this might be something that they’d like to do you can contact me at 303-455-1126 extension zero @Save Our Youth mentoring program and ask for Marianne
17,136643453,Caroline Carolan,• South Park Hill,10 Feb 20,Google volunteer match.  In advanced search put in teen or kids.  They have several one day options. Likely requires an adult to be with them.  PM me if you can’t find the website and I’ll send it to you.

0,135497878,Trevor Lopez,• Central Park,28 Jan 20,"Funny you mention that about this group.  Lately I've seen people asking for food, especially around the holidays (go figure), but putting stipulations on people's generosity. Saying they're vegan or vegetarian like they only eat from Whole Foods or something stupid. If you're too broke to feed yourself or your family you better not be refusing good, free food. Damn freeloaders."
1,135497878,Diane Mandile,• Central Park,28 Jan 20,Jobs are plentiful
2,135497878,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,30 Jan 20,That is true but if they're homeless and they have no place to shower and no money for transportation it makes it pretty much an uphill battle. They may not have an ID or a way to even get one. There's a lot of obstacles in the way. I try to always give money to them
3,135497878,David Vogel,• Beeler Park,29 Jan 20,"I’m hesitant to respond in a forum that doesn’t lend itself to discussions about such a complex and emotional topic, but there’s also a big part of me that can’t let this go unanswered. John Stossel’s segment is far from a constructive examination of homelessness. His intent was really just to give people an excuse for demonizing homeless people by viewing them as lazy, dishonest, and undeserving of our help. There is so much readily available information out there that attempts to address this topic from a more constructive perspective, and I hope people will seek out that information rather than relying on shallow and histrionic segments like this. That’s all I’m going to say because I know this is going to get ugly fast, and I don’t want to be part of that."
4,135497878,Diane Mandile,• Central Park,1y,"I agree, this is a complex situation. I do think it's worth sharing the varied sides of this story.(edited)"
5,135497878,Valerie Sarni,• Beeler Park,1y,"Agree, that poorly constructed ""video"" clearly already knew what look it wanted to portray when they filmed it. I hope people have the intelligence to not just swallow that garbage whole but rather understand that homelessness is a far more complex and multi layer issue than that video showed.(edited)"
6,135497878,Caren Henderson,• Lowry,29 Jan 20,This was created by a political consulting group. Just sayin.
7,135497878,Diane Mandile,• Central Park,29 Jan 20,"But, were the interviews faked? It's definitely a complex issue. But one that many people have a blindside about"
8,135497878,Diane Mandile,• Central Park,29 Jan 20,I sometimes lower the window and hand over donation. I'm sure I'll continue to do that. For me it's the ones who look like my own kids that tug at my heart. For others it could be someone who looks like a veteran or a single parent or whatever. I don't know their story but I'm compelled to connect. I also donate through non-profit channels.  I still think this video has some lessons to share.
9,135497878,Caren Henderson,• Lowry,29 Jan 20,"My point is that the group who made this has an agenda. With election season coming up, we all should be more wary of stuff like this. I say leave it on Facebook and let NextDoor be about neighbors helping neighbors. As for the interviews - real or fake, I don’t agree with sweeping generalizations of groups of people which is what this video is trying to make - beware of all homeless people."
10,135497878,Valerie Sarni,• Beeler Park,29 Jan 20,Agree. Lets not turn nextdoor into another political bs fest like Facebook is.
11,135497878,Sadie Martin,• East Colfax,29 Jan 20,Here has been my experience with Panhandlers:
12,135497878,Cindi Mathers,• Beeler Park,1y,"Thank you for donating to reputable organizations. Quick plug here: Jackie and I volunteer at the Denver Urban Homeless Mission. I can assure you that the homeless we serve are only getting necessary items to help them get back on track like clothing, and hygiene items, shoes, backpacks etc. We still DESPERATELY need ADULT COLD WEATHER clothes, jeans and the above items. You can drop off at 9291 E 59th N Pl"
13,135497878,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,1y,"I always give cash donations directly to them. I enjoy doing it!! I gave a $10 bill to a panhandler yesterday at montview and Central Park and he picked up his backpack and walked off afterwards. Maybe that day he gets to eat or whatever he wants to do, I don't judge... and don't care what he does with it. 😁(edited)"
14,135497878,Kerri Peek,• Aurora,29 Jan 20,"Just give them food or free food coupons, not the buy one get one coupons, but free food coupons."
15,135497878,Margaux Milchen,• North Aurora/Fitzsimons,30 Jan 20,Just give them cash.
16,135497878,Kerri Peek,• Aurora,30 Jan 20,"Margaux Milchen I am a Disabled Veteran, I never have cash. If I did I would. I do end up with free food vouchers. I'm not very mobile around town, due to being blind and with a cane. So if someone looks mobile, I am more than happy to share what little I have to share. When I have cash, I give it. I was a homeless Vet for 5 years. We were fortunate to be in a motel, but there were a few months when I couldn't afford the motel and was in the streets. No I don't drink or do drugs, I'm just a Disabled Vet.  I never panhandled though.  Thought about it, but I figured people would be cruel to me and I didn't need that on top of everything else. You can't tell I am blind if you look at me. You can tell that there was facial nerve damage, my face falls."
17,135497878,Georgia Cerros,• Aurora Cultural Arts District,29 Jan 20,"Honestly, social media is the new way to panhandle. All you have to do is tell a sad story. No standing outside with a sign needed. No need to stand in line to receive food or assistance with everyone else. There are no papers to fill out. Everything you want will be delivered to your door for free and more. If you are unhappy with what you receive you can always sale it for cash. Sites like Next Door will start to become the same as seeing the homeless on the streets. It’s just one step up. It’s just a different platform. It’s smart."

The teachers at his school refused to write a recommendation letter for the program (I have gone over their head with no response from DPS) this letter would have provided these items to me for free. I have tried to pick up extra work to buy them. I have tried to find some cheaper options and I have a sensory swing but it didn’t come with hardware to hang hence the reason it was cheaper. My son also really needs a Peapod and trampoline with handle. My son really needs the Peapod because it helps with sensory input. Since he doesn’t have one and to make up for it, he either rams himself into his bed or wedges himself in between the couch cushions since my couch is really just the two squares on the floor I am left left sitting on a single square.(edited)"

2,132164645,Gloria BURNS,• East Colfax,15 Dec 19,what i did was call 311 it took me about two years i was on my own. when you live next to renters they don't get involved. i did had to call the police a few times then they see i was not going to stop finally the land lord got the ones living in the camper to go then the mechanic shop right next to my house the city got them to move. i stress so much i lost 35 lb my Doctor was worried we are living in bad times so all i can say find out where all of us can get help to not be in fear.check out the library some times a police person will give you some good suggestion if we all work together we can have some kind of peace. we can do it but not alone like i had to but one suggestion you know what you have to do is to make it very very hard for them to enter your space. wishing you the best.

4,132164645,David Heckel,• Aurora,15 Dec 19,My recommendation would be to make the space where they are camping as uncomfortable as possible.

8,132499689,Liz B.,• Westwood,19 Dec 19,Michael Hancock is scum. It’s amazing how his reputation survived this recent sex assault scandal to gain re election. And the prostitution ring scandal before that. Corruption.

16,132499689,Karen Underwood,• Berkeley-Regis,19 Dec 19,"Thank you and Merry Christmas to all of you. Be a lot merrier in Berkeley-Regis if Mayor Hancock convinced the PD to take our complaints of ""porch pirates"" seriously."
17,132499689,Wally B.,• Rosedale,19 Dec 19,"His sick Homeless Ban, helping to kill homeless citizens.  Especially bizarre since Michael was homeless himself while a young man, which he easily hides and forgets.  Sexual predator, which in itself should have ended his career.  Patrick Firman.  Have no idea what people are speaking about regarding a""living wage,""  which does not exist in Denver"
18,132499689,Amy G.,• Hutchinson Park,19 Dec 19,He has literally talked about it in campaign ads.  That isn't hiding it...
19,132499689,Wally B.,• Rosedale,19 Dec 19,"Thank you for the information Amy, which i did not know about. I am glad he finally stepped up. Now if he would truly help homeless citizens, we who work with people on the streets every day, could begin to believe his empty words."
20,132499689,Pablo P.,• Holly Hills,19 Dec 19,Can’t say Merry Christmas?
21,132499689,Robert Siefken,• Washington Park East,19 Dec 19,"Christmas is a Christian holiday - not everyone is Christian.  I imagine this wording (i.e., Seasons Greetings, Peace, Joy and Happiness) was chosen because it addresses *everyone* living in Denver."

Please do something constructive about the homeless population, getting some actual affordable housing, the thousands of dangerous potholes on our city streets, and stop building those god awful apt. complexes."
27,132499689,Jerimiah Stone,• Capitol Hill Central,19 Dec 19,Affordable housing without new apartments?! Is that an oxymoron?
0,154093690,Heidi Delancy,• Central Park,7 Jul,"Try using Revive (granular or liquid) immediately prior to fertilizing. then watering in well after. Also, use a fertilizer with a higher nitrogen content.  What is your watering schedule?"

2,154093690,EJ Vill,• Central Park,7 Jul,I used this seed in large bare spots in the spring and it worked well. I bought seed from Home Depot that didn’t sprout much at all. The new grass from the above seed is doing very well.
3,154093690,Katie Rude,• Northeast Park Hill,7 Jul,We also use revive and it has done wonders for our lawn
4,154093690,Shawn Sibert,• Clayton,7 Jul,Revive works!!! It’s also so hot and dry and hard to combat that factor...maybe try watering a little bit every day so that the lawn doesn’t stress
5,154093690,Daniel Galvagni,• North Park Hill,7 Jul,"It's summertime you're going to get brown spots. I water for 20 minutes 3 times a week, as well as fertilizer every two months. it is what it is"
6,154093690,Sal Ram,• Northeast Park Hill,7 Jul,"You mentioned it was doing well and green? did it start to turn shortly after fertilizing? You might have over fertilized, over fertilizing will burn your lawn."
7,154093690,Mary Ellen Silcott,• North Park Hill,7 Jul,"Grass seed must ALWAYS be moist. It can never dry out before germination.  If it does just once, not effective.  Revive is a good product.  But we live in a desert.  Sadly, brown spots in the lawn are typical."
8,154093690,Joe Tibben,• Central Park,7 Jul,I’ve had good luck with Revive. I use the granular but make sure you get it off of your sidewalks before watering or it will stain. Bad.
9,154093690,Dan Jeter,• Skyland,7 Jul,Does anyone have a strong opinion on watering 3x per week (~20 minutes) vs. every day for fewer minutes?
10,154093690,Daniel Galvagni,• North Park Hill,7 Jul,Jeter everything I do is perfect. Don't ever question it! Ha! 
11,154093690,Chris Koch,• South Park Hill,41w,Consider Native and low water plants as a replacement for part of your lawn.  I still have amazing green grass where I want it and have reduced my water usage by 40% https://resourcecentral.org/gardens/(edited)
12,154093690,Nicole Ryan,• East Colfax,7 Jul,Water
13,154093690,Randy Atencio,• Skyland,7 Jul,I have had better luck watering later in the evening versus early morning it doesn’t dry up with quickly
14,154093690,Jeff Walters,• Historic Montclair,7 Jul,My guess is it is Japanese Beetle larve. Watering more can just make it worse. We’ve had success with Grub B Gone.
15,154093690,Cindy Krentz,• East Colfax,8 Jul,What do the larvae look like?  Are they teeny little white things?
16,154093690,Pauline Edwards,• Skyland,7 Jul,Call True green have your soil tested 
17,154093690,Gregory Lucero,• Northeast Park Hill,41w,Hello my name is Gregory Lucero’$ I run Lucero’s landscaping and I have seen a lot of different remedies but I think you should give me a call and I can help you fix that. 7204041634(edited)
18,154093690,Penny Lehmann,• Northeast Park Hill,10 Jul,Turn the soil with a shovel to see if you have beetle larvae...they eat the grass roots! If not turning it and adding grass seed will give you a fresh start. I have also used sod to do patchwork areas for a quick fix. Zone watering seems to work the best 20 minutes
19,154093690,Karen Black,• South Park Hill,11 Jul,"Definitely check like Penny suggested. If it's beetle larvae, it's probably Japanese beetles. Do a quick google search, I can't remember the name of the spores you add to your lawn during July, but the bag is about $45 and available around town at Ace, Walmart, etc. It won't hurt your lawn, pets, or yourself, but will kill larvae."
20,154093690,Penny Lehmann,• Northeast Park Hill,11 Jul,Milky Spore is what Karen is suggesting!
21,154093690,Claire Warnes,• South Park Hill,12 Jul,Following

2,151539846,Jenifer Jasso,• Montbello,13 Jun,Thank you
0,154659538,Joy Newell,• Clayton,12 Jul,Same thing at Sams club. We ask. They yell. Threaten. We let them in. Money from ignorant assholes is more important than keeping our city safe.
1,154659538,Jerrica Zimmermann,• North Park Hill,12 Jul,"Unfortunately not surprised. Look into Bernie Marcus, the co-founder of Home Depot..."
2,154659538,Andrew Sweet,• South Park Hill,12 Jul,I wrote earlier about this issue.  HD Stock holders could force this issue but I am afraid that the CEO travels in the Republican crowd of He Who Shall Not Be Named.  The employees sonhava choices of working elsewhere but I know this is easily said from my arm chair soap box. I have switched to Lowe’s. It seems better run re masks AND the management are good on diversity issues and LGBTQ folks .  That gets my vote and my business . Let your purchases reflect your values if you can.
3,154659538,Deborah Stough,• South Park Hill,12 Jul,If people quit shopping there I bet they start enforcing it.
4,154659538,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,12 Jul,"Hi Tina I have heard many customers on ND say no mask are worn by customers but every time I’ve been there which is quite often I have never seen them let anyone in without a mask and counting as u enter. I have seen people else where not cover their nose with the mask, but it should cover ur mouth and nose admittedly it is not easy to breath in the heat. I always wear a mask and gloves"
5,154659538,Jimmye Warren,• Central Park,13 Jul,"They may not let them in without a mask, but as soon as they get inside , the mask goes in purse or pocket."
6,154659538,Melissa Jaure,• East Colfax,12 Jul,Report to 311 it’s an ordinance they will get a fine
7,154659538,Tina Hartley,• North Park Hill,12 Jul,Good to know.
8,154659538,Kathy Wright,• Skyland,16 Jul,That’s true I heard on the news that they are giving citations to those that are reported. And     One business had received one.
9,154659538,Lyndi Donley,• Skyland,12 Jul,"Went today, mask on face.  Crowded but everyone seemed to be wearing masks except for 1 family with small kids, none wearing masks.  WTF?"
10,154659538,DJ Leaderach,• Northeast Park Hill,12 Jul,Love how no maskers feel they have more rights than the rest of us. At this point they are the worst Americans.
11,154659538,Karen Kaiser,• East Colfax,12 Jul,VOTE
12,154659538,Anton Delgado,• City Park,12 Jul,If shopping Lowe's is an option shop Lowe's. HomeDepot supports and is funding Trump's campaign.
13,154659538,Tina Hartley,• North Park Hill,13 Jul,"Cofounder Bernie Marcus did donate 7 million to Trump. However, he left the company 20 years ago. So, your info as far as I can tell is not accurate,"
14,154659538,Tina Hartley,• North Park Hill,13 Jul,"I just called HD corporate at 800-466-3337 option store experience. Also, the store number is 303-320-3738 and store manager is Darrick Lansden. I have asked Corporate to respond to my request for an explanation as to why they are not refusing service to people not wearing a mask. "
15,154659538,Nick Rusciolelli,• North Park Hill,13 Jul,I’ve gotten to the point that I confront the folks that choose to put my health at risk by not wearing a mask. 
16,154659538,Aldo Covarrubias,• Clayton,13 Jul,Have you guys seen the 7-Eleven on 45th and Steele?. Between their employees not wearing masks where there is FOOD behind the counter and the taco truck (I love tacos!) outside letting people eat by them it is a hot spot for infection. I called 311 but they need more complaint in order to get something done.
17,154659538,Keegan Perkins,• Central Park,13 Jul,"When I was there a week ago, everyone was wearing masks. I didn’t see any employees not wearing masks, and they can speak for themselves on their safety. If they say they feel safer not confronting people, then that’s fine. I’m not there to force anyone to do anything. I think it’s adding to everyone’s stress to have citizen mask enforcers going around confronting people. It probably defeats the masks if you start having discussions and arguments with people, as that puts out particles you’re trying to prevent with masks. If I confront a maskless person, and they start yelling and spraying saliva, it’s only going to make it worse. I would just avoid them. That seems the best course. Giving the benefit of the doubt, there may be a reason someone is not wearing one. I’ll be fine with mine."
18,154659538,Nick Rusciolelli,• North Park Hill,13 Jul,Sounds perfectly reasonable. We’ll just have to agree to disagree on our approach.
19,154659538,Marc Duflos,• Central Park,40w,Because it's not fair to make low-wage workers enforce mask rules when they're a total lack of national and local leadership on the issue.(edited)
20,154659538,Sandy Caron,• Central Park,40w,"I called HD to ask why they make no attempt to enforce mask requirements.  They told me it was impossible to enforce and their employees were threatened by those refusing to wear a mask.  Of course many businesses are enforcing the use of masks, so really Home Depot is not making any reasonable effort. I recommend BOYCOTT HOME DEPOT - go to Ace, True Value, or Lowe’s instead.(edited)"
21,154659538,Karen Valentine,• North Park Hill,13 Jul,Agree. They are choosing not to enforce it. Path of least resistance. I’ve been to TJMaxx and Old Navy on Parker for example. Sign says it’s an expectation in order to shop in our store. I’ve watched staff remind people and offer masks to them if they want to continue to shop. Simple. Follow rules or leave.
22,154659538,Kelly Taylor,• East Colfax,13 Jul,"Hoses with some ugly color dye in it that employees can use to spray anybody coming in without a mask. Tell them it's ""disinfectant"" and that if they don't wear a mask, they have to be sprayed. HAHAHAHAHA"
23,154659538,Theresa Carrigan,• Clayton,13 Jul,VOTE.... Seriously.  It won't solve this right now but the tone of the entire country will change with a more Presidential President.
24,154659538,bob dawes,• Skyland,13 Jul,Thank you for making it political rather than personal responsibility. I care about my neighbors and the rest of the people in our country who are relying on us to at least try to keep them safe. How hard is it to wear a mask and social distance to “possible “ save one life or a person or family from the experience attached to the current situation . You can sort out the blame when everyone is safe. I only say this because I care.
25,154659538,Jeri Giachetti,• Northeast Park Hill,13 Jul,"bob dawes Theresa wasn’t making it political. It IS political. Unfortunately,"
26,154659538,Karen Valentine,• North Park Hill,40w,"Walmart is the same. I was there Saturday. Police making people have masks on while in line and that they are required for entry. I’m inside shopping and many have them pulled down around their neck, not covering their nose or otherwise just not visible at all. A clear disrespect for people, health and store policy. If you had it in line you’re playing games by removing it after you enter. Ugh 😑(edited)"
27,154659538,Randall Montano,• Northeast Park Hill,14 Jul,They'll be the people who very covid as long as you wear your mask you'll be fine
28,154659538,bob dawes,• Skyland,13 Jul,Crazy world thanks for the heads up. I will avoid HD on Quebec mainly because lawless shopping for whatever reason is something I would rather stay away from. We all have choices and I will exercise mine.
29,154659538,JJ Chris,• North Park Hill,13 Jul,I was at target in Northfield. Masks required and most are good. Signs say - due to mandatory restrictions blah blah. Someone walked right past all of that with confidence waving to employees. It was an employee!! Way to lead by example 🤬
