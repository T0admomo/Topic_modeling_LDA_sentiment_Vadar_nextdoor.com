22,180511781,Mark Kaplan,Mayfair,17 Mar,"Colorado House Bill 21-1160 that would lead to unnecessary euthanasia of adoptable animals. Neighbors ‚Äì I am posting this message to make you aware of Colorado House Bill 21-1160 that is currently in legislative committee. If the bill is enacted as currently worded it could lead to the closure of no kill shelters in Colorado and the unnecessary euthanasia of many animals that, with love and caring, are adoptable and go on to live happy and enriching lives with their families. Below is the text of a letter from Barbara Weller, the President of the Board of Directors of MaxFund Animal Adoption Center, a no kill shelter in Denver, addressing the impact of the bill. I will also provide my perspective here.

I have been a volunteer for the past three years at MaxFund, whose mission is to care for and find homes for injured and abused animals. Many of the animals taken in by MaxFund are sick or injured and, unsurprisingly, exhibit behavioral issues. MaxFund treats and rehabilitates these animals and brings them back to health. When necessary, it even provides adaptive equipment to them so that they may lead quality lives. When I started volunteering at MaxFund I primarily expected to spend time walking dogs to provide them with exercise and some time out of the shelter. While that has certainly been the case, I have seen a much more important benefit that MaxFund and its amazing staff and volunteers provide to the animals. They devote incredible energy over days, weeks and often months spending time with the animals, showing them love and compassion, and teaching them to trust people and other animals. The animals‚Äô lives are transformed and they are then able to be adopted into loving homes. 

I recently fostered a MaxFund dog for five months. She is an amazing dog but clearly had not been socialized with other animals and exhibited aggressive behavior when she saw them. Her behavior improved tremendously the more time we spent together. She ultimately was adopted by a loving family which hired a trainer to continue to work with her, and she now lives happily with them and their cat (which initially would have been impossible). In another example, one of MaxFund‚Äôs volunteers adopted a partially paralyzed dog and has spent more than a year providing physical therapy for him. A huge smile came over her face when she recently told me how her dog is now able to walk and is living a great life with her. I have experienced great joy seeing many dogs come out of their shells and go on to loving homes as a result of the mission and efforts of MaxFund and the people associated with it. More than a few adopters create Instagram accounts for their pets and we are able to continue to follow their lives. It is truly inspirational. However, if House Bill 21-1160 becomes law, MaxFund could be required to euthanize many of these animals.

Not all animal rescues have the same mission as no kill shelters like MaxFund. In Colorado, our leaders and citizens should be encouraging organizations like MaxFund and the people who support them to save helpless animals. Instead, House Bill 21-1160 would have the opposite effect.

If this is an issue that you care about, then please send an email to the bill‚Äôs sponsors and committee members expressing your view. Below is a list of their emails, as well as a link to the bill if you would like to read it. I understand that there is a committee hearing on the bill on March 22, although I do not know the time and location. I have also included a link to a petition created by one of MaxFund‚Äôs volunteers that you can sign. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Mark Kaplan

Barbara Weller Letter:
Dear MaxFund Volunteers, Staff and Supporters,

There is a Colorado legislative bill known as House Bill 21-1160 that is currently being considered in committee for enactment. This Bill pertains to all animals that enter into a Colorado shelter.

The major portion of the Bill addresses shelters adopting out ""healthy, safe and social"" animals.  This scenario is already being followed by most shelters and is regulated by PACFA.
.  
The disturbing portion of this Bill addresses those marginal, homeless pets that arrive in shelters in less than perfect condition.  These are the animals needing medical intervention, behavior modification or are simply elderly. They are our blind, deaf, paralyzed, feral, diabetic, abused
and broken cats and dogs.  These are the animals that we champion. MaxFund was founded to care for these animals and is the reason why we continue to exist to this very day.  

Passage of House Bill 21-1160 would put less than perfect animals in harm's way.  No standard criteria is found in the Bill which defines ""quality of life."" Instead of allowing shelters to provide refuge and care for these animals, it allows arbitrary decisions to be made based upon someone's subjective interpretation of an animal's quality of life. Those animals deemed lacking life's quality could be sent away or euthanized.   

We at MaxFund know better.  We see these less than perfect animals enter our shelter.  We provide them with whatever services are needed.   We watch them thrive under the care and love from our staff and foster families.  We see them blossom and, most importantly, we see them go to loving forever homes.

MaxFund and No-Kill Colorado need your action to prevent this Bill from being enacted.  Right now it is in legislative committee.  We want to stop it while it is in committee so that it is never even presented for vote.

Representatives from MaxFund and David Smyth from No-Kill Colorado will be attending a hearing of this Bill on March 22, 2021. Please contact Selina [Davison] if you are interested in attending. Between now and then we hope to inundate the Bill's sponsors and committee members with our opposition to it. 

I urge everyone to call or write to the sponsors of this Bill and to copy your objections to all its committee members.  Please also send a copy to Davyd Smith of No-Kill Colorado at info@nokillcolorado.org and to Selina at sheltermanager@maxfund.org so that we can track the strength of opposition for the March 22nd committee meeting. If you prefer calling instead, the Capitol phone number is 303 866-2583. Let Selina know that you have left a message of opposition.

27,176589826,Sara Henry,Cherry Creek North,11 Feb,"Chris Hinds Betrays Constituents. Hinds voted in favor of Group Living Zoning Amendment. He just released his ""Perfect 10"" newsletter explaining why he decided to ignore the overwhelming (80%) opposition from us pesky citizens who voted for him. His reasoning (which you can read for yourself) boiled down to his belief that all of us who opposed the measure were driven by fear, not logic. Throw in a little racism, ageism, socio economicism, fear of criminals, fear of REALLY nice developers, etc and it was his duty to overrule our will (the pesky people who voted for him).

Thus, being the superior human being that he surely is, he boldly followed nine of his colleagues forcing changes down our throats that we just don't understand we need bringing real life right to the doorsteps of our homes, schools, businesses, etc. Don't worry, pesky citizens, if things get out of hand as a result of the new Amendment, we the City Council, will immediately fix all of the problems we created just like we fix all of the other problems we've created year after year. Just look at how great we're handling the homeless crisis (cough)!!

Passage of House Bill 21-1160 would put less than perfect animals in harm's way.  No standard criteria is found in the Bill which defines ""quality of life."" Instead of allowing shelters to provide refuge and care for these animals, it allows arbitrary decisions to be made based upon someone's subjective interpretation of an animal's quality of life. Those animals deemed lacking life's quality could be sent away or euthanized.   

We at MaxFund know better.  We see these less than perfect animals enter our shelter.  We provide them with whatever services are needed.   We watch them thrive under the care and love from our staff and foster families.  We see them blossom and, most importantly, we see them go to loving forever homes.

MaxFund and No-Kill Colorado need your action to prevent this Bill from being enacted.  Right now it is in legislative committee.  We want to stop it while it is in committee so that it is never even presented for vote.

Representatives from MaxFund and David Smyth from No-Kill Colorado will be attending a hearing of this Bill on March 22, 2021. Please contact Selina [Davison] if you are interested in attending. Between now and then we hope to inundate the Bill's sponsors and committee members with our opposition to it. 

I urge everyone to call or write to the sponsors of this Bill and to copy your objections to all its committee members.  Please also send a copy to Davyd Smith of No-Kill Colorado at info@nokillcolorado.org and to Selina at sheltermanager@maxfund.org so that we can track the strength of opposition for the March 22nd committee meeting. If you prefer calling instead, the Capitol phone number is 303 866-2583. Let Selina know that you have left a message of opposition.

Hi all! We just dropped off the coats (for him and Lilith) a tent, sleeping bag, and a few extra cold weather items for him. He was surrounded by bags!!! Our neighbors are truly wonderful. Chris shared that he could really use a very heavy duty backpack (think army style), boots size 11.5, and possibly a wagon to carry his things. He is so touched by all of the help from the community. I know I have passed by so many times and I‚Äôm glad I finally stopped to help. A little kindness goes a long way. 

I will be bringing him some Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow, and will hopefully talk some more about longer term needs. He would like to find some consistent housing so if anyone knows of someone renting out a room/basement, that would be a huge step!

52,169410487,Timothy Carter,Hale,1 Dec,"Denver Homeless Out Loud. On December 15th and 16th, 2020, Federal District 10 Judge Martinez will be hearing our case against the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for violating constitutional rights by sweeping people without homes and with nowhere to go - even in a global pandemic. This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housing - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, ‚ÄúThe CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.‚Äù 

On top of this the suit addresses that, ‚ÄúOver the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (‚Äúto where?‚Äù is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).‚Äù The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can‚Äôt afford housing during this pandemic. 

Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that ‚Äúwhen I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.‚Äù Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time. 

Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. There will be a call-in number where the public can listen to the hearing. Stay tuned for this number. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to the hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place. 

Documentation of full lawsuit is publicly available.

He lost his job in March because of COVID 19 and lost his housing . 
Thank you

Update: I just spoke to David , he said the only thing he would be grateful for is food and water and if anybody would like to bring him a warm meal occasionally he would love that he said, apparently a neighbor brought him some rice and beans one night and his face lid up talking about it and how delicious that was .  He said he wants to keep his belonging simple because the less he has the less vulnerable he feels , he‚Äôs had other homeless steal some shoes of his feet in the night and someone actually stole his sleeping bag while sleeping in it . 
He says he‚Äôs adjusted to the cold and feels content with what he has for the time being. He‚Äôs grateful he‚Äôs been allowed to hang out at congress park , feels pretty safe there , and would rather not bring to much attention to himself so he‚Äôs not asked to leave right now .

107,162282386,Sara Henry,Cherry Creek North,23 Sep,"Email to Chris Hinds re: Group Living Zoning Amendment. Hello Teresa:

As Chris and your office is well aware, the talk of the town and certainly the district that Chris represents is consumed with the proposed changes to the zoning laws that will effect almost all (not the lucky/privileged 20% that will be excluded) of our neighborhoods.  The overwhelming majority of the people with whom I‚Äôve spoken and as evidenced by the vast majority of opinions of the public, object to every aspect of the proposed changes as written as being beyond grossly excessive, prejudicial and dangerous to our communities.  Many of the voters/citizens are absolutely willing to accept and support some of the changes that are reasonable, but the proposal as written is simply obscene.

I was unable to attend the recent Zoom meeting hosted by Chris so I reached out via Nextdoor to ask which council members have publicly stated their positions in regards to the zoning changes.  The response I received is that Chris is in favor of the entirety of the zoning changes as presented.

Will you please tell us in writing where Chris stands on the most important issue that will affect our neighborhoods for years to come?  Is he: 1) in favor of all of the proposed changes in their entirety; 2) in favor of some of the changes, and if so, which portion of the changes does he support/oppose and why; 3) in favor of delaying all of the proposed changes so further community input/evaluations can be made; or 4) in favor of allowing the citizens of Denver to vote on such a life-altering critical issue?

Please provide us with a written response so that I can post Chris‚Äôs position on Nextdoor.  The fact that this late in the game we are unsure of where our Denver City Council members presently stand on this issue is grossly unfair to the public that elected them.

I feel like I need to address a few things: Kathleen Lamb is not an ordinary homeless person. She has a home and a bed, and she has two beautiful girls that she loves. For the last ten years Kat has struggled with mental health issues. She had a severe breakdown this summer, and she has been in and out of psychosis. She was on a 72 hour hold and then was released to the Springs Rescue Mission, without the hospital ever speaking to me or to her case manager or to her therapist or doctor!!!. She did not want to come home. She said she had access to care. She had access to programs and she actually seemed to be thriving. We went down on Sunday to see her and to meet her boyfriend who is working and trying to get them into a better situation. In the last week and a half she began to decompensate. She still seemed okay the last time I spoke to her on duo. She can decompensate within hours, which we believe is what happened. We don‚Äôt know if she wandered off and was picked up or if she left with someone but she left her bag, her purse and her phone behind. She never leaves her phone. Not even in her worst condition. She also often carries her purse, even in this condition. The only thing missing is her wallet. And she has not used her cash card that I monitor since Monday. Our mental health system is so broken I have no words. They have made privacy laws so stringent that they put the responsibility of care with the person least capable of even caring for themselves. She does not have a street name. She is NOT your ordinary homeless person. She has friends and she has family who love her more than words can show.",0,Homeless,396

149,158387521,Jean Greenwood,Hilltop,17 Aug,"Oppose Amending Group Living Code. I am opposed to the zoning change to increase density in Denver neighborhoods. Instead of working with developers, city planners and lenders to build more affordable housing, some members of the City council have expressed support for the lazy option of just cramming more people into existing homes. This zoning change has the potential to ruin existing single-family neighborhoods. The amendment would increase the number of unrelated adults who can live together to eight or more. Individual family homes could be turned into boarding houses for week-to week and month-to-month renters. Properties could be turned into group living facilities for the homeless, community corrections (halfway houses) and special care. As the number of residents‚Äô increase, so does the number of cars, noise, overcrowding and safety problems.   
What is behind this zoning change? In a word, money. It has been reported that many of the Group Living Advisory Committee (GLAC) members have ties to for-profit group living businesses and organizations. These for-profit groups are not concerned about Denver neighborhoods. Instead their motivation is increasing the number of people landlords can legally charge rent to. Measures comparable to what GLAC is proposing has been passed in other cities. In those cities, single-family homes were purchased by investors who turned them into dormitory-like dwellings and group living facilities. And what was the result in these cities? Neighborhoods were ruined as renters moved in and homeowners moved out.
Members of the Denver council have a choice to make. Are you going to protect single-family neighborhoods or ruin them? Are you going to stand with Denver homeowners or investors? Do the right thing and vote to not amend the Group Living Code.

(Prior Post) Denver weighs code changes allowing up to 5 unrelated people to live together, expanding halfway house sites
The Denver City Council is considering several code changes to help those in need of affordable housing and different types of residential care, though some feel strongly the issues should wait or be shot down entirely.

The first change would allow up to five unrelated people to live together in the same home, said Andrew Webb, senior city planner. And the second would expand the number of places where residential care facilities ‚Äî like nursing homes and community corrections facilities ‚Äî can be located.

163,160572160,Sara Henry,Cherry Creek North,6 Sep,"Denver Group Living Change.org Petition. I received an email tonight setting forth details of various city council members' concerns about the rapid push to implement changes to the zoning code allowing up to 10 unrelated individuals and  an unlimited number of their relatives to live in the same home. I was heartened to see numerous council members push back and ask numerous pointed questions of the planning department.  Their concerns included: not enough time/input from the community especially during Covid, not enough analysis on whether this would actually hurt neighborhoods of color/low income, outside commercial interests pushing this to make more money, acknowledgment that literally there would be no cap on the number of people in one residence, 90% of public input thus far opposes the zoning change, exemptions will granted to about 25% of Denver areas forcing other areas to absorb more of the impact, etc. Bravo to the council members asking these critical questions before this kind of massive change is shoved down almost all of our throats without giving the voters/citizens of Denver the right to vote on such a life-impacting issue!!

The notifications I'm receiving with these updates from Change.org keeps asking for donations to further the fight against this zoning change. Does anyone know where the money goes that's donated? I never donate to a cause unless I know who's getting that money and how it'll be spent. If anyone can answer this question I'd appreciate hearing from you.",2,Homeless,270

167,158127610,Nancy Bell,Hilltop,14 Aug,"I wanted to share this letter. Councilman Kashmann: 

For forty-seven years I have made my home in Denver after returning from service in Vietnam. I was attracted to living in Denver because it had a renowned reputation for excellent neighborhood communities and spirit.  I chose Congress Park as the neighborhood in which to live and raise my family, opting to send all three of our children to Denver Public Schools. I volunteered for years on the soccer fields, in the schools, in neighborhood organizations  and in my downtown place of worship.  While we as a family, and I as a practicing lawyer for over forty-four years, assisted those who struggled in our community to meet basic human needs, we felt safe and took pride in neighborhood activities.  I moved to University Park fifteen years ago, when I needed to find a wheelchair accessible home for my daughter (a housing need not addressed or met by Denver's leadership) ; I have continued neighborhood participation and have run for office twice for the University Park area.  

I am therefore appalled and outraged by Denver City Council's apparent effort to disregard the efforts of homeowners and citizens to improve their neighborhoods and develop neighborhood spirit and cohesiveness - open to persons of all racial, ethnic, sexual preferences and social backgrounds, etc  - by undermining the desire of all homeowners to live and raise families in safe, open and livable space, by destroying reasonable density and property use zoning with Group Living mandates.  I was raised in the city of Philadelphia, have lived in a number of high density cities on the East and West Coast, and chose to move to Denver to put those less than desirable experiences behind me.  There is no reason or justification to implant Group Homes with more than three unrelated persons - and their relatives - or Community Corrections half way housing or drug rehab facilities in neighborhoods where young children, play, ride their bikes and walk to school.  As a defense attorney, I have first hand knowledge of the unsafe conditions that attend half way houses and drug rehab centers. No Denver resident should be unaware of the issues posed by current un-monitored ""camp sites"" in family centered neighborhoods, with attendant drug use, crime and health issues.  At the same time, certain City Council politicians seek to defund the police and offer us the chaos and vandalism of downtown Denver; shame on them !   

The Group Home approach reflects a lazy, non creative, and foolish approach to issues that demand intellect and commonsense - spread the problem and pander to certain ideologues and constituents, while doing nothing to address the mental illness, drug abuse, and hopelessness of those on the streets, or cramming more people into homes and neighborhoods where the infrastructure is lacking and the likelihood of those people becoming part of the community is next to nil.  Denver is large enough to implement creative housing options and ""campsites"" that offer basic services and security, without trashing existing neighborhoods. Do citizens really want the unsafe and unhealthy circumstances of Civic Center Park and the downtown Denver Library to be superimposed on our safe neighborhoods? A resounding NO is the answer. 

Councilman Kashmann - represent your constituents and stop cowering to the radicals on City Council that are spearheading this destructive effort, that will lead to families leaving the City for safer neighborhoods. I will look for your leadership in the days ahead.

I am starting this thread for a woman named Jan that responded to NEXTDOOR a couple of weeks ago expressing need for help but little detail. After pursuing that sub-posting and meeting her, I feel she merits some short term help. Although I encouraged her to write her own thread, she felt the potential of extensive response would be overwhelming. I have her consent to inform you about her needs. In short, she is middle aged and single with no family, disabled with a service dog, recovering from surgery, resumed work after 5 months unemployed due to pandemic, resourceful and humble. Her disability involves degenerative disk disease so lifting of weight is difficult.

Her immediate needs are basic including replenishment of food supply, sundries, auto gas, utilities, and a few new clothing items due to long unemployment which precipitated substantial weight loss. Most of this she would prefer to obtain at Walmart due to modest prices. Walmart gift cards or cash would see these needs.

In addition to her paid work, she sells some items on line such as clothing, purses, unopened facial creams, small household and garage items with limited weight. She is open to these donations. Unsold items are subsequently donated.

Her other needs include a referral for a Therapist that takes MEDICAID as she is sometimes able to pay the difference in rates. She would need talk therapy for depression. Her face also lit up with the mention of the last item which would be a message with a professional able to accommodate her spinal condition. This might need to wait for the pandemic to subside around summertime as she is being quite careful.

Any help as described, that you may provide would be greatly appreciated. You may also text message me at 612 666 5972 as that would be easier than following the thread on this site.

Hello my fellow Denver neighbors. I am posting as a final effort to reach out before my family faces homelessness on June 1st. If you or someone you know has a 3 bedroom house/condo/duplex for rent, or any resources for a family in need of permanent shelter, that I have monthly income to pay for, please, please contact me through Nextdoor or email munepenny@gmail.com.

I am a single mom of two boys and we have two trained and friendly adult female Great Danes, one is eldery. We have been living in rental homes for years, but due to the pandemic, we are struggling to find a home that fits us all within my $2K-$2,500/mo budget for rent. Our lease is up in our current home near Lindsley Park, and we have had several applications I've put in this month denied. Some of you may recognize me from Nextdoor as your neighbor, or your Nanny, or your trusted dogsitter and housesitter. I have been active in our community in all these roles, and have strong neighborhood references to back me up.

I have congestive heart failure from the open heart surgery I received in 2015 to replace the aortic valve in my heart and save my life. I am disabled, however, thanks to the support of my boys Evan-15 and Noah-11, I lead a modified yet active and fulfilling life with them and our girls (the Danes). My oldest son is a bike mechanic that has been active in our community as well, having fixed up donated bikes to resell, or provide tune ups and repairs to our neighborhood. My youngest son is an avid and talented artist and performs the brunt of our household chores, from dishes to picking up poop on a daily basis, he keeps our household neat and tidy. I am in digital marketing sales and work remotely from home as a self contracted employee for 6 months until I am hired on permanently. The three of us function like a well oiled machine, we are a tight and unified family unit.

Here's why we have been denied applications for rental homes this month. My credit is shot due to recent divorce, from an abusive and alcoholic ex husband who wouldn't work, my boys' father. We left him and his dysfunctional family in Dallas and moved to Denver, where I grew up, to start a fresh life for ourselves. Also, even though we have strong rental, personal and pet references, landlords are concerned that we are not a two adult income household and/or they do not allow large dogs. I have also been denied because of my health issues and recent job changes, due to the pandemic, these past few months. Even though I don't look as good on paper as other applicants, I was hoping to find a decent human who would extend some faith and trust in my little family, I have income, and I have first month's rent and security deposit ready to go, if someone would just give us a chance. Thanks for reading, and I hope someone can provide some information or assistance to us before it is too late.",0,Homeless,748

203,157268079,Nancy Bell,Hilltop,6 Aug,"Community Corrections-Group Living. From Florence Sebern:
Jane Prancan, 17-year member of the Denver Community Corrections Board, answered some questions and commented about the Group Living Zoning Code Amendment and it's connection to Denver Community Corrections.

Q&A with Jane Prancan, August 3, 2020

Q: Can the business model for Denver community corrections accept candidates from other jurisdictions?  
A: Yes, candidates can be accepted from any jurisdiction in Colorado ‚Äì referrals from both the Department of Corrections and Judicial Department (probation).

Q: Do persons eligible for community corrections within Denver limits need to be Denverites?  
A: No, they can be from any jurisdiction in the state.

Q: Can the community corrections business model that steps into the GEO/CoreCivic void, grow beyond what is needed to serve our Denver system?  
A: There is no limit to the number of clients in any facility except zoning and the ability to receive reimbursement from the State for each client.

Council members are leading the effort to create community corrections in small houses in neighborhoods with little to no supervision. They claim that all community corrections clients are simply low level drug offenders.  I might note that no City Council member has ever attended a community corrections meeting.

Low level drug offenders present certain challenges, but community corrections does not place only low level drug offenders.

Thus far, at the four Community Corrections meetings in July 2020, following is the breakdown of sentencing crimes for offenders reviewed. Crimes vary from month to month. This list is typical of the cases reviewed.  It is also important to note that every one of the offenders referred has a lengthy criminal background including misdemeanors and felonies.
‚Ä¢ Assault-usually 2nd degree ‚Äì 21
‚Ä¢ Dangerous drugs-manufacture/sale ‚Äì 10
‚Ä¢ Menacing ‚Äì 8
‚Ä¢ Homicide ‚Äì 4
‚Ä¢ Aggravated robbery (usually with a weapon) ‚Äì 15
‚Ä¢ Aggravated motor vehicle theft (carjacking) ‚Äì 5
‚Ä¢ Vehicular assault ‚Äì 2
‚Ä¢ Child abuse ‚Äì 1
‚Ä¢ Sex offense ‚Äì 5
‚Ä¢ Kidnapping ‚Äì 2
‚Ä¢ Weapons ‚Äì 5
‚Ä¢ Others including identity theft, extortion, fraud, dangerous drugs, stalking, organized crime (usually gang related) forgery and trespass (often domestic violence) ‚Äì 17

The numbers, above, are for individual offenders and the crime of conviction that resulted in each one being sentenced to the Department of Corrections. Many persons have multiple offenses, for example: a person convicted of armed robbery will also have additional charges for unlawful possession of weapons; kidnapping is often accompanied by assault charges.

I have long been a supporter of Community Corrections and worked with communities to assure safety for the neighborhoods.  Now encouraging violent offenders with little to no supervision and few services is troubling.  This new effort is of great concern to me.""

The Denver Community Corrections Board oversees the acceptance and rejection criteria for all offenders considered for placement in the Denver Community Corrections Residential program.

Board responsibilities include reviewing all matters relating to Community Corrections and when appropriate, advising the city on actions to be taken.

What I strongly suspect has happened is that the land zoned for halfway houses was taken over by developers in areas, such as LoHi.  So now rather than plan for the displacement of halfway houses and save some land for the halfway houses in land zoned for that, the developers took all sites away. So the City‚Äôs great solution? Rezone residential areas and fill neighborhoods with people on probation, create safety risks, and degrade home values.  People in halfway houses are on probation; they have not, as Webb claims, paid their debt to society.  Rather they have been released early, so that they can attempt to prove that they can function safely in society.   They have not proved that they deserve to live wherever they want, despite Andrew Webb‚Äôs claim that this is equity.  And notice how the recidivism rate is never discussed.  As with most things currently underway in our city with this administration, follow the money.  The money was in pushing halfway houses out of LOHI to allow large scale redevelopment.

I'm 76 so I pretty much need to observe.  I just dropped off a UPS return at the store on 700 Colo. Blvd.  I saw that an extreme minimum of the distancing guidelines are being observed there. The lobby is very small so there's an absolute minimum of space for 6' distancing, clerks are not wearing masks and there are no other forms of barriers, and, a steady stream of observing and non-observing customers are coming in one after the other.  This caught my attention because I've been to many other local businesses that are doing a good job of keeping their customers safe and it's much appreciated.  In those stores, you can at least assume that they try to clean and disinfect regularly.  However, in this UPS store, I got no such feeling and they deal with a lot of customers each day.

From Gail Skyes, with permission. To
City Council members, Mayor Hancock and Andrew Webb,

I listened to Wednesday‚Äôs presentation by Andrew Webb regarding the recommended changes to Denver‚Äôs Group Living Zoning, and I want to express my strong concerns and opposition to what is happening.   

The Committee has lumped together so many major changes in to this proposal that citizens cannot intelligently consider what the overall impact will be to our city. 

The Committee says new zoning regulations will ‚Äúsimplify‚Äù the Zoning code for the city. This is blatantly untrue.  It will, in fact, create a quagmire for citizens and make it impossible for us to address our neighborhood‚Äôs needs. 

The proposed zoning changes push enforcement and monitoring of zoning regulations on to the citizens while absolving the city zoning agencies of any responsibility for the effects of the changes.  Citizens have been told we can call 311 or the police for help on violations. 

What involved citizens are hearing and being sensitive to is what affects them - not the holistic body of changes being proposed and what this re-zoning proposal ultimately means for our communities.   

Some people are concerned that the current definition of unrelated adults and their families is discriminatory to the LGBTQ community and that it does not recognize current societal norms or desire for communal living. 
They support the zoning proposal.

Older people are threatened by all of the changes at once, particularly with all of the neighborhood issues we are already facing each and every day, without government support.
They do not support the zoning proposal.

Homeowners and neighborhood communities are rightfully concerned about overcrowding, residential care facilities, homeless shelters, and prison facilities in the neighborhoods without clear and defined rules regarding density, proximity to schools and community gathering places , 
They do not support the recommended changes. 

Many people support pieces of the bill, but we cannot currently consider or support them separately.  I believe this is exactly what the special interests driving this initiative want - chaos, ignorance and apathy that will ensure approval of their initiative without allowing citizens to address each piece intelligently. This feels very much like what is happening to citizens on a national level, and is flat out wrong. 

The ‚Äúdata‚Äù, as we are consistently hearing from the Committee, is that it's good (!) for our neighborhoods  to encourage:  Severe overcrowding of single family residences without bathroom or minimum square footage requirements; unregulated and unlicensed halfway houses, residential care, nursing, rehab and correctional facilities without regard for children and home owners‚Äô well being; and expanded congregate living (rent by the room).  

Let me simplify - the Committee is paving the way for:  overcrowding of neighborhoods and public services for the enrichment of landlords and real estate speculators, profiting by private investors for the unregulated care of our most vulnerable citizens needing nursing and rehabilitation services, price gouging and profiting by investors of private prison expansion (that WE tax payers will also be paying for) and, of course,  Air B&B. 

And for all of this ‚Äúprogress‚Äù under the guise of ‚Äúaffordable housing and helping the homeless‚Äù,  we tax payers and citizens who have built these desirable neighborhoods to live in get to monitor and deal with the inevitable abuses and problems that will result. 

A selling point for the Committee is that  Seattle, Portland, Washington DC and other cities have this progressive model in place and it‚Äôs the way to go for Denver.  This conclusion is based on naivety and / or stupidity. Denver is not those cities nor do we want to be. 

In response to safety concerns voiced by citizens, Mr. Webb stated that city code requires sprinklers and other safety installations.  Therefore, we can be assured that domiciles under the new zoning proposal will conform to safety and fire codes.  

These building codes apply to new build, not to existing structures.  Old domiciles will not need to update and conform, just as current homeowners are ‚Äúgrandfathered‚Äù in on other unsafe situations such as illegal apartments that don‚Äôt meet current zoning requirements.    

Most of the rentals in my neighborhood have out of state owners who contribute directly to speculative housing price increases, do not care for the properties they own, and do not contribute one thing to our neighborhoods or the fabric of our community.  Why are we continuing to encourage more of this type of investment at the expense of our citizens?

WE are the economic base for Denver city initiatives.  WE are the fabric that holds community together and makes Denver a city that people of all ages want to live in.  WE are Denver residents. 
Ignoring our concerns and lumping everything the Committee has proposed under one umbrella is unconscionable.

Council representatives and mayor Hancock, I ask that you do the right thing for Denver and it‚Äôs citizens, and reject the Committee‚Äôs rezoning proposal. 

Respectfully,

Gail Sykes

A Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) request was made to Community Planning and Development (CPD) for contracts related to the Group Living Zoning Code Amendment. A request was also made to the City Clerk, custodian of contracts.
A contract and amendments for Athena Group and Meagan Picard were produced. Athena Group (Washington state LLC) and Meagan Picard (non-Denver resident) were paid to influence Denver policy and code, at a cost of $45,097.
Ms. Picard was the facilitator of in-person and ZOOM meetings and produced all of the meeting summaries. She provided protocols for meetings and process, including how decisions were made; communications and public involvement in the process; approach to drafting the zoning updates.
The first sentences in the first paragraph of the original contract's Exhibit A confirms the real priorities of the proposal:
""A 2008 moratorium on new Community Corrections Facilities will expire in May of 2018. A public discussion of the current regulations is needed to identify any changes before the Community Corrections Facilities moratorium expires. Concurrently, other City and nonprofit organization efforts to address homelessness have highlighted other possible shortcomings in related sections of the Denver Zoning Code pertaining to shelter and group living uses.""
CPD community presentations emphasized the household definition and number of unrelated/per household. The larger priorities of this proposal -- allowing community corrections and homeless shelters in every single-family neighborhood -- were obscured.

With the year end approaching, I want to make everyone aware of Energy Outreach Colorado, where I am a member of the board.  EOC is a nonprofit organization with the mission of making sure that all Coloradans can afford their energy needs.  We work extensively with the State of Colorado and all major utilities around the state.

In this pandemic year, more Coloradans are struggling financially and help with their energy costs can make a big difference in their lives and, in many cases, keep a family from homelessness.  If you are struggling with your energy bills this winter, please visit the EOC website (www.energyoutreach.org) to see if you might qualify for assistance. 

If you are fortunate enough to be in a position to help your neighbors with their energy costs, I would ask you to consider EOC in your year-end giving.  Colorado Gives Day is coming on December 8th, and that‚Äôs a great way to donate, or you can donate directly on the EOC website.  We‚Äôre also listed on Amazon Smile, and if you can select us there, Amazon will make a small donation with each of your purchases.

The City and County of Denver also supports four community vaccination sites to ensure residents in vulnerable communities have easy access to the vaccine. Residents ages 18 and over can call 720-865-3005 for information about dates, times, and registration requirements. 

There are also many resources available online and by phone to help you find an appointment or get on a waitlist for providers in your area. Sites like www.vaccinefinder.org and www.vaccinespotter.org/CO/ are up-to-date tools that help you track down COVID-19 vaccine appointment openings, and providers like Kroger, Safeway, CVS, and Walgreens all have appointment systems of their own.  

Find more information about vaccine options in Denver at www.denvergov.org/Government/COVID-19-Information/Vaccination 

... I can‚Äôt leave my home for medical reasons.

The Denver Department of Public Health and Environment offers at-home vaccination for people who can't leave their homes. For more information on how to get this service, visit our website or call the DDPHE at 720-865-3005 and press option 4. 

... I don‚Äôt have a ride.

If you lack access to transportation, call Mile High United Way‚Äôs 2-1-1 help center. Mile High United Way and Lyft have partnered to help Denver residents get to their non-emergency vaccine appointments.  

If you have a disability that keeps you from using regular mass transit services, find out more about RTD‚Äôs Access-A-Ride program by visiting www.rtd-denver.com/services/access-a-ride.  

... I need childcare.

Mile High United Way connects residents to childcare for those who need it. Call 2-1-1 for more information. 

... I have a health condition and I‚Äôm afraid the vaccine could make me sick.

According to the CDC, most people with underlying health issues can safely take the vaccine. If you are worried, talk to your doctor. 

... I am undocumented.

You do not have to be a documented citizen to get a vaccine. Providers may ask for ID or insurance information at your vaccine appointment. These documents ARE NOT required to get your shot. You will not be turned away for not having these documents. 

... I have a language barrier.

The City of Denver‚Äôs community vaccine sites provide language support for a variety of languages, as do many other vaccine providers in the community.  

... I am afraid of needles.

Understandable! Healthcare providers are trained to make the vaccine shot as painless as possible. Don‚Äôt let your fears keep you from getting this lifesaving vaccine! 

... I have concerns about effectiveness.

The COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in preventing infection. All vaccines available in the U.S. are nearly 100% effective in preventing serious illness and death related to the virus.

Getting everyone vaccinated is the most important thing right now. Our community vaccine sites have been set up to serve the ZIP codes in Denver hardest hit by the pandemic, and the city and the state are working hard to ensure that the vaccine is reaching vulnerable and marginalized people, including people experiencing homelessness and who are incarcerated.",2,Homeless,706

I have known Jeff from taking my cars into him when he worked at a Michelin place on Bannock St. in the late 70's.  Jeff then worked for Jim Paris at the current location and bought it many years ago.  He has stayed open and applied for a small business loan as soon as they were available but still was too late as the money ran out.  There is not a more honest, personable, capable, person out there, no matter what you think of your person.  One time I had an issue with some part and it was out of warranty.

Please support your local independent business person and not the chains.

This is truly an unprecedented time. I was wrong. Like many people in healthcare, I scoffed at those taking this now pandemic so seriously when it seemed like the flu is serious every year and we can't even get people to get their flu shot or wash their hands. We were given tables of data showing how the flu has a higher mortality rate and initially looked at this like it was just another thing. But now it is very clear that this is not going away. And it has the potential to completely overwhelm our healthcare system. I don't say any of this to encourage or condone panic. Panic and hoarding is the last thing that anyone should do. Let's all come together and help the most vulnerable among us.

Starting tomorrow 3/16 we will deliver any prescriptions for free. We will work with your insurance company to get longer day supplies if needed. We will be posting on social media whenever we get vital supplies in like hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies. And we would like to coordinate volunteers for grocery shopping for folks that need it. We will regularly wipe down all surfaces at the pharmacy and do our best to keep it as safe as possible. What else can we do for you Congress Park??? Tell us the need and let's all solve it together.

I'm already aware of one need. For doctors, pharmacists, nurses, etc....anyone on the front lines....we need help with our kids. And we can't have a ton of kids at one place because that defeats the purpose of social distancing to flatten the curve. So if you have a neighbor that's a first responder that has to go to work, and you yourself are not a vulnerable population, offer to help that family. This is a vital contribution you could be making if you are not able to work and are healthy. How else can we all think to help?? I'm so interested to hear your responses. And please, feel free to call and ask for help. I have so many wonderful patients that want to help others. We can connect people with the resources they need.

Some people might presume that many of the people who are out on the streets are there because they were criminals, pedophiles, addicts - or at least maybe anti-social, and based on that might oppose a fenced Safe Outdoor Space tent village in our neighborhood. Of course! Mostly they‚Äôre pretty regular folks, though, it turns out.

Our nation used to have a different economic and social framework than we have today. One of the social support structures that our forebears had were their Churches. God bless PHUMC for stepping up to re-take that role.  So far, churches have been the only landowners to offer usable land for Safe Outdoor Spaces to move people off the street curbs.

Regarding S.O.S.s: The difference between the improvement of moving from an apartment into your first house does not remotely compare to the improvement of moving from a tent on a city street-curb, into a tent within a fenced-in enclosure of a church parking lot with san-o-lets, trash service, social structure, electricity, and no fear of having your base ‚Äúswept‚Äù away by city cleaning crews any random day. An S.O.S is still minimal, but is a haven of peace to people who need a haven of peace. 

A precedent: The S.O.S. in the church lot on 16th and Pearl was already built before they decided that they were going to invite everyone from what I saw as the wild filthy crazy ‚Äúun-sanctioned‚Äù camp across the street, to move into the new S.O.S. It‚Äôs what I think a Jesus would have done, but still I expected disaster. (And I was one of the volunteers!) Yet when I visited it two weeks later, and multiple times since, it is a Haven of Peace. There are one or two bright bold larger than life characters, but there is peace and security, and there is healing and grace. It is managed by a firm and loving staff and appreciated by grateful campers.

I do not think the larger neighborhood will be impacted for the worse by this camp. (Note there are background checks because of the nearby day-care, too.) I hope they will be surprised to find that the lot has been transformed into something more humanely beautiful and somehow more tranquil than a barren asphalt lot. And it is only for six months.

Kids can still play. Children have agile perception. Teach kids to be wary, but not afraid. That‚Äôs how I grew up and I feel my life is richer, for it.

These people who will stay in an S.O.S. aren‚Äôt the dregs that a ‚Äúworst-case‚Äù mindset imagines; and we need to do something better than what has been done until now for our fellow humans.  I am proud of this church, and of Park Hill, for stepping up, and I hope that we can crow to the rest of the city: This is what Park Hill does, and you can, too.

(And if it turns out it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúall that‚Äù, we can adjust things!)",2,Homeless,610

I was  literally floored and became sick to my stomach once I heard the news that 
Was just presented to me by a friend.  Honestly  I can‚Äôt see how this location would be considered an appropriate location for housing homeless population.  This was apparently approved ‚Äúunder the radar‚Äù and was in the works without many knowing about it!  Question:  Who is going to police this and keep our children‚Äôs safety top priority? Who is going to keep the area sanitized and clean of debris that we already see all over the city where these tent cities currently exist?  Not to mention our property values will likely diminish as a result of this horrible decision.. I am all for finding an appropriate location to house our homeless population, but as a tax payer it would have been nice to have had a say in the decision, but instead it was pushed through under the radar!  I mean really, smack dab in the middle of our established neighborhood that is literally a block from our public library and grade school? This is the ‚ÄúWrong‚Äù location and the ‚ÄúWrong‚Äù decision by our state and local authorities.  Ultimately This will present a major safety issue for our neighbors  and our children, and is a very very bad thing for North Parkhill overall..  Something needs to be done to stop this atrocity!

334,180920051,Laura Avant,Northeast Park Hill,21 Mar,"Save me from myself! I am absolutely not proud about getting good warm clothing to the homeless.  I have been known to raid abandoned homeless camps for clothing to take home to wash and dry and donate to the shelters.  But these last two weeks really took the honors for OCD clothes gathering.  I was down at St. Francis Center giving out  handmade hats and scarves from Knitting for Peace when I noticed a lot of clothing on the ground, in the gutter, and under snow and trash.  I did as an OCD social worker would do and picked them up, put them in my car and took them home.  The items I got last week were washed and dried, folded and sorted and taken to the two shelters I donate to.  
Then Friday I did the same thing again but intended to get it all back to the people there before the snow started and give it directly to them.  I didn't make my own deadline so the two bags are still here while a sleeping bag hangs over the shower curtain.

I would so much rather deal with the nice, clean stylish and warm donations that this community has been offering me, but my donations have dried up lately.  If you can save me from this ridiculous practice of resurrecting dirty abandoned clothing by donating, please do.    I am attaching photos of the latest OCD bags ready to be washed.  

One of the reasons for the unending need for clothing is that COVID has halted the laundry trucks that used to make stops at various homeless areas for people to hand in dirty clothes to be washed and dried and returned to them.  Now when things get dirty or wet, they have no recourse for washing them.  I certainly can't afford the laundry products, hot water, and gas to go down town all the time on my social security, but I would gladly  take cash donations so I can continue to ""resurrect"" these things.  Then I could go to a big laundromat and wash a lot at once.  As with your donations, you may PM me, email me or call at 303-316-6748 to arrange for delivery or pick up.

On the other hand, take a look through your closet and drawers to find clothing or household items to donate (Samaritan House gives household items to families leaving the shelter.) and let me know.  I'll get my OCD self to your place or welcome you here.",0,Homeless,456

My dog Lucy and I went for a walk this morning in the Art's District and it still looks pretty good.  However, I was struck by s liquor store at Florence St and Colfax.  Volunteers cleaned up the area in front and across the street from the liquor store, and we must have picked up 30 empty shot or 1/5 bottles.  This morning there was just as many empty bottles.  I noticed the store opens at 8:00 each day, and customers are pouring in there, and some are throwing out empty bottles almost immediately.

Do not kick or beat an animal it's not only cruel it doesn't help the pet behave it only makes their behavior worse. They need lots of excercise just like kids. Do not dump your pet on the street there are so many organizations to take your pet if that's the only solution. If a neighbor sees you abusing your dog or cat and calls the police you will be charged with a felony! For good reason. If there are children who witness the abuse you could be charged with child abuse. It's not ok. Seek help! Pet owners understand the frustration of being a pet parent. It can be very tough.

The Denver City Council will hold a public hearing and vote next week on the final proposal to modernize rules that govern residential uses in the Denver Zoning Code. The proposed text amendment package would give residents more housing options and providers more flexibility to address the needs of vulnerable communities. It also fixes outdated and confusing language, and addresses long-standing equity gaps in the city's zoning code. The final proposal is the result of three years of work and reflects thoughtful compromise from all sides after months of thorough review by the public, the Denver Planning Board and council members.

Maybe cuz I have always thought people without housing are just as good as anyone, as me or cuz I was homeless for a few months.  I am not sure. I just do. 

I have volunteered, mostly at the Network Coffeehouse when John Hicks was alive, a small program connected to the then Legal Center for People with Disabilities, but they changed their name to Disability Law Colorado.

I have successfully completed a big and emotionally exhausting project. I was out all day last Friday and was able to distribute these items and lend a helping hand to a few cold folks. 
THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE DONATIONS FROM MY AMAZING NEIGHBORS!! With the money I purchased dozens of emergency blankets and received clothing donations like gloves, hats, blankets, as well as some hot tea containers which I filled up and gave out. 

 Jay blanket and gloves 

Mercedes blanket and tampons and a ride to a friends place

3 emergency blankets to 3 tentless friends sleeping on the sidewalk

A few dozen emergency blankets to tent camps

A donated coffee to a man who was sleeping on the corner 

Harrison - ride to the shelter, emergency blankets and a friend to talk to through the process of sobriety

Emergency sleeping bag for a man who didn‚Äôt want to go to the shelter and was on the sidewalk in -2 degree weather

Gloves and blanket to Priest (that‚Äôs his name)

380,181569351,Laura Avant,Northeast Park Hill,27 Mar,"Laundry for the homeless Monday morning, 3/29. I just raided a homeless encampment again on Friday to gather clothing to sort and wash.  Almost no one was there, but there were piles of trash everywhere, so I sifted through (sanitized my hands afterward) and found a lot of useful clothing that was simply dirty or wet or both.   I took it home and have dried out all that is useful and bagged it to be washed and dried.

How would you like to help do the laundry? The laundromat at 20th and Clarkson  (Suds?) will let us do the laundry for free on Monday morning. Carolyn just brought two big containers of detergent, so your labor and maybe some Shout or dryer sheets would help a lot. I plan to be there at about 9:30 with four big bags (soon to be 5) to wash. One young lady who lives near and needs some clothes said she would come help in exchange for clothing and I have one more saint who may come help. 

If you can help, please call me at 303-316-6748 and let me know.  Here are some photos of step 1: drying everything out and step 2: sorting and bagging.  Now it is time for Step 3: Washing and drying.  How about a Step 4 where we meet for coffee before driving home?  It would be a real pleasure to meet any one with enough chutzpah to wash clothing for homeless people who are so often insulted and sold short.  They will be taken to Samaritan House and St. Francis Center within two days of getting them clean.  

For those of us who believe that even homeless people prefer to have clean clothing to wear when they can find it and who try to provide it for free, here is a last desperate step taken by an old social worker.  St. Francis Center gives out clothing on Wednesday and Friday afternoons.  Samaritan House likes to give it to their residents in 4 programs including a family section, but they will give anyone what you need if you go to the door and ask.  

Please put your commitment into real hard action and come help.",0,Homeless,405

My name is Jay and I'm here to promote an event coming up on Saturday July 24th that my non profit organization, No Kill Colorado (NKC), is involved with.  NKC's mission is to make Colorado the safest state for homeless pets.  Money raised from this particular event called Relay for Rescue (R4R) will go to local animal shelters in need of support which will help them save every healthy or treatable pet.  Relay for Rescue is a scavenger hunt that safely raises money for these shelters while having FUN!  This is basically a bar crawl that will take place downtown and participants need to complete different fun tasks along the way to compete for points.  Tasks include a balloon hop, locked elbows, newspaper press, and more.  All for the animals!  At the end points are tallied and the team that wins will get a cash prize to be used for that specific non profit.  For anyone who doesn't feel comfortable participating in person there is a virtual option!  You simply follow along on your phone and complete your tasks virtually.

Please visit the following for info on the event:

I need you to understand that this opportunity is for the rest of the homeless community and I have to say that  possibly half the  community has received the same amount of money and the same exact choice as I have had. I'm not going to shy away from the fact that I chose to pay some bills before I bought my drugs and if they don't want to do anything but  blow it all away that's fine but that's a very serious issue that needs to be made aware of and you know the problem will never go away if they are not going to be held accountable for their actions and decisions that they chose to make in the aspect of the homeless community that have had this opportunity for a chance at doing something different than continuing to be a part of the problem as a victim we understand is crap and the only reason we don't have the opportunity for the people to do what they are going around and raging out crying out and being the most important person who was their own individual self oppressed stuck in this situation and NOT you who help continually or anyone else but that individual.  I need you to understand that  only  maybe  half the community or something is being the way of the homeless community never getting the chance they are crying out for and persecuting people who have no role in the decision that person made when they got 7 to 12000 dollars back pay  and then chose to  blow it off with drugs and alcohol and their  whatever other choices. I'm open for you and I to get an interview with each other set and you and I have a lot of questions about time together to make an impact in our understanding of what is going to need to be implemented by us experienced in our own way and we have a very strong and positive attitude towards this standard strategy for the future innovation of all of us getting to the point of being the good and correct stew.,0,Homeless,383

My dog Lucy and I went for a walk this morning in the Art's District and it still looks pretty good.  However, I was struck by s liquor store at Florence St and Colfax.  Volunteers cleaned up the area in front and across the street from the liquor store, and we must have picked up 30 empty shot or 1/5 bottles.  This morning there was just as many empty bottles.  I noticed the store opens at 8:00 each day, and customers are pouring in there, and some are throwing out empty bottles almost immediately.

The question I have is should businesses that contributes to homeless, alcoholism, and an unsavory environment be allowed to stay open.  I'm going to lobby the city council to change the zoning rules for the Art's District.  

I may start a petition to garner support and show city council this is important.

503,162206217,Jude Wolf,South Park Hill,22 Sep,"Vote to end breed specific legislation. **update: remember to vote and do your own research rather than listening to biased comments in this discussion. We can not punish innocent dogs and responsible owners by keeping a ban that is proven to be ineffective! üê∂üíï

Vote YES on 2J this November to end Denver‚Äôs ban on pit bulls and implement dog laws that focus on responsible dog ownership!

Why?
Breed specific legislation doesn‚Äôt make cities safer. Breed isn‚Äôt an indicator of whether or not a dog will bite- responsible ownership is. It is proven that pit bulls are not disproportionately dangerous compared to other dogs. Enforcing Denver‚Äôs ban on pit bulls has cost the city over $5.8 million. Denver already has rules in place about animal attacks, bites, and dangerous animals. Overall it is discriminatory against responsible owners and their dogs. Thousands of family dogs have been euthanized because of this ban.

If you are interested in learning more, watch Beyond the Myth on amazon prime or reach out for more resources!

New legislation:
1. All pit bulls will be required to be microchipped.

2. All pit bulls will be required to be spayed or neutered. 

3. Only two pit bulls will be allowed per home.

4. Owners will be required to notify animal control if their dog escapes.

522,169420824,Timothy Carter,Hale,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"Lawsuit Proceedings. On December 15th and 16th, 2020, Federal District 10 Judge Martinez will be hearing our case against the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for violating constitutional rights by sweeping people without homes and with nowhere to go - even in a global pandemic. This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housing - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, ‚ÄúThe CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.‚Äù 

On top of this the suit addresses that, ‚ÄúOver the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (‚Äúto where?‚Äù is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).‚Äù The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can‚Äôt afford housing during this pandemic. 

Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that ‚Äúwhen I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.‚Äù Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time. 

Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. There will be a call-in number where the public can listen to the hearing. Stay tuned for this number. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to the hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place.

533,184960211,Dana Arvin,South Park Hill,27 Apr,"Petition to Get New Group Living Zoning on November Ballot. The Denver Gazette
Apr 27, 2021

The Denver City Council turned a deaf ear to the public before foisting the bitterly opposed ‚Äúgroup-living‚Äù zoning scheme ‚Äî a recipe for neighborhood deterioration ‚Äî on most of the city in February. The council had its fingers in its ears once again this month, when it extended some of that policy‚Äôs profoundly problematic provisions to the rest of Denver.

Had council members been listening, they would have heard deep concern and intense opposition from every quarter. From racially and ethnically diverse homeowners of every social and economic status, representing every point on the compass on the city map.

From supporters for this reckless new policy, however, the council would have heard little more than crickets. And that should come as no surprise given the impact it will have ‚Äî and how few people would want any part of it.

The council‚Äôs February vote sextupled the area of the city where homeless shelters and halfway houses may open, scrapped a buffer between Denver‚Äôs schools and halfway houses and permitted up to five unrelated residents/ tenants ‚Äî and all their family members ‚Äî in any single-family home. The council‚Äôs follow-up action this month extended one of those provisions ‚Äî allowing five unrelated adults to a house ‚Äî to the remaining minority of Denver neighborhoods that were still under the old, so-called ‚ÄúChapter 59‚Äù zoning.

All of the city now can look forward to more cars and trash cans lining the curbs of once-quiet residential streets. More overall noise and congestion, as well. What was once a next-door neighbor‚Äôs single-family home on a quiet cul de sac could become a de facto apartment complex ‚Äî without any of the infrastructure to support it.

Meanwhile, in the majority of the city that will bear the full brunt of the zoning changes, it will mean a homeless shelter or even a halfway house could open in a strip mall near your house. It could be next to day cares, schools, rec centers.

Obviously, there‚Äôs no core constituency for any of that. This sweeping rewrite of the city‚Äôs zoning code wasn‚Äôt a call for action by some broad-based citizens group. Nor was it the recommendation of some blue-ribbon panel of presumed experts. It was in fact little more than the daydream of a roomful of urban visionaries in the planning department at City Hall. It was handed off to the council and then imposed upon the public. Fait accompli; done deal.

Of course, the council insists it really was listening all along; that the planning department hosted numerous forums and engaged with Denver residents in other ways; that the policy was revised to accommodate some objections. Then, absent any grassroots support for the basic plan that remained in tact, the council bulldozed ahead anyway.

So, if City Hall was listening to residents, it also was ignoring them. Which is all the more galling.

Hence, a petition drive now underway to place the policy on this November‚Äôs ballot in hopes of prompting voters to overturn it. Spearheaded by the upstart citizens group Safe and Sound Denver, the petition drive represents a groundswell of opposition by everyday Denverites who are telling City Hall, ‚ÄúNo way. You can‚Äôt do this to our families; our neighborhoods; our lifetime investment ‚Äî our homes.‚Äù

Organizers need around 9,000 signatures by May 13; they are aiming for 15,000 signatures to ensure a place on the ballot. They have been hosting gatherings throughout Denver at which residents can sign a petition, and they have been announcing their efforts via an e-newsletter and a helpful and informative website. Visit the website ‚Äî safeandsounddenver.com ‚Äî for extensive background on the group-living policy itself and for information on how to get involved in the repeal campaign. One of the site‚Äôs pages also offers a lengthy list of neighborhood groups allied with the effort.

As daunting as it can be to fight city hall on any issue, there‚Äôs something uplifting and even heartwarming about this earnest, unflinching and spirited movement to roll back a bad policy. It arguably represents Denverites at their best ‚Äî volunteering their time, talents and energy to band together to push back at a wild overreach by local government.

Here is your chance to stand up for your families, your homes, your neighbors and your neighborhood; for your quality of life. Sign up, and get on board!

537,180840446,Giving Back,,21 Mar,"Today, March 21, is National Single Parent Day, a holiday honoring single moms and dads. This year it's more well-deserved than ever, with many singlehandedly juggling the day-to-day needs of their children with the unique challenges of parenting during a pandemic. 

But even those who do it all sometimes need the support of others. When that's the case, it's neighbors who often step up to help, assisting with basic needs, connecting them to local resources, and offering words of encouragement ‚Äî a trend that's repeated itself again and again on Nextdoor.

‚û§ Michelle was living in a Chicago shelter last fall with her young daughter when she first turned to her neighbors, who supplied her with diapers, clothing, and a gift card for food. By March, she had posted an update: ""We begin our next journey and finally found an apartment and out of shelter life. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.""

 ‚û§ In Nitro, West Virginia, a mother of two was embarrassed to ask for help but was facing financial hardship and in need of basic supplies to get through the week. Neighbors not only provided her with milk, eggs, toilet paper, and bread, but with kind words and resources.

‚û§ Tara in Littleton, Colorado, put out a request for a ""random act of kindness"" for a homeless single dad and his 13-year-old son, who were sleeping in a heated garage. Within days, the community had secured him a phone, job leads, a vehicle, and temporary housing. ""My faith in humanity has been completely restored,"" she said.

It's been heart warming to see our group grow to 30 members in less than a month! It's so good to see that our concerns are shared by others in the community , and that their are so many hands willing to work for good!

We have seen over the past month alone over a dozen sweeps of our Unhoused neighbours numbering in the hundreds of people displaced again and again. Moved from block to block, having their belongings discarded, and thier rights violated. The winter is cold enough already , but the city has been colder still. City council refused last month to adjust spending for homelessness mitigation despite several diverse and well thought out community proposals, in favor of increases to funding for sweeps and police overtime. ( The public education budget for next year is slashed btw & the police department is getting an extra 45 million)

Community volunteers have witnessed much over the past few months alone, police brutality, sexual assault by an officer , Hancocks excuses, city councils failure , and the displacement of hundreds more of our neighbours and friends due to the Covid related unemployment crises. 

But we have also made great strides together. We have a network of volunteers securing, storing, and preparing donations of food for sidewalk soup kitchen service, and soon we will have volunteers on the street every day to help feed and warm not just the homeless , but anyone who cares to stop , with a cup of warm soup or a hot coffee, to lessen the burden of their day. ( Interested in getting directly involved with sidewalk service ? Either securing donations , storing and preparing food and other goods, or helping with sidewalk service , please contact Cats Not Cops on Facebook or DM me for more info )

I apologize for a lack of updates on the sweeps that happened this week. For more consistent updates on sweeps and Denver Homeless Out Loud actions you can sign up for the email updates by emailing info@denverhomlessoutloud.org
These emails are unformated, hand typed updates with no nonsense, advertising or repetitive calls for monitary donations. It's just raw , informative updates on the week to week of our action plan and their results. 

This week the sweep of 16th and Pearl was heartbreaking. We have fed this encampment each week for the past month. Over 150 people who could not be admitted to the new church sponsored safe outdoor space  at 15th and Pearl were shuffled off to nowhere, losing possessions and losing more hope each time. 

I will make a post with updates on the action plan for next week as soon as I am privy.",2,Homeless,503

Denver has issued a ‚ÄòHome by 10‚Äô Public Health Order to combat the dramatic increase of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the city. Effective for 30 days starting Sunday, November 8, all people in Denver should be home by 10 p.m., with certain exceptions, including going to and from work, interstate travel, and getting medical care. During this time, all public and private gatherings of people who are not members of a single household are prohibited, except for limited purposes. 

This is not intended to be a traditional curfew, but rather a restriction on gatherings, business hours, and a guidepost for behavior that will help Denver get through the next 30 days. Any business not defined as critical must close to the public during Home by 10 hours. Critical businesses include, but are not limited to, hospitals, grocery stores, and pharmacies. 

No alcohol sales or consumption after 10 p.m. will be permitted at any facility that sells alcohol, including restaurants and grocery and liquor stores. Restaurants will still be able to offer food takeout and delivery after 10 p.m. Under the new order, groups at restaurants will now be limited to six people from no more than two households, down from 10 people, for the duration of the Home by 10 public health order.

Recreational athletic activities, including organized youth and adult league sports, practices, games, and tournaments, are prohibited. Spectators are prohibited at all post-secondary and Colorado High School Activities Association (CHSAA) sanctioned sporting events.  

The city is taking this action to help stem the increase in cases and hospitalizations and avoid another stay-at-home order being imposed on Denver by the State.

I am sure I am not alone in wanting to see some change. I am sure the best way to help our neighborhood is to join together as a community, but even if that happens, what steps can be taken to reduce the crime?

Right now Colorado does not have an eviction moratorium and limited eviction protections are set to expire TODAY!

We‚Äôre once again asking for your help to call on Governor Polis to #KeepColoradansHoused and demand an eviction moratorium to protect Colorado renters. We urge you to contact the Governor‚Äôs office at 303-886-2471 or tweet @GovOfCo  on behalf of our neighbors at risk of losing their home as we work to recover from the pandemic.

Without urgent action from Governor Polis, tens of thousands of Coloradans face homelessness, 300K-400K could be at risk of eviction by the end of the year. We have to make it clear to Governor Polis that our neighbors need action NOW.

We have had numerous conversations with clients in the past few days explaining that evictions have not been stopped at the national or state level, and that the limited protections that do exist expire tonight at midnight. 

Our actions have been moving the needle. Will you join us again in calling on the Governor to #KeepColoradansHoused

Here are some sample Twitter/FaceBook posts:

Thousands of Coloradans are unemployed. Expanded unemployment benefits have expired and Colorado has no eviction moratorium. @GovofCo we need you to step up to protect Colorado families from homelessness in the middle of a pandemic. Follow the lead of AZ and OR and #StopEviction #KeepColoradansHoused. 
The last thing people should be worried about right now is losing their home because they can‚Äôt pay rent. Coloradans need homes to be #SaferAtHome. Students need homes to attend school. @GovofCo please follow the lead of @GovInslee, @DougDucey and @KateBrownOR. #StopEvictions #KeepColoradansHoused. 
Taking the pandemic seriously means keeping Coloradans housed. You cannot be #SaferAtHome without a home. @GovofCo, hundreds of thousands are at risk. Do the right thing, issue an eviction moratorium.  https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk/
Oregon population 4.2 million, Colorado population 5.7 million, OR COVID rent relief $55 million, CO COVID rent relief $20 million, OR; eviction ban till Oct. CO: no eviction ban. @GovofCo follow Oregon‚Äôs lead. https://katu.com/news/local/oregon-distributes-70-million-in-covid-19-rental-relief-energy-assistance
Public benefits are expiring, and many Coloradans are not back at work full time. Evictions leave people exposed and in danger. @GovofCo, we need you. #KeepColoradansHoused https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk/
Why does Colorado continue to lag behind states like, Arizona, Oregon, and Washington on eviction protection? @GovofCo, let‚Äôs change that. #KeepColoradansHoused
We might all wish to be back at work in a post-pandemic world but we‚Äôre not. @GovofCo let‚Äôs acknowledge reality and #KeepColoradansHoused https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk/
Evictions resulting from the pandemic are not and do not have to be a political issue. @GovofCo we can, should, and must solve this together with landlords and tenants alike. #KeepColoradansHoused
Housing is a human right. Making thousands of people homeless during a pandemic is unspeakably cruel. We deserve better. Contact @GovofCo‚Äôs office at: 303-886-2471 demand action. #KeepColoradansHoused https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk/

I am DESPERATE for any help or advice!
I have moved my whole life and last year, unknowingly, moved into an apartment infested with roaches. From January until about March or April, I saw them regularly. Since then, hardly any, until recently. 

I had SEVERAL treatments and did my own. At that time, I tried talking to the Colorado Apartment Association, however, each person I spoke with gave me different responses and was basically told, ‚ÄúUnless, they‚Äôre falling in my food, it‚Äôs not a problem.‚ÄùI tried getting in contact with the health department, but with restrictions in place, I never got anywhere.  

Our complex got new management a few months ago during the warm months and they sent out notices to inspect every apartment and every building. I was excited to hear this, and since I hadn‚Äôt seen any, I naively assumed that they were gone. 

I have not brought it up yet to management about recent sitings (I will), however, since they have not been able to get rid of them previously , I want to see what steps to take. 

I‚Äôm moving next month and don‚Äôt want to take them with me!!! I‚Äôve read several different things online about people saying they‚Äôve managed to move successfully and others that haven‚Äôt...I know they hide in appliances and other things, and am not able to replace all my belongings.

I‚Äôm not sure if I buy a moving pod and bomb that or the apartment several times before moving. I keep calling exterminators but get representatives who just give me pricing options, but don‚Äôt sounds confident it‚Äôll work.

I'm here posting to all of you because 9News has a new partnership with Nextdoor. Let me get a few things out in the open first: I can't see anything you and your neighbors post privately. That's your business. I can only see and interact with what you post on my posts or messages you send directly to me. 

So why the heck am I here? I'm here because I love the local part of my job. I believe what's happening in your community is the most important news you can receive. I also believe that sometimes we miss the best stories that happen within small communities.  I want to change that. And I need your help.

What's good in your neighborhood? What are neighbors doing for each other? Who deserves a shout out?  What needs change? What are the challenges you face? Any story you feel like sharing. Feel free to comment. Or message me. If you want - we might share something inspiring on the news. I've got 4 hours of weekend newscasts begging for great stories.

After each batch, I have 10-15 pounds of spent grain that typically goes to waste.  A few years ago, I posted on my Centennial neighborhood Nextdoor - asking if anyone wanted it for compost.

All of it has been a bit overwhelming, but I wanted to share a happy neighborhood moment from this week and see if you've ever experienced anything like it in your neighborhood.

As I've mentioned far too many times here, I love to homebrew beer. It's a hobby that I've really ramped up to get me through this time at home.  This week I had a bucket of spent grain from a New England IPA I brewed.  I posted on my local Nextdoor to see if anyone needed compost. Mel messaged me that she'd love to use the spent grain and hops to feed her backyard chickens. In exchange - she gave me some eggs (and I threw in a homebrewed wheat ale). I scrambled a few eggs yesterday - they're delicious and you can tell the difference from store bought! She texted me later that the chickens LOVED the grains.  This is the beginning of another great partnership.

739,169539467,Timothy Carter,Hale,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"Arkins Sweep Update. For the past couple months police have been telling people who they sweep from other more visible downtown sites to go to Arkins. Now the City has  come in to sweep them. To where???

Why not provide dumpsters with regular trash pick up? Why not provide port-a-potties (at least 1 for every 10 people)? And if not that...why not provide housing that residents of this camp can afford according to their info? 

No, instead our City thinks sweeping 300 people to scatter to downtown blocks, down the river, or who knows where else is the answer.

Yesterday was the second day of sweeps at the Arkins encampment. The previous night residents of the camp were told they could not get back into their property - some slept right outside the fence with what they had. Others scattered to who knows where without their property. Others were told they could go in, but if they came back out they could not get back in to get the rest of their property. In the morning, starting around 6am, the City started trashing property - indiscriminately scooping property with bulldozers and bobcats and crains. Anyone who had their property there but was not allowed in lost all their property. One of the only people who got their property yesterday was a woman we helped get back in to get her stuff just before they were about to trash it. 

After the sweep yesterday, police went to numerous other camps around town - many where residents from Arkins moved to - telling them they could not be there under camping ban enforcement. People trying to move from the Arkins sweep were stopped from setting up at various camps - including cops threatening volunteers helping folks move with ‚Äúillegal dumping‚Äù if they unloaded the person‚Äôs property.

I have a friend who works with the homeless in downtown Denver. While the Coronavirus may actually pose little real threat to most of us, it poses a huge threat to those whose immune systems are already compromised. Thanks to all the people who CAN use soap and water (i.e. have regular access to SINKS) there is no hand sanitizer to be found anywhere. Yes, soap and water work fine IF YOU HAVE REGULAR ACCESS TO RUNNING WATER, which the homeless do not. 

My friend has gotten his hands on hundreds of small bottles that we need to fill with hand sanitizer to pass out to the homeless. Yes, we can make our own hand sanitizer but we need roughtly SIXTEEN GALLONS of it to fill the need! Hand sanitizer is basically just three parts alcohol with an alcohol content of 90% of above to one part emollient such as aloe vera or vegetable glycerine.  Most stores are also sold out of even the supplies needed to make it. 

We can purchase four gallons of alcohol for $100 and one gallon of vegetable glycerine for $12. If you can order either one and/ or donate or contribute, we need about $340 to make the sixteen gallons of hand sanitizer we need. That will fill 500 two-ounce bottles and provide one refill for each of those bottles. If you can donate or contribute, here are the links:

892,154297474,Tom Fesing,East Colfax,9 Jul,"Flag of the Day - Argentina üá¶üá∑. Today marks 204 years of Argentine independence, thus marking 200 years of the Declaration of Independence of the United Provinces of the Rio de La Plata. Referred to as the Independence of Argentina, it was declared on July 9, 1816 by the Congress of Tucum√°n. 

The Argentine independence movement began in 1806, when British attacks on Buenos Aires were repelled by local militia with little help from Spain. Also important were the ramifications of Napoleon I‚Äôs intervention in Spain, beginning in 1808. Napoleon‚Äôs overthrow of Ferdinand VII plunged Spain into a civil war between two rival governments‚Äîone set up by Napoleon and the other created by patriotic juntas in the name of the exiled king and aided by the British. Under ancient principles of Spanish law, the king‚Äôs dominions in America had the right to govern themselves until the restoration of a lawful king, and on May 25, 1810 (now celebrated as the day of the revolution), Buenos Aires established an autonomous viceroyalty in the name of Ferdinand, pending his restoration. However, when it became apparent that Ferdinand was virtually powerless following his restoration in 1814, an assembly of the members of the viceroyalty met at a home in San Miguel de Tucum√°n to discuss the situation. On July 9, 1816, they declared the country independent under the name of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata.

The flag of Argentina was created by Manuel Belgrano, in line with the creation of the Cockade of Argentina, and was first raised at the city of Rosario on February 27, 1812, during the Argentine War of Independence. The National Flag Memorial was later built on the site. The First Triumvirate did not approve the use of the flag, but the Asamblea del A√±o XIII allowed the use of the flag as a war flag. It was the Congress of Tucum√°n which finally designated it as the national flag, in 1816. A yellow Sun of May was added to the center in 1818.

There is controversy of the true color of the first flag, between scientist and the descendants of Manuel Belgrano between blue and pale blue.

The sun image on the flag is called the Sun of May because it is a replica of an engraving on the first Argentine coin, approved in 1813, whose value was eight escudos(one Spanish dollar). It has 16 straight and 16 waved sunbeams.

For the last two years, Denver city planners have been working with residents, policy experts, advocates and service providers, neighborhood groups and other community members to update the Denver Zoning Code‚Äôs regulations on residential uses.

The project's goal is to update zoning rules in support of the city‚Äôs strategy for more and better housing opportunities for all residents, to remove barriers for those who need supportive services and to provide greater clarity for providers and neighbors.

Starting next week, we'll host four open houses that will give residents an overview of the changes and an opportunity to share their thoughts.

Many children receive free food at school, and, with schools being shut down, some families may not be able to provide food for their children. 

I‚Äôm willing to provide food to children who may need breakfast or lunch. 

Anyone else who is willing to help, comment here.

914,170706186,Alexandra Kyles,South Park Hill,13 Dec,"Hi everyone ! Being a good person :). Happy Sunday everyone ! 
I just wanted to remind everyone to please tip your Instacart (all delivery) workers well :)

We deliver groceries to the Park Hill neighborhood (and beyond) during these times and many people don‚Äôt tip or tip a very small amount. Myself and many others work for Instacart and maybe it isn‚Äôt known but Instacart pays about $8 per grocery delivery (no hourly pay) a very small living wage so that being said we work for tips ! 

I just wanted to put this out there for people like myself who have lost their job and now purely rely on delivery services as an income. 

Let‚Äôs all care for one another and everyone who is helping us during these times.
What goes around comes around !
Stay safe and take care :)",0,Homeless,160

There is a Super Target in Northfield.  Now, wait!  I know, that is not Green Valley Ranch or even Montbello!  But, I have some encouraging news for all of us that live in The Far Northeast quadrant in Denver.  There have been meetings discussing a new town center in our area.  Guess what?  The main proposed retailer is COSTCO!  There will be other amenities of course besides Costco.  The idea is to make it a family oriented area and its proposed location is Green Valley Ranch Road and Memphis ground breaking scheduled 2021 with completion 2022.  I know, I know.  That seems a long time off.  There are things still needing to do by all the parties involved.  I can wait!!!!  I have to!",2,Homeless,170
919,152107946,LaKia Thomas,North Park Hill,18 Jun,"Park Hill Post Office. My family has frequented the Park Hill Post Office for over 30 years. Today we were treated with so much disrespect! When I questioned about why we were never notified our mail was being held, there was no accountability for their mistakes. The current manager, Jessica Santos, went into to not only be as rude as she could be but berate me in front of other customers that were waiting in line. If anyone has any contact information for her superiors, then I would greatly appreciate it. Apparently she owns the entire postal service and there‚Äôs no one above her. You would think during this time we would have a better sense of humanity. Good job USPS you picked a winner to manage your facility.",0,Homeless,144

Talked to manager there who said that customers who were confronted about their non compliance had become violent and HD did not have security staff to manage the backlash.  SO. Suggest you use True Value or Ace hardware stores when you can.  They seem well run and customers quite compliant.  I did report HD to state and city health department.",2,Homeless,94
