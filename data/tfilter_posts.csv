Amen.
That church is doing exactly what they should be doing. You should be ashamed of yourself.
What church? National Jewish is a hospital and this borders their construction lot.
Wow, lady.
Thanks for the heads up, I‚Äôll  bring them some sandwiches and keep an eye out on the playground to pick up IF there is trash.
I don‚Äôt know exactly how I‚Äôd react if this was on my corner. I‚Äôm pretty sure nit well but this is probably the most decent comment I‚Äôve seen for both sides involved in a long time. üôåüèΩ(edited)
Is anyone else OUTRAGED that our city and community doesn‚Äôt do more to care for our houseless neighbors!? If you want to see less houseless camps, donate money, volunteer for organizations like Denver Homelessness Outloud, and vote for elected officials that are actually working for an equitable society/community.
Its not about lack of money. The City of Denver has $50 million each year in the budget to address homelessness. The question is are they deploying it effectively - seems not.
I drive by this on my way to work at 230 am. The people there are out and about in the neighborhood at that time. I chased one out of a car last week. This morning someone was carrying a large box of stuff down the block. I see them urinating often. 
Well said. Thank you.
Where are these unhoused people suppose to go?
How about shelters or the coliseum parking lot or another sanctioned camp? Somewhere that is set up to help. I worked building apartments where I had to step over people on the sidewalk passed out. The police said not to try and wake them. I also walked between jobs through an alley that ran between restaurants so filled with human feces I almost vomited. Watched people shoot up there in the open. So there is a real problem no doubt but the solution should not involve making our neighborhoods unsafe for children or adults to walk down the sidewalk. Or to contaminate the parking strips, streets or yards with human waste or drug paraphernalia. I am sympathetic to the plight of the homeless but also know that not all are mentally ill or just down on their luck. Let‚Äôs find a real solution not force our neighbors to host campers
Kansas
Basically what Giuliani did for New York shipped them to Jersey. Not funny but I mean, kinda funny.
OK, you‚Äôre outraged. So, where do you suggest they SQUAT? You have a First World issue that you‚Äôre applying to third world people.
Y‚Äôall are quick to bring lost dogs home with you but to help a human being oh gosh no ... listen I‚Äôm not perfect either but just consider it for a moment.
I have helped many homeless and have been screwed over every time.
Rachael Chitty üò¢Thank You for trying. Sadly each human has a long story for why they are homeless; yet we can try to do something.
Thanks for the numbers Beth Daoud . Try not to let the virtue signaling from mayfair and cherry creekers change how you feel about your own neighborhood. We have called a few times and will continue to call and do what we think is right for our space.... If someone is bashing on you for having your own feelings and protecting your neighborhood, maybe we can help. They can post their address and I will pay for the cab ride to move the people in question to a""less hostile"" area. Bam..everyone wins.
Agree
NIMBY much?
When we discharge a homeless person from the ED.  Resources of several pages are given to them.  Sometimes it goes out the door with them.  Often it is thrown in the garbage.
What is a houselessness person supposed to do with those papers? Get in the car, drive home and get on the computer?
They have phones.  We are always charging them.  iPhone chargers we have bought for charging them at work.  It is rare they do not have a phone.  They have told me they‚Äôd rather be on the street.
Stephanie R. I work at a hospital, specifically the ER. We not only discharge with pamphlets, throw them at the homeless and send them on their way. We offer a plethora of counseling and additional resources. How dare you suggest otherwise. I am not a young woman, I have been doing this for decades. I know the value of keeping beer in the employee frig at the hospital for homeless alcoholics. When I drive past some of these encampments I know what is going on and I know the kinds of people who frequent them. The people in the encampments who want help and want to change know how to seek the resources. A lot of them are better versed in the law and social services available than most police officers. ‚ÄúWell then that‚Äôs a mental health issue‚Äù seriously we know this. When I sign discharge papers and than someone takes a literal poo on them and leaves it in the center of a room? Sane? Maybe. But that‚Äôs what‚Äôs out there. YOU‚ÄôRE not going to fix it, I AM not going to fix it, the OP isn‚Äôt going to. Certainly getting on a high horse on Nextdoor mocking neighbors for their concerns CERTAINLY won‚Äôt fix it. When Reagan shut down the mental services in this country, the problem started rolling downhill. We need group efforts at the very highest levels. We don‚Äôt need to be worrying about the All Star game and how great Polis and Hancock will look. Further, putting these encampments in the middle of neighborhoods is not a good idea. The criminal element which almost always follows these encampments is not worth the risk to neighbors and children. (Just so people know, a lot of sexual predators stay in encampments because housing is difficult for them to obtain...more broken systems) So, this is an extremely complex problem. This NIMBY stuff being thrown around like it‚Äôs meant to embarrass people for their concern is, in a word, stupid. You want to help? Go into the encampments and clean. Get trained in narcan protocols. Clean up used needles (although the homeless tend to pick those up and resell them in exchange for drugs) with a biohazard box. Dispense condoms. Dispense sanitizer. Dispense common meds like neosporin and hydrogen peroxide. It‚Äôs not the sexy stuff like socks and food but the encampments get plenty of socks and food. The unsexy stuff like condoms and basic meds is much more useful. 
iPhones are the most common.  And Samsung.   Offices are open(edited)
If you have an idea/project that you think could help people who are struggling with housing who are the best people to contact?
There‚Äôs several.  The sidewalk project in LA they are doing great work and have shown interest in a Denver chapter.  Also some churches (not all which is crazy) have programs for volunteers.  I bet there‚Äôs also an app for volunteers you could download.  Or neighbors like me - would love to hear your idea.  I‚Äôm a figure it out make it happen person.(edited)
I hope these camps never include one of your children.
That is the easy part, being a NIMBY.  How about complaining to your City Council rep that there isn't enough low income housing. (Not that it would do any good).  Or better yet, call REDPEAK  AND ask them to designate 5% of their apartments for low income housing.
Judy Werner the easy part is getting on a neighborhood app and throwing an acronym around at your neighbors and completely dismissing their concerns. Calling Redpeak and requesting 5% go to affordable housing is naive. How about our kind and generous governor and mayor reach out to Redpeak and offer tax incentives for converting a percentage of housing into affordable apartments? How about we discuss our elected officials who make campaign promises and not hold up their end of the entrusted vote? Turning on your neighbor because he or she is scared is not a solution.
So, your solution to your ‚Äúoutrage‚Äù is to attempt to force your unhoused neighbors to be relocated to... a different neighbor‚Äôs backyard?? How is calling NJH security anything other than harassment of people who are experiencing homelessness and need a place to sleep??
Because there are plenty of shelters for those who simply need a place to sleep. But what about the chronically homeless? The ones who do not follow the rules of the shelters? Addicts will do anything to support their addiction. I don't believe the average citizen has the skill set to personally handle this. I support the groups that provide housing, Healthcare, etc. as they are trained. We bring sleeping bags that get traded for alcohol or drugs...the problem runs deeper than a sleeping bag will solve.
You can‚Äôt talk about the unhoused community in absolutes. ‚ÄúThey have phones.‚Äù ‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs a mental health issue,‚Äù referring to why people are living on the streets. And sure there‚Äôs a criminal element to homelessness sometimes, but I‚Äôd argue that it‚Äôs more complex than people choosing to commit crimes. And sure, some are addicts, but some are not. 
Lane O‚ÄôConnor you say you‚Äôre not here to criticize anyone but you criticized the OP and you‚Äôre criticizing those who don‚Äôt have the same view as you.

The fire dept showed up in our back alleyway yesterday. I realized later when pulling out of our garage that our neighbor‚Äôs garage had burn marks on it and it looked like a small fire started and was put out quickly.
This is disturbing, will be on the lookout!
There was a fire in our alley two nights ago as well, Fire Dept thought it might have been a cigarette butt hitting a patch of dry weeds/sticks/grass next to a garage... but had they not come soon enough, our garage and our neighbor's garage would have been destroyed. I'm concerned.

5,11,11,185372613,Doug Bohm,Congress Park,1 May,"Homeless tent ablaze burning car & property. Last night, approximately 11:30pm Friday April 30th, the large homeless tent on 14th Ave between Josephine and Columbine had caught fire. 
The fire spread to an adjacent car and the shrubbery next to the neighboring multi-family unit. Flames were reportedly 40 ft in the air. 
Neighbors are claiming that they have photos and video of a neighbor stabbing the tent in the last couple weeks and he has had an altercation with the homeless person.
Police arrived and neighbors began giving them info that they refused to act on, offering the video and photo evidence. 
When the fire department arrived, they let the tent burn out until it caused some large bushes next to cars on private property to catch fire. 
They said they weren‚Äôt sure if the tent dweller was still inside. A weird justification not to contain a fire that has now spread to private property. Both the car and the bushes. 
The homeless man emerged a couple blocks away and was not there at the time of the fire. 
This arson is deliberate regardless of the justification. 
The reason I bring this up is because allegedly the perpetrator in this situation may be disturbed and potentially violent. 
Single females have been harassed and verbally threatened by this individual. In most cases they have been bullied into not filing a restraining order out of fear of retaliation.  
This neighbor has had several altercations with other tenants in his own building as well as the neighbors are all gathering reports, photos, videos and information of incidents dating back over the last several years.
If anyone has anything to add regarding the fire or this individual, please reach out publicly here or privately via messaging and I will get this information to the city. 
Thank you for being great neighbors who look out for each other, and stay safe out there.

There is a tiny home village established in Globeville. It took nearly 4 years to get the 24 tiny homes set up. 
Gawd...I don‚Äôt like homeless people trashing neighborhoods(personal experience)but burning down anyone‚Äôs property is just wrong.
I believe we have a Pryro , several fires have been set in the general vicinity of colfax ( all along the corridor. Within 2-3 blocks , in cap hill and city park west as well . I do not believe this was a single incident. But that the fire department did not put it out is kind of disturbing .
From the way you wrote your post, sounds like the neighbor who stabbed the tent was the one who started the fire. Why would this man purposely burn his only belongings? Let‚Äôs not assume here the homeless man started the fire.(edited)
Sadie Martin neighbor describes someone who has a home.
I agree with Iheanyi, the OP was saying that the homeless person who lived in the tent was not there, that there is a housed neighbor who has been attacking their tent.

Hello everyone.  I have a friend who has been very involved in getting the homeless issue back on the ballot - the ""group living"" allowance which is the loophole to what we are seeing in Denver, namely massive encampments alongside properties.  The organization behind this ballot push is called safeandsounddenver.org and they have had citywide locations set up the last few weekends to acquire signatures.  It's probably worth looking into this as the problem is not being solved and the impact on neighborhoods is extreme, as you have just witnessed.  There was one adjacent to my work for 8 weeks.  That's how long it takes to basically move them along.  In the meantime, drug dealers provide a tent, propane and essentials to the head honcho of the encampment, who then aids in the distribution of the drugs.  As such, the people in these types of encampments - not families trying to get a break, as the proponents would have you believe - have no interest in shelters where they can't do drugs.  Once the city finally cracks down on them, after two months of waste, debris, garbage, drug paraphernalia, feces, etc. have accumulated next to properties trying to conduct business or reside while paying property taxes, they simply move to a new place to settle and await the eight week turnaround.  It's a disaster.  It's a multi-layered issue, I realize, but getting this back on the ballot is an important step.
Just FYI that link doesn‚Äôt seem to be correct
Do you know what happened to the person who lost all their belongings and has been the target of the violent person? Is there any kind of collection going on to get them some much needed survival gear?
Hey I live in the building where this happened. The tent-guy involved lost a lot of what he owned. :[  A bunch of his money, as well as all his clothing, tent, etc. us neighbors pooled together what cash we had and provided some clothing, jackets, blankets, phone, water, cereal, fruit snacks. I offered him my tent but he declined because he said he has a tent he can probably get back from friend. I don‚Äôt want to give out his personal contact info publicly without permission, but message me if you want and I‚Äôll let him know/ask if he‚Äôs cool with me passing it along to you. Thank you so much for the offer of help. <3(edited)
Hi, I live in the building involved and was present from as the fire department arrived to well after everything was put out. I also have photos and videos of almost the entire incident (but not when the fire was actually set unfortunately).
Hi Edward, I‚Äôm a reporter with CBS4. Do you have some time to chat? Please give me a call at 720-387-0225
Seems like a hate crime to me.
Great Edward.  I saw a kid hit by a car on his bicycle once and the story, as relayed on ND, was so far from the truth, it was shocking. Folks posting comments about ‚Äòdrivers‚Äô and ‚Äò23rd‚Äô ....it was clearly the kids fault for blowing a red light. The driver was mortified (happened right in front of me), ambulance arrived, kid was scared to death of getting in trouble ....that was it. 
Fictional? Hardly.
Some one lit a fire in the dumpster of our building that same day! Couldn‚Äôt just been a cigarette but it was a giant fire for just a cig!
Hello, Andrea Flores with CBS4 here. I am looking to speak with someone who can fill me in a little more about what happened Friday night. Please email me at anflores@cbs.com. Thanks!
This is why we have to be very careful about the anti-homeless people rhetoric I see a lot on places like Nextdoor. It can incite some pretty tragic things. Let‚Äôs all look out for each other, everyone. ‚ù§Ô∏è
This is a direct result of the hate the homeless campaigns I see and hear on a regular basis. Both from neighbors on here and even public officials in office. There are few that realize or take into account that our homeless population are still human and have human rights and needs. It's sad but true.
Yeah the people on nextdoor and other platforms spewing hate at the homeless are largely responsible for this. I‚Äôm heartbroken.
Emily M. When you are a single female and have to call the police on men looking through your windows and laying across your door in the am, it has NOTHING to do with nextdoor or anti jobless rhetoric. I joined Nextdoor because I was ALREADY being threatened and needed to feel safer having extra eyes and ears in the neighborhood. It sounds like people who defend dangerous homeless situations don‚Äôt actually live or interact with drug and crime dwelling people on their doorstep.
Wonder if this incident is related to the arson incidents that have been popping up all over the cap hill area? I just saw another story about someone lighting cardboard on fire and trying to use it to set fences on fire. Apparently this individual is also setting garbage cans and bushes on fire as well.
Situations like this are the natural consequence of the failed policies of the Hancock Administration.  In the absence of an effective public safety response to these unsanctioned encampments, people will engage in self-help measures to deal with them.
I wouldn‚Äôt consider committing arson self help.
","Homeless tent ablaze burning car & property. Last night, approximately 11:30pm Friday April 30th, the large homeless tent on 14th Ave between Josephine and Columbine had caught fire. 
The fire spread to an adjacent car and the shrubbery next to the neighboring multi-family unit. Flames were reportedly 40 ft in the air. 
Neighbors are claiming that they have photos and video of a neighbor stabbing the tent in the last couple weeks and he has had an altercation with the homeless person.
Police arrived and neighbors began giving them info that they refused to act on, offering the video and photo evidence. 
When the fire department arrived, they let the tent burn out until it caused some large bushes next to cars on private property to catch fire. 
They said they weren‚Äôt sure if the tent dweller was still inside. A weird justification not to contain a fire that has now spread to private property. Both the car and the bushes. 
The homeless man emerged a couple blocks away and was not there at the time of the fire. 
This arson is deliberate regardless of the justification. 
The reason I bring this up is because allegedly the perpetrator in this situation may be disturbed and potentially violent. 
Single females have been harassed and verbally threatened by this individual. In most cases they have been bullied into not filing a restraining order out of fear of retaliation.  
This neighbor has had several altercations with other tenants in his own building as well as the neighbors are all gathering reports, photos, videos and information of incidents dating back over the last several years.
If anyone has anything to add regarding the fire or this individual, please reach out publicly here or privately via messaging and I will get this information to the city. 
Thank you for being great neighbors who look out for each other, and stay safe out there.

It's your house! These are challenging times for many of us. If you can rent out part of your home to others, it helps you stretch your income AND it provides affordable housing for someone. Looks like a win win to me.
I do like the comparison to having 12 kids in the house versus a non-relative tenant.  I am not sure where I would stand on that ordinance since I see both sides, so I appreciated Ruthie's analysis.
Agreed.  Just curious to read the communication / dialogue.

I don‚Äôt like the multi people in one dwelling because it is backed by developers who only want to make quick money and move on with out putting thought in to what really makes a neighborhood.  Affordable individual housing for people in a regular neighborhood.  Why should a teacher or social worker have to share a kitchen just to make ends meet.  Dorm style living is for college in life we need safe sustainable individual housing
Teachers and Social Workers can't afford Denver anymore. That's why group living is necessary (also because whenever someone tries to develop affordable units along with a bunch of other units the neighborhood tends to get up in arms about traffic and parking). It'd be nice if a teacher or social worker didn't have to share a kitchen to make ends meet but, well, my brother-in-law and his wife are an architect and a librarian and they were priced out of Denver entirely, could only buy in Wheat Ridge. So yeah I mean I guess if you have a way to build a ton of individual units (probably that'd have to be a high rise), go for it. There's not really undeveloped land in Denver to develop a bunch more single family homes that are close to existing amenities.
Kathleen Delaney , I am talking about one house, built 90 years ago. According to zoning,it cannot have two non-related people living in the existing separate two levels.
Its one thing when you live in the home and have a renter.  We had the landlord of a house across the street rent to a number (hard to tell how many with all the coming and going) of young men.  We endured months of loud parties in the wee hours, neglected lawn, loose dogs, trash, etc.  Neither the police nor the landlord would do anything.
So what do you complain about when it's the owner's acting like this?
George Ibarra, good point.
Some folks are for the single family deal due to people coming and sharing space with relatives or neighbors from out of town, and having lots of vehicles that wind up on lawns...
Thanks Ruthie and others for your sensible reaction to our neighbors who sign, what in my thinking is the worry and fear based ""Safe and Sound Denver"" petition to get something on the ballot that our ELECTED City Council members, who represent us, voted on and passed! Done deal.
I was born and raised here and am raising my own son here.  I am appalled at the way city council members take money from developers with zero thought to how it will impact a neighborhood or schools.  We need parking solutions, walkability, traffic input,  future electric car plug in sights.
In the UK where i live most of the year, we call them ‚Äúlodgers‚Äù rather than tenants. Different category. Maybe look into it....
Or tenements
My concern is about high-rises in the neighborhoods (which impact views, light and the historic character of some areas) and the lack of parking required for higher density living.
Robin Pitt , I don't like those either.  Yet, my neighbors and I are limited in sharing un-used space in our houses because of this bigger fear.
Early on, I thought the SOS people made some reasonable points, but they went pretty far over the deep end as discussions progressed regarding the group housing changes.  Being able to rent out a basement apartment that was already part of your house isn't in the least objectionable to me, but I did worry when the city was talking about allowing 10 unrelated people plus kids to rent a house even smaller than mine.(edited)
If the amendment only increased the number of people allowed to live in a house, I‚Äôd be okay with it - but despite the name ‚Äúgroup living amendment‚Äù the amendment contains verbiage that will allow more halfway homes and correctional facilities (called ‚Äúresidential care facilities‚Äù) to open in our neighborhoods- possibly next door to you.  I‚Äôm not going to argue with you if you think that‚Äôs okay.  I‚Äôve done the research on recidivism and I prefer to not live nextdoor to a halfway home or correctional facility. I would like to be able to have the opportunity to vote and that‚Äôs what the petition is about.
You know what helps with recidivism... Belonging to a community. I grew up with a ""boy's home"" a block away, they got into less trouble than the kids that's lived in there neighborhood.(edited)

We also have a large population of WORKING homeless because they can't afford housing and need to be close to work.
Thank you Ruthie. Very well put.
If this was me I would start really giving them a reason to be upset and offended. Start throwing huge parties that get loud. Buy hideous lawn decorations. Make really loud moaning sounds late at night. Sit outside in your robe sipping tea and stare judgementally at them. Fireworks help. I have tons of ideas if you need more.

Call TRUA - they will find him lodging and pay rent. Like all subsidized programs, he will have to fill out applications and correspond via email.
311 can get you to TRUA.
Can we get a little more information such as price range, date he has to be out of current residence and house or apartment? Thanks!
Hi Sherry, I am going to talk to him tomorrow and will get more information. He is currently paying $850 and still works full time. I know that he is a veteran, so I will check to see what benefits he is receiving and what care he can get through the VA. His current living situation is zoned as an apartment, but is technically a row home with it's own enterance. He has a small dog.
Try the @stFrancisCenter. Also, his hospital has a social worker. InnovAge, Senior Housing Options.(edited)
InnovAge is not a residential program- it's an adult day care and comprehensive HMO-A  participant must have stable housing to be accepted.  It's a good program once that is in place.
Karin Schumacher correct. I mention InnovAge both because their program likely has social workers and related knowledge or recommendations. Brainstorming all possibilities for this vulnerable individual!

All subsidized senior housing has 3-5 year waiting lists. Hopefully he has enough money to rent a market rate apt.

If he can afford it contact placement and senior care expert, Kelly O‚ÄôConnor 720. 507.5237
Silvernest also has shared housing options which can be temporary or permanent
Also Sunshine shared housing
I‚Äôm not sure if this rule still applies but they can‚Äôt make him leave because of his health. Call renter assistance
Maybe a realtor can give some advice.
Because the building is being sold the old lease/contract is null and void no matter what his health is. They do have to give him  a 30-day possession notice.

I manage Montview Manor at 16th and Steele Street, and we currently have several units for rent.  We provide affordable housing for seniors ages 62+.  He is welcome to call 303-320-6133 for more information.
This is a wonderful place. I've not seen the apartments but the public rooms are lovely. I know several people who live here. Also, the manager is a very good person.....!
If he gets care at the va, they have services for veterans. He should teach out to his primary care doctor to get more resources

I am going though cancer treatment as well. His best option is to speak with his social workers at the hospital - they are likely checking on him for every infusion anyway. They will be able to take over his situation.

I welcome everyone to put a prayer out to him that he‚Äôs in a happier place now .

How sad is this that we live in times where people die of the cold ... Hypothermia... Have u ever been cold so cold u cant stop shaking its an experience like no other... I am bothered and saddened that we as a people have deaths like this
I was thinking the same and couldn‚Äôt articulate it as well. I didn‚Äôt know David, but it breaks my heart that anyone should suffer this fate
There are three hotels downtown right now open for the homeless to stay for free.  its only for homeless and there are lots of vacancies available.
Rip david
This is the saddest post I‚Äôve ever seen on NextDoor. I can‚Äôt stop crying and I feel terrible to have not known this man. I feel stupid asking this question, but how can we help in the future? To prevent this and to help those in need? I always hear conflicting messages, so if anyone has direct ways that we can support the homeless community, especially in times of extreme weather, please let me know.
Becky Robinson I gather warm clothes, bedding & household items and take them to 2 shelters regularly if you have something to donate. Also call or email Mayor Hancock who still refuses to help the homeless and tell him how you feel. 10 years of fighting  him & city council is tiring me out.
What a kind face and beautiful smile.  I didn't know about him and his story but thank you to all of the kind people who help him and others and thank you Virginia and Lynn for honoring him by letting us all know. This makes me very very sad.
We as a community need to do something about this ... I myself found myself stuck with my car keys locked the car the other night. ... Trying to get the door open i almost froze so i can only imagine
I agree i want to help somehow
We need to organize and set up a structure of some sort at designated locations with some type of blankets or heaters hand warmers etc and have it open during the coldest temperatures or some type of hotline even to call if u r in need ...

Hancock is finally sending outreach workers to the camps to get them help. They can get warm @ St Francis Center & get warm clothes there & at Samaritan House where they may find shelter. Not enough, but I can take donations here as I  have been doing.  Let me be the clearing house.
My son took David breakfast burritos each morning and was wondering where he was. I stupidly assumed that when the temps dropped public agencies would come pick up homeless and take them to temporary warm shelter. For someone to die from the cold! No words. üíî(edited)
This is incredibly sad.  Unfortunately no one can make a person go into shelter. There are shelters for people experiencing homelessness.  Many people choose not to go for different reasons.  Shelters have been open 24/7 since the beginning of March 2020. This breaks my heart.
For folks asking how to help, there are some mutual aid networks doing great work. Denver Homeless Out Loud is a good place to start... I'm sure if you reach out they can let you know what they need in terms of donations, volunteers, etc.
Yes. I have worked with them over the years. Strong folks, but can't store things
I sat and talked with David when I brought him some hot soup and other items.  He was an extremely soft and well spoken man.  He did have a delightful smile that came from within.  Virginia, Lynn and others can fill you in if they choose, but David refused to go to any shelter.  Many tried brainstorming to come up with ways to help him..  He also gave away many items that were given to him, ""because I had too much"".  I think he thought that others were worse off than he was.  When I spoke with him, he never complained about anything.  I too am crying over David's tragic death, but I like to think that his struggles are over and he is nice and warm now with everything he needs and could ever want.
He looks young and hardy in this picture. How old was he? It‚Äôs so sad someone like this and anyone should die alone outside in the freezing cold.
Katie Warnke David was 37 years old.
My heart is broken to learn about David , I saw him last week I saw him and drop off some tea ü•≤ü•≤
So heartbreaking. This is terrible and tragic.
This is just so sad I can't find words.  As Lisa mentions above, my son cooked a burrito for David every day.  Checking in w him was a part of my son's every day routine.  He got to know him as a friend, was surprised how young, intelligent & kind hearted he was.  He wasn't interested in going to a shelter, said he was used to the cold & had been ""doing fine"" there for a year. Maybe he was fearful, maybe it was pride. I don't know what else to say as I sit here in the comfort of my warm house.
David was a giver, a true kind and gentle human being wanting to do good  for others even when he was at the lowest point in his life.  
Would others who cared about David like to meet up at the park bench to have a Covid-safe memorial for him?
I‚Äôm in , I think David would of liked this .
I'm in!  I like to term it a celebration of life.
I did not have the honor of knowing David & sure wish I did. He sounds like a beautiful soul who enriched so many people's lives. I would certainly like to join you if I am not working & this happens. üôèüíï RIP David üôèüíï

I have watched this thread for awhile and hoped so much David would accept help from an equipped agency.  But, he was well cared for by the neighborhood bakers, mitten givers, soup, burrito and tea makers and mental health experts and kind and loving people who saw him and treated him as a human being.  The absolute compassion shown by you all was truly a portrait of love.  While systems failed this soul hearts did not.  Thank you all for your loving care of David.
","Our homeless Neighbor David. Dear neighbors

With great sadness we wanted to let everyone who has helped David these last couple of months know that sadly David has passed away . 
He passed away from the cold temperatures last week on his beloved bench where he felt safe and supported by our wonderful community.  
I welcome everyone to put a prayer out to him that he‚Äôs in a happier place now . 
We will miss him. 
Virginia & LynnHow heartbreaking.  He was a gentle soul caught up in a difficult year for him and many others.  RIP David.  Thanks for letting us know.

How sad is this that we live in times where people die of the cold ... Hypothermia... Have u ever been cold so cold u cant stop shaking its an experience like no other... I am bothered and saddened that we as a people have deaths like this
I was thinking the same and couldn‚Äôt articulate it as well. I didn‚Äôt know David, but it breaks my heart that anyone should suffer this fate
There are three hotels downtown right now open for the homeless to stay for free.  its only for homeless and there are lots of vacancies available.
Rip david
This is the saddest post I‚Äôve ever seen on NextDoor. I can‚Äôt stop crying and I feel terrible to have not known this man. I feel stupid asking this question, but how can we help in the future? To prevent this and to help those in need? I always hear conflicting messages, so if anyone has direct ways that we can support the homeless community, especially in times of extreme weather, please let me know.
Becky Robinson I gather warm clothes, bedding & household items and take them to 2 shelters regularly if you have something to donate. Also call or email Mayor Hancock who still refuses to help the homeless and tell him how you feel. 10 years of fighting  him & city council is tiring me out.
What a kind face and beautiful smile.  I didn't know about him and his story but thank you to all of the kind people who help him and others and thank you Virginia and Lynn for honoring him by letting us all know. This makes me very very sad.
We as a community need to do something about this ... I myself found myself stuck with my car keys locked the car the other night. ... Trying to get the door open i almost froze so i can only imagine

Parkhill Methodist Church will be the site for a homeless camp.  This will be there from June 1-6 months.  If people want to get involved in assisting this might be a good place.
Sounds great! Thanks

Joanna, I worked with CCH and homeless vets for years.  This is a great project. I would love to donate $$  and I also have more seedlings started here at home than I could ever use. Mostly tomatoes and peppers. Happy to donate a few when they‚Äôre ready to go outside on their own!  I‚Äôm also a pretty good carpenter and if you need help building garden beds, let me know.
Thank you so much for this generous offer! I‚Äôm not sure if I should start from seedlings or from seeds.. is it too tough to get seeds started outside because of late frosts? What do you think?
I have soil and a number of pots I can donate as well (great for peppers etc.) I'll check for extra tools too. DM me and we'll figure out how best to transfer things to you!
I will also contribute in memory of my dad who served 26 years in the AF.  What kind of tools do you need?
Hi kammy! Thank you so much for your generous offer, and thanks to your dad for his service. I‚Äôm working on coordinating with some folks to pick up supplies tomorrow and this weekend, could I circle back with you when I figure out what I still need? Thank you so much!
We can donate some cedar wood for building the bed if that helps. We also can donate some plants later, depending on how our seedlings do (we start them inside). We just started our seeds and would love to plant more for our veterans. Do you have any requests? We typically plant tomatoes, peppers, chard, kale, zucchini, etc. and transfer outside beginning in early June.
What I wonderful idea! I don't have anything right now but love and wish it much success. Two of my dear friends work at the coalition.
I have some extra bags of compost and topsoil if you would like to pick them up
We have tons of seeds to give away. Msg me to find a time when you can come to our office. Thank you for your excellent work!
I have a bunch of compost to donate. I toss leaves and grass clippings into a corner of the yard and leave them to cook for a year or two. There is a lot of it. Probably a truckload. Also pots.
I would love to donate some tools, shovel, spades etc. Please pm me so I can get them to you. If you need specific items let me know.

The only description she gave me was what I posted.  Our building doesn't have security cameras but you can bet I emailed our HOA board and it will be addressed at our next meeting.  Hoping someone else may have him on camera.  I think he was mentally disturbed and homeless.
Yikes! Thanks, I live 1st and Jackson. This very concerning!
That is very scary!
I guess this is a good reminder to all of us to be vigilant.  I'm glad for your neighbor that nothing worse happened.
Screaming ""FIRE"" is a good way to get the attention of neighbors and passersby--it's OK, to save your life!
One word: Taser!
She had mace on her keychain but she said it happened so fast that she just ran.
Thank u for sharing.  We will spread the word on the 4-5th block.
I‚Äôm almost positive I saw this man yesterday near Jackson and Ellsworth around 330 pm. He was wearing baggy clothes with his hood up and was carrying a duffel bag. He was walking on the sidewalk on the same side that I was running with my dog, and pretended to fall into the street when I got close to him (it was very clear he didn‚Äôt trip or anything). I got a bad vibe from him and I could tell he was fine so I kept running, and he then proceeded to yell at me for not helping him and tried to get me to approach him. Luckily a couple turned onto the street at the same time this was happening and he got up and left. I felt very scared/uncomfortable after that, but glad I trusted my instincts. Thank goodness your neighbor is okay!!(edited)
Good Job trusting your instincts!!  He is clearly targeting women.
I hope this was reported this the CCN Association because it‚Äôs my understanding there‚Äôs a security agency that patrols the area. It‚Äôs also worth reporting to the police dept for awareness rather than wait for something awful to happen.
I didn't know of the CCN Association!  She made a report this afternoon.
So scary. Glad all who encountered him are safe! Thank you for sharing to keep us all aware
I‚Äôm always amazed at the lack of person description in these posts.  You know things like race, height and weight etc.
I'm so sorry my post was not detailed enough for you.  As I was not the one who experienced the incident I could only go off what my friend shared.  She was incredibly shaken but you wouldn't know what its like being a woman attacked.  I thought it was important to share what happened ASAP and give the details I had.  I'm sure you would be out looking for him if there was more, Larry.  Location, sex, dress, time of day... those were the details I had and it was enough to determine another incident only 2 hours prior.
To emphasize Sydney's statement...it has been discovered that screaming police causes people to make a conscious decision NOT to get involved; however, screaming fire brings peoples awareness that THEIR lives could also be in danger.  When an individual feels their lives (or better yet) their possessions are in danger they pay attention.
","Neighbor Chased by Man. My neighbor is not on Nextdoor but I wanted to share an incident.  We live off 2nd and Jackson, she was taking out her trash around 5:30pm last night in the alley between Jackson and Garfield.  A man in his late to mid 20s, wearing baggy clothing was hiding in a corner of our covered parking.  He started walking aggressively toward her and chased her up the side of our building. He stopped when he saw our landscapers out front.  No telling what he wanted but please be aware of your surroundings at all times of the day.  I'm leaving it up to her to make a police report.  Stay safe neighbors.Thank you for sharing! Scary but good reminder for us all!

Pretty sure is homeless.  Last time saw him he had started a fire in alley on east side of Congress.  Fire dept had to come and put out.
We called an ambulance for him, and he rejected them.  Someone else called an ambulance for him, and he rejected them.  There but for the grace of God go I.
I never understood that cliche. Does it mean god graced you but forgot that guy..?
Many neighbors have offered various kinds of assistance over the months.
I saw him one very cold morning and asked if I could help him in any way. He was very polite, very articulate and very firm that he wanted nothing. Said he was just waiting for the sun to come up. He was wearing a good mask, so he gets help somewhere.
His name is John. I helped him tuck some blankets under his legs and around his body. He started to tear up when I asked if he needed anything. He said no. 
I mean this without sarcasm; it sounds like someone should get John some reflective tape for his wheelchair.
Amazon has a pole with a plastic orange flag/pennant that attaches easily to a bike or wheelchair. Less than $10. I don‚Äôt live in neighborhood. Maybe someone can get it if he will agree to use it. If need be, I will order it if someone tells me to what neighbor I can deliver it. Having no rapport with him, best for him to connect with someone he knows.

7th Avenue or cross streets, Congress Park/N. Cherry Creek.
My company makes reflective bands, contact me and I'd be happy to give you some so you can give to him. I use them on my son's stroller,  they work well and attach with velcro
Thanks, Mark. And, yes, most concerned he does not get hit by a car. The reflective bands would be great. I can come by and get them or find a way to have you drop them off.
been lots of response to this.  I should correct my 1st comment - it was actually my neighbor who saw him in alley by Congress park and saw fire.  My ""first hand"" sightings have been 9th & Detroit St & numerous on 7th.  My concern is for him but also not having fires!
Thanks all. I actually work for the Coalition for the Homeless. I
Thanks Allan - for all you do with the Coalition for Homeless. Great cause to support.
UPDATE: I just read further down and found out he lost his legs to frostbite. Sorry. However, maybe that information is relevant to someone else. 
He‚Äôs been around forever, and by forever, well over 15 years.  I‚Äôve lived here all my life and he‚Äôs a staple figure.  My sister knows more about him, I‚Äôll ask her.  I know he used to go to coffee shop at the Tattered Cover when it was located in its original building in Cherry Creek.
He was staying in Pulaski Park most of last week. Spoke with him and actually told me his name is ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù. Lost his legs to frost bite. Born and raised here in Denver. Kind and very articulate. Ask if we could get him a warm sleeping bag. We talked about what type would work best because of his amputations. So a few of us got him a ‚Äúhalf bag‚Äù with suspenders to hold it up and a fleece liner...he wasn‚Äôt at the park yesterday. We are bringing the bag to Congress Park today to try to find him to give it to him. Such a sad, difficult situation...
That is a wonderful thing you folks did. Hope you find him soon.
I gave him my sandwich once and he about cried. He lives in my neighborhood and is super nice. I literally insisted he took the sandwich and he smiled so big. Keep being nice to people! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is he a veteran?  There are lots of resources to help him if he is?
No I asked how he lost his legs and he said frostbite...
Thanks to Mark for the reflective bands. I‚Äôll see if he wants them attached. Also working on outreach services.
Allan, if you manage to locate him, please let me know.I have looked for him at the Congress Park today, but couldn't find him. I have the sleeping bag that Marcia mentioned, I would love to give it to him.
We have seen him often; he seems to have good and bad days.  He seems mostly resistant to help.  He is not responsive to my amazingly kind hearted husband; a bit more to me but often refuses help.  Allan ~ I hope you can help, maybe a female volunteer.  Let us all know if we can help too.  He has such sad eyes.
I walk up/down 7th avenue and have seen him often.  From now on I will bring protein bars with me.
Thanks for thinking of this! Please be aware of the consistency of bars; many of those in need can‚Äôt chew as well as they would like.
If anyone locates him, please let me know, where exactly I can find him. I have the sleeping bag Marcia Canepa mentioned for him.
I'm wondering if the person that said they work for the coalition for the homeless would be able to offer assistance to this gentleman.Is there something we can all get together and do to help this gentleman.
I have tried to use the coalition for the homeless before and all they do is help feel out applications for apartments that have a year+ waiting list. Maybe he is a veteran?
I'm wondering if the woman that was helping the homeless man o. Mo aco and about Colfax,I'm not sure if I recall her name perhaps it was Kate might have some helpful ideas for this man. Thanks

I'm a member of this group and everyone is a volunteer like me! Just concerned citizens that feel like our voices are being ignored.  I'm volunteering this weekend to gather signatures. How is gathering signatures to put something so serious on the ballot for a public vote shaddy or underhanded? We feel the City Council's refusal to listen to their constituents was shaddy!
Clare, so will the petition all all Denver residents to vote on key decisions?
So important to research the nitty-gritty - both pros and cons - before ever signing any petition.  Have no idea what this one is, but hope it's something good and dripping with honor!!!
Safe and Sound Denver is a deceptive group that hides in the shadows.

Only if you want to make the petition seem less credible
There is also a signing event from 1-4pm on 4/17 and 4/18 at the corner of 3rd Ave and Adams st in Cherry Creek North!
Sounds to me like it gives the community more of a voice then what a select few decide is right.
Nope, that‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs about
Can‚Äôt make that date and time...other options?
Nobody's voices were ignored. Common sense and decency prevailed. Denver needs the measure the Council just adopted and people like me will continue to fight to keep it. Housing is a human right and this new rule will help, though so much more is needed.
Then why not let the citizens vote on it Lisa? If you're right then it'll pass with flying colors!
Wende Reoch so the 85% plus residents of Denver who opposed this bill are racist, bigoted assholes? Again, these are separate issues. The last I checked, the United States isn‚Äôt a socialist country. We elect people to represent us no dictate over us.  This is how government is supposed to work in our country. My intent above was and is  to point out factual realities about how our govt is supposed to operate in our country. Mixing emotional arguments and personal perceptions with facts rarely leads to a productive dialog. Yes this issue is emotional and at the same time we have a constitution, laws and other rational means in place to assure that all voices are heard and represented. I also shared above, it is impossible to offer any solution that all will be happy with as is evident here. The point of this petition is to give all residents of Denver the right to vote on this amendment that will greatly impact the city. 11 people should not have that much power over our community. You too will have the right to vote as you feel is best for the community. Finally, to make the assumption that anyone who doesn‚Äôt support this amendment is a racist bigot is actually a racist and bigoted comment as it makes sweeping assumptions about a large group of people without even knowing them. This approach also stops productive conversation from happening and keeps people divided.(edited)
85% üòÇ where do you people come up with your facts.

Aldo, I am really confused, Mayfair... is it really a neighborhood. It is not on any Denver maps. Is it a self proclaimed overlay of Montclair and Hale?
If housing policy were up to popular votes, people like me (brown, queer, born into working poor family) would still be living in the slums designated for our kind. Thank goodness civil rights and human rights are not up to popular votes. We would be a very different society if we had to wait for human decency to become popular. Learn some US history already- civil rights were ushered in by protests, endless appeals in the courts, and the votes of elected officials who were made to feel pressure. We‚Äôd still be waiting if a popular vote was required.

Lisa Ramos  That's partly why I asked how many POC are in their organization.  One of their posts here claims they've been called racist bigots, when I saw not one post doing so.  That alone hints at who they are.(edited)
Can you tell us exactly what is on this petition? Who exactly do you not want in the neighborhood?
Hello Paula. All of the information you are requesting can be found at http://safeandsounddenver.com.
I will sign this if you buy me a cheeseburger
Thank you for bringing a bit of levity to all of this. Unfortunately campaign finance laws prohibit Safe and Sound from buying you a burger
Do you think it‚Äôs fair to always have shelters, group homes and halfway houses always in marginalized neighborhoods? Seems like a different form of redlining
There is no opposition to having these group homes throughout the city, just not in single family zoned areas where transportation and services would be limited.
Dana Smart there are already integrated homes, and there are services. This is another method of redlining. There are new accessory dwelling unit rights added to single family home areas, and lots of people in our shared neighborhoods taking advantage of VRBO and Air BnB opportunities.(edited)
Lisa Ramos so true. The city‚Äôs amendment document has a community review process. They‚Äôre trying to ban clean affordable housing.if there are fears of bad corporate operations, the permitting and community review process can protest. Also worth asking: safe from whom and for whom?(edited)
Sara Henry let the citizens vote - our country elects officials to vote on measures on our behalf. Why not let US citizens vote for tobacco 21, building a stupid wall, Medicare for all, legalize marijuana. Because when people vote instead of politicians - we show a far more progressive attitude than the political balance would allow.
Patricia Smith Patricia I‚Äôm not going go back-and-forth with you. If you want to find the information you know where to get it. If you want to be concerned  about funding I would suggest you look at the big developers who bank rolled Michael Hancock for the last three cycles he has been in office. They are the ones who have destroyed our city, filled it with expensive housing, destroyed city park, intend to tear up I 70 and the Swansea a L Myra neighborhood to add more luxury development and have left our Airoirt in shambles to create shopping . Much of our present situation has been the continuation of keeping this person in office and allowing the developers to bank roll what has now created a problem in our city.
Why not share the info? Since you have served as a strong advocate for this issue, share the info and let us decide based on that. I‚Äôm not going to argue about Hancock because I‚Äôm interested in the homelessness issue not a singular politician. Why keep pushing back? I‚Äôm asking the same as what I have done, in resprct and fairness. I‚Äôve also been very straightforward about my personal mission. Please share the link so we have that accurate info. Some of what you state above resonates, so why not direct me to the source as I have done?(edited)
An important issue for the people to vote on. Let‚Äôs get it on the ballot!

Can you tell us exactly what is on this petition? Who exactly do you not want in the neighborhood?
Hello Paula. All of the information you are requesting can be found at http://safeandsounddenver.com.
I will sign this if you buy me a cheeseburger
Thank you for bringing a bit of levity to all of this. Unfortunately campaign finance laws prohibit Safe and Sound from buying you a burger
Do you think it‚Äôs fair to always have shelters, group homes and halfway houses always in marginalized neighborhoods? Seems like a different form of redlining
There is no opposition to having these group homes throughout the city, just not in single family zoned areas where transportation and services would be limited.
Dana Smart there are already integrated homes, and there are services. This is another method of redlining. There are new accessory dwelling unit rights added to single family home areas, and lots of people in our shared neighborhoods taking advantage of VRBO and Air BnB opportunities.(edited)
Lisa Ramos so true. The city‚Äôs amendment document has a community review process. They‚Äôre trying to ban clean affordable housing.if there are fears of bad corporate operations, the permitting and community review process can protest. Also worth asking: safe from whom and for whom?(edited)
Sara Henry let the citizens vote - our country elects officials to vote on measures on our behalf. Why not let US citizens vote for tobacco 21, building a stupid wall, Medicare for all, legalize marijuana. Because when people vote instead of politicians - we show a far more progressive attitude than the political balance would allow.
Patricia Smith Patricia I‚Äôm not going go back-and-forth with you. If you want to find the information you know where to get it. If you want to be concerned  about funding I would suggest you look at the big developers who bank rolled Michael Hancock for the last three cycles he has been in office. They are the ones who have destroyed our city, filled it with expensive housing, destroyed city park, intend to tear up I 70 and the Swansea a L Myra neighborhood to add more luxury development and have left our Airoirt in shambles to create shopping . Much of our present situation has been the continuation of keeping this person in office and allowing the developers to bank roll what has now created a problem in our city.
Why not share the info? Since you have served as a strong advocate for this issue, share the info and let us decide based on that. I‚Äôm not going to argue about Hancock because I‚Äôm interested in the homelessness issue not a singular politician. Why keep pushing back? I‚Äôm asking the same as what I have done, in resprct and fairness. I‚Äôve also been very straightforward about my personal mission. Please share the link so we have that accurate info. Some of what you state above resonates, so why not direct me to the source as I have done?(edited)
An important issue for the people to vote on. Let‚Äôs get it on the ballot!

19,35,35,179050512,Nolan Albrecht,Mayfair,4 Mar,"Decreased police activity. I‚Äôm sure this will make people upset, because everything really does this point unfortunately. Property crime is up 55% year over year, violent crimes are up 8.2% year over year. The police budget for Denver county is down 11% from 2020. There‚Äôs more crime than ever, and law enforcement funding is at a 10 year low. I‚Äôm sure partly due to covid and partly to social initiatives. 

It‚Äôs not that the police don‚Äôt care to come check out your suspicious activity, or my car that was broken into, but they don‚Äôt have the bandwidth and must prioritize violent crimes. It‚Äôs sad that our neighborhoods are getting less safe by the week it seems. But expecting law enforcement to reduce its funding and manpower and deal with a 55% increase in property crimes is just not fair.",decrease police activity sure people upset point unfortunately property crime % year year violent crime % year year police budget county % crime law enforcement funding year low sure partly partly social initiative police care come check suspicious activity car break bandwidth prioritize violent crime sad neighborhood get safe week expect law enforcement reduce funding manpower deal % increase property crime fair,"Nolan, you are right on the money.  And things are only going to get worse.  Under the banner of stopping police brutality, our elected officials have chosen to throw the baby out with the bath water.  Instead of dealing with the issue, which is difficult, the easy way to look like the problem is being addressed is to cut budget. Helps with city/county strained budgets in tough times also.
Did you read about the budget cut and what it is about? Or are you assuming that its due to police brutality. 
Crime has actually dropped last month. The main crime is car theft and break ins.
I was just referencing the year to date crime number provided by the Denver post
https://www.denverpost.com/2021/02/24/denver-crime-rate-homicide-shooting-property-crime-police/
https://denverite.com/2021/02/02/in-the-first-six-months-of-health-care-professionals-replacing-police-officers-no-one-they-encountered-was-arrested/
I saw this, and that‚Äôs really good news! The issue is there‚Äôs not enough bandwidth for anyone, police officer or not, to show up and investigate/ prevent these crimes. If we had police alternatives who could come help prevent crime thatd be awesome. We just have nobody showing up so criminals just get to keep committing crimes
I saw this recently as a way to get more police funding in the east colfax area: https://mobile.twitter.com/DenverCouncil5/status/1367505575945375751/photo/1
Nolan you are right on! We need more policing, not less!
If social and economic systems were stronger for people in the lower income bandwidth of our community,  if society promoted the abundance available to us, instead of highlighting lack and competion, we would naturally have less crime and need for police.
Yeah I agree entirely, but I was just merely highlighting the fact that a lot of people are complaining about a lack of representation from police officers and I was highlighting the most likely reasons. Not the economic and social culture leading to crime
Folks want more police presence, not less, and this is true across the entire demographic spectrum.
Perhaps we can all look at raising taxes folks. It‚Äôs the way a community supports these services. Without revenue cuts will continue. Write Polis and Hancock- Polis wanted to pursue a tax cut (!). Not helpful.
Well, hopefully the almost 50% property tax increase I recently voted for will help the situation.
Has anybody ever thought of how much money actually comes into this city through tickets . Fines, etc.  Maybe we could better manage our funds. And our training. And have community supports. Within ourselves to help ourselves as well.
I don't have the link with me but Denver for 2021 is expected to have ~$200M less in revenue for 2021 due to the pandemic.  Cuts are inevitable across the board.  Did the police brutality coverage have an impact on the budget?  I""m not sure but I suspect that was in the conversation.  I never supported defunding police as I still want them around, more focused should have been on on fixing the problem.  We swing left to right (not politically) and vice versa too often in today's environment and the answer is usually somewhere in between.
Thank you for this factual perspective!  I support and appreciate our officers.(edited)
Michael Chenard this seems a tad drastic...
Michael Chenard Wow!
How much did the Denver budget as a whole shrink?
It‚Äôs somewhere around $190M
There are a number of crimes DPD does not send out an officer for and it‚Äôs been like that for years.  Particularly property type crimes without a known suspect and you complete the report online.  If your car is broken into why is it necessary to have an officer come out?  I suggest attending city council meetings when they‚Äôre discussing and voting on the subject.  Last year you could attend via zoom and request time to talk about issues and concerns.  Also contact your city council official.
The post that inspired me to write this was about a guy who was wondering in their backyard and around their house for about 15 minutes checking windows while they were home
The conversation is definitely ongoing at city hall: https://www.axios.com/denver-crime-spike-police-stops-murders-7ce92619-8fa3-4766-94b5-3366fe798e33.html
Has anyone considered reviving the block captain program in our 'hood? I don't know of any currently in operation, but perhaps that's another way to add a layer of protection and look out for our neighbors.
Not sure what this is, but I would happily get up at 4:30 one morning every week or so and drive around my neighborhood. Throwing hand grenades at potential thieves üëç
Damn, only 11%? Hope they cut the budget more.
What‚Äôs the solution to crime then? We‚Äôve seen a spike in crime this year and our police force quite obviously can‚Äôt handle the volume of crime. How would you fix this

We just recently found out that a long-treasured, historical home is being torn-down. Often referred to as a ‚Äújewel of the neighborhood,‚Äù this house represents the character, uniqueness and charm that Congress Park is known for, and the reason we all have chosen to live here. Many of you who walk these streets probably know the home. You would recognize it by the double-lot it sits on, the huge shady trees, the pergola in the yard that has been there for over 100 years and the gorgeous turn-of the century architecture. Neighbors are horrified and shocked to see the demolition suddenly begin. Surprisingly, this destruction and permanent damage to the neighborhood can happen without any notice. Not knowing the ‚Äúplan‚Äù, we can surmise that this decision was made from a perspective of short-sighted values and self-serving interests. We stand with the neighbors in saying this is wrong, this is tragic and nothing about it seems just for the people who have lived in this community for many years, and want only to preserve what makes this community special.

How soon can we get a new mayor.  One who actually respects our city.  This is so sad and infuriating. And what Brenda said.
It started with the mayor but is now being steam rolled through with Andrew Webb from CPD and your City Council person, Chris Hinds. They are the people you need to contact immediately as they plan to make it even worse by approving a homeless shelter or a corrections facility on any block with the new zoning they plan to vote on Feb 8th.
I grew up across the street. I know the family tried to hold on the property for years. My parents‚Äô house was gutted. All the original built-in bookcases and credenzas ripped out. Sold for some obnoxious price. It‚Äôs definitely a different neighborhood than the one I remember.
I am so sorry to hear this - such a beautiful house. I walk by it multiple times per week because it is so lovely. Does anyone know how this got approval from the landmarks commission?
As far as I know, that address is not in a landmark district. I‚Äôm pretty sure the 7th Ave historic district ends at 8th Ave. Unless it has changed recently.
Susan Hobbins Thank you for the clarification! I mis-remembered the boundaries.
This has always been a beautiful home and garden. In the 1960s it was part of a garden tour. It was also where all the kids on the block played baseball, kickball etc.  So much history goneüò¢
Maureen, is this the Falkenburg‚Äôs house?
What a shame!  Years ago I lived at 830 St. Paul and always thought 831 across the street was the most beautiful.
I too have always loved that property. But, this is a private home. The owners decided to sell. After all, many people use the sale of the old family home to find retirement in a new,smaller place. We don‚Äôt know the reason but it would be a very rare owner who stipulates that the home must remain as is. I know nothing about the sellers or buyers - but the zoning of this double (triple?) lot allows something something new to be built. 
Beware of what you think is going to be built,
I miss the old Denver üòî
So very sad.  Not to add to this sad story, but we have heard that the vacant house (double lot) on the next street over (8th & Steele SE corner) was purchased by a questionable developer for a song from the surviving family (estate) and he plans to make an AirBnb and build what a neighbor described as a ""beach house"" (whatever that is) on the lot right on the corner at 8th Avenue.
Air b n b in Denver has to be owner-occupied.
I loved always loved this house.
So sad to hear! Walked by today and saw the ripped porch!
Does anyone know if this house was ever for sale publicly? I never saw a for sale sign but perhaps missed it. So sad.
No. It appears to be s private sale, no MLS listing.
Greed and no sense of history.  A horrible price to pay for getting properties designated as protected for their historical value.  Surprised there wasn‚Äôt some form of notice, even on a chain link fence, so concerned people could act.  Thanks for sharing.
I just googled it and it's pretty but the estimate on Zillow said 1.7 million. A single family can't afford that. I'd be surprised if anyone bought it besides a developer.
1.7 is nothing for the wealthy in Denver (of which there are many). While I‚Äôm disappointed the new owners don‚Äôt respect the home it‚Äôs entirely possible it‚Äôs a single family.
When I was selling my 1886-built house on Lincoln (the only double lot on the block), my neighbors rallied & formed a LLC and bought & restored it. They didn't want it to be scraped. Channel 9 reported on it. That block is now a historical district, which took years, but now no house on the block can be razed. 
I am unfamiliar with the history of your place but say bravo to the neighbors who created a win-win result and to you for your part in achieving the result
That's awesome. This appears to have been a private sale, no MLS listing, and likely no opportunity for the neighbors at act similarly.
It seems just like the greater world, there is a lot of anger being demonstrated here from assumptions based on zero or minimal research to the facts.
Do you know why they are tearing it down? Does it have structural problems perhaps? I‚Äôm just interested.

Honestly there are not a lot of safe places (shelters) to go to for these folks during covid. Have some understanding as to why this is happening and cut them some slack. We are all in this together.
That doesn't seem to be the case according to this article: https://www.denverpost.com/2021/01/12/mike-coffman-homeless-aurora/
your article is informative.  while i agree COVID has made this more challenging.  I also support each and every measure on our ballots to support our fellow citizens.  it is frustrating to know there are services there that aren't being accessed.
Why haven‚Äôt there been widespread COVID outbreaks in the homeless camps?
Don McDonald there have been. But the city doesn‚Äôt have any other options for them so, hand sanitizer and bathrooms have been placed in many of the camps.
It‚Äôs only going to get worse. 
Chapter 59 exemptions should be 100% done away with. Why should Green Valley Ranch get to nix homeless camps while the rest of the city bears the burden?
The crazed no-holds-barred zoning, except CH 59 neighborhoods (Hilltop...). is being voted on Feb 8th by City Council.  If you want some say in what happens in your neighborhood, contact your city counil person.
I don't consider Hilltop a great example of the former  Chapter 59 zoning designation neighborhood - there are only a couple of fairly small properties that are still in that code. There are plenty of other neighborhoods that are better examples - Lowry for one. It is good and easy to get the facts straight in this era of misinformation.  Lots of places to confirm this including the CPD website.(edited)

Yes. There's a special exemption for about 25% of Denver's neighborhoods.

Not sure, is this it??
Dedric Friedly Thanks!
No neighborhood should be exempt. (Except for council members and the mayor). Haha üò¢
Robin, Did you vote for him? If so, you probably have read his bio (I think the one I am citing was probably written by him). My guess is that he represents His own view of neighborhoods and Life and is less interested in ours. I did not receive his newsletter. Because of his personal history, he may be on a rather one-sided pilgrimage. https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-city-council/council-members/district-10.html
Ummm, that started with a loaded question that I won‚Äôt answer....all I said is that I‚Äôd be interested in reading this. That tends to be clearer info than a recap. Who I vote for is no one‚Äôs business but my own. Your vote is also your own business ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Joan what about Chris's personal history tells you he represents his own view and not yours; just curious how you came to this conclusion?
Almost none of District 10 is Chapter 59 (or HOA-controlled). Meaning Chris Hinds' neighborhood is almost certainly not exempt.
the letters received in support at the last minute weren't even Denver residents but they counted then anyway.(edited)
The goal of representative democracy is not for elected officials to rubber-stamp the will of their constituents. If it were, we would have direct plebiscites.  The founders were quite clear on this.  Your beef is not with Chris Hinds, but James Madison (See federalist #10.)
Thank you to Chris Hinds for his vote.  Plenty of his constituents & Denverites in general support his position.  
Sara Henry I think it's you. You're the problem. LOL
where is this 80% number coming from?
*motions to thin air*
Sara Henry your post misrepresents the facts and damages public trust in elected government. I hope others will inform themselves as to what actually happened.
Bryan, In what way does the post to which you refer ""misrepresent the facts""? Please post that; otherwise you are just slandering someone. Also, why cannot we all find some common ground in that no bias is needed if we see that we want our residential areas to provide cleanliness, quiet, calm. If you want excitement and noise, that is a whole new thing for our neighborhood.
sign me up for the recall! also, how were they able to exempt their neighborhoods from the increased housing limits? does anyone have the link?
They didn't. But the internet allows for misinformation amongst the communication of true information.
I certainly intend to do my own research on this amendment, but does it actually exempt the neighborhoods of city Council person‚Äòs?
Sounds like that's not accurate.
Max Boyle ---- Really?  You moved into your neighborhood ""just this last Saturday"" and you've noticed a number of your neighbors are hoity-toity and awful and THEY ALL (your caps, not mine) talk and belittle anyone different or less fortunate  Gee, you get around fast.
No you don't wish that so stop it.
Sara, let‚Äôs give it a little time. It‚Äôs unlikely the very worst thing imaginable is going to happen tomorrow. I live down the street from the Mental Health Center of Denver, a location that serves people you might be wary of, and have not seen nor heard any issues regarding tussles among neighbors and clients. Perhaps if we behaved more like a community that takes care of all our residents, we wouldn‚Äôt have so much anxiety when these issues arise.(edited)
Thank you Chris Hinds for your vote.  Denver (at least a percentage of us) appreciates all you do in moving our great city forward.
Another District 10 RNO board member and I tallied the first four public comment records a few months ago.  Our findings were similar to the ""80% opposed"" that I believe Safe and Sound Denver has been quoting.(edited)
Hi Amy - That would be 80% of those who 1) attended the meetings and 2) submitted public comment. Not of constituents. And 3) it‚Äôs not of the final amendment language. So it‚Äôs not accurate to tout this number
Anyone who listened to Chris Hinds speak before his election would understand he wants high density. His vote should not at all be a surprise to anybody. I hope it doesn‚Äôt lead to all the potential problems discussed but not hopeful given this city continues to seem to go downhill.
Let‚Äôs let him know how we feel. And he won‚Äôt get a vote from me in the future. He‚Äôs a follower not a leader.
From his newsletter: ""This survey resulted in about 1000 responses, the vast majority of which were from District 10.  On its face, a narrow majority agreed or strongly agreed with this amendment.  However, the comments showed that some of those against were opposed because this amendment, in their opinion, didn‚Äôt go far enough. ""
And the 2 at-large council members. None deserve to be reelected. I think one is term limited and will be running for mayor.
Question for the group, with the new rules, can HOA‚Äôs limit the number of non-family members living in a unit?
EXCELLENT Question, Robert.  Let's see if we get an answer.
John Sunderland short answer...yes, but not for long
Sorry, that‚Äôs exactly what I am.  However, I get that everyone does not have the opportunities that I had, check yourseld
I didn't mean you are not black, you are not special if you don't see yourself that way. I'm sorry for that.
Regina Jackson, we are neighbors in CCN. I don't know you but I respect your right to have a different perspective than many of your neighbors.  Serious question... Why can't you do the same? I've seen other ND posts from you with lots of name calling and personal attacks while you demand respect. Isn't respect a two way street? Why don't you set forth your position on the zoning amendment and argue the merits of supporting Hinds rather than spout every current social media woke derogatory term in the book at those with whom you disagree?
I have a different perspective because I am a Black woman born and raised in America

Do you happen to have a link to the newsletter? I‚Äôd be interested in reading it myselfüòä
Not sure, is this it??
Dedric Friedly Thanks!
No neighborhood should be exempt. (Except for council members and the mayor). Haha üò¢
Robin, Did you vote for him? If so, you probably have read his bio (I think the one I am citing was probably written by him). My guess is that he represents His own view of neighborhoods and Life and is less interested in ours. I did not receive his newsletter. Because of his personal history, he may be on a rather one-sided pilgrimage. https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-city-council/council-members/district-10.html
Ummm, that started with a loaded question that I won‚Äôt answer....all I said is that I‚Äôd be interested in reading this. That tends to be clearer info than a recap. Who I vote for is no one‚Äôs business but my own. Your vote is also your own business ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Joan what about Chris's personal history tells you he represents his own view and not yours; just curious how you came to this conclusion?
Almost none of District 10 is Chapter 59 (or HOA-controlled). Meaning Chris Hinds' neighborhood is almost certainly not exempt.
the letters received in support at the last minute weren't even Denver residents but they counted then anyway.(edited)
The goal of representative democracy is not for elected officials to rubber-stamp the will of their constituents. If it were, we would have direct plebiscites.  The founders were quite clear on this.  Your beef is not with Chris Hinds, but James Madison (See federalist #10.)
Thank you to Chris Hinds for his vote.  Plenty of his constituents & Denverites in general support his position.  
Sara Henry I think it's you. You're the problem. LOL
where is this 80% number coming from?
*motions to thin air*
Sara Henry your post misrepresents the facts and damages public trust in elected government. I hope others will inform themselves as to what actually happened.
Bryan, In what way does the post to which you refer ""misrepresent the facts""? Please post that; otherwise you are just slandering someone. Also, why cannot we all find some common ground in that no bias is needed if we see that we want our residential areas to provide cleanliness, quiet, calm. If you want excitement and noise, that is a whole new thing for our neighborhood.
sign me up for the recall! also, how were they able to exempt their neighborhoods from the increased housing limits? does anyone have the link?
They didn't. But the internet allows for misinformation amongst the communication of true information.
I certainly intend to do my own research on this amendment, but does it actually exempt the neighborhoods of city Council person‚Äòs?
Sounds like that's not accurate.
Max Boyle ---- Really?  You moved into your neighborhood ""just this last Saturday"" and you've noticed a number of your neighbors are hoity-toity and awful and THEY ALL (your caps, not mine) talk and belittle anyone different or less fortunate  Gee, you get around fast.
No you don't wish that so stop it.
Sara, let‚Äôs give it a little time. It‚Äôs unlikely the very worst thing imaginable is going to happen tomorrow. I live down the street from the Mental Health Center of Denver, a location that serves people you might be wary of, and have not seen nor heard any issues regarding tussles among neighbors and clients. Perhaps if we behaved more like a community that takes care of all our residents, we wouldn‚Äôt have so much anxiety when these issues arise.(edited)
Thank you Chris Hinds for your vote.  Denver (at least a percentage of us) appreciates all you do in moving our great city forward.
Another District 10 RNO board member and I tallied the first four public comment records a few months ago.  Our findings were similar to the ""80% opposed"" that I believe Safe and Sound Denver has been quoting.(edited)
Hi Amy - That would be 80% of those who 1) attended the meetings and 2) submitted public comment. Not of constituents. And 3) it‚Äôs not of the final amendment language. So it‚Äôs not accurate to tout this number
Anyone who listened to Chris Hinds speak before his election would understand he wants high density. His vote should not at all be a surprise to anybody. I hope it doesn‚Äôt lead to all the potential problems discussed but not hopeful given this city continues to seem to go downhill.
Let‚Äôs let him know how we feel. And he won‚Äôt get a vote from me in the future. He‚Äôs a follower not a leader.
From his newsletter: ""This survey resulted in about 1000 responses, the vast majority of which were from District 10.  On its face, a narrow majority agreed or strongly agreed with this amendment.  However, the comments showed that some of those against were opposed because this amendment, in their opinion, didn‚Äôt go far enough. ""
And the 2 at-large council members. None deserve to be reelected. I think one is term limited and will be running for mayor.
Question for the group, with the new rules, can HOA‚Äôs limit the number of non-family members living in a unit?
EXCELLENT Question, Robert.  Let's see if we get an answer.
John Sunderland short answer...yes, but not for long
Sorry, that‚Äôs exactly what I am.  However, I get that everyone does not have the opportunities that I had, check yourseld
I didn't mean you are not black, you are not special if you don't see yourself that way. I'm sorry for that.
Regina Jackson, we are neighbors in CCN. I don't know you but I respect your right to have a different perspective than many of your neighbors.  Serious question... Why can't you do the same? I've seen other ND posts from you with lots of name calling and personal attacks while you demand respect. Isn't respect a two way street? Why don't you set forth your position on the zoning amendment and argue the merits of supporting Hinds rather than spout every current social media woke derogatory term in the book at those with whom you disagree?
I have a different perspective because I am a Black woman born and raised in America

I‚Äôm glad you are okay, it‚Äôs so sad the homeless population in need of so much help. Yet overwhelmed with the drug addictive homeless. We feel scared, hopeless, helpless all at the same time.
Well said.
Why is this a post? Super unnecessary to call out a homeless person with dementia. I know it‚Äôs not your intention but this feels cruel and doesn‚Äôt contribute anything worthwhile.
I appreciate this post. 
My name is Bob. It wasn't me. Sad so many are struggling.
John, I beg to disagree!  I think she showed alot of compassion by actually talking to him through her window, giving him her blanket and then she asked what he needed when he came back.  She showed compassion that hopefully can be repeated by others who read this post. There was no ""calling out a person with dementia"" or cruelty here - at least not  from my perspective.  If anything it was a reminder about how so many are struggling and how we might be able to offer a little act of kindness at times.  Spread love.
But why the descriptors at the end unless she was trying to call him out? I agree she acted very nice to him, which is refreshing to see. I guess I don‚Äôt see the need to remind people or set an example of being nice to homeless, but I guess I‚Äôm too hopeful about our community.(edited)
Thank you for this info nan! I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre okay‚ù§Ô∏è
Let's all argue about if the post is calling someone out instead of asking if anyone else has seen Bob or how we could help Bob............
We (humans) have space stations and rocket ships and all sorts of crazy technology, we have the ability to nuke the entire world many many times over, yet we can't figure out how to take care of ourselves and each other and our home planet. Such a sad experiment so far as a species.
It's such a grey area. I worked as a valet downtown for five years. Spoke with plenty of homeless people just by sharing the environment. It was really surprising the amount of people describing themselves as some flavor of ""nomadic"" rather than homeless. I would describe most as coherent and competent people living out of cars/vans/tents/bicycles. But I will admit, some were aggressive and terrified me, but this is definitely not the archetypical personality.
I heard of him before he is not well :(
So sweet of you to have the blanket ready for him. I wish we had some hotels for the homeless and a taxi service you could‚Äôve called to whisk him off to safety. Somedayüôèüèº(edited)
I agree. It was like it was made just to talk crap about homeless, and stereo type them as a addict or to be little him because he had a mental health condition. How sad people get joy out of this.
What would give you the impression that anyone is getting joy out of someones suffering? Did you not read the entire thread of comments?
Read the thread. She is informing the community about this man, and is in no way belittling him. Not to mention she even helped him out by offering him a blanket. I know many others would have ignored him or even called the police on this man. The sad thing is that you‚Äôre taking this and completely spinning it to have a bad connotation, so you‚Äôre actually the problem here.
Perhaps we can turn this into something good and helpful... a blanket drive etc

They offer switch-out refill service where they replace your empty tank with a full one as well as single tank and propane delivery which is what you are looking for. Says the cost for delivering a tank and propane is around $50. I just used them for a refill the other day and it was only 10 bucks.

Thank you everyone, I found one!  I thought with Home Depot‚Äôs shipment being delayed it would be an issue across the board but it wasn‚Äôt!
","Propane tank? We went to Home Depot and they said they haven‚Äôt gotten any in three weeks. We‚Äôre looking for a 20 lb one. Anyone have any luck buying one recently?  If so,  where?!We got one 2 weeks ago at King Soopers at Leetsdale/Monaco.
Walgreens or 7-11 will have them too. We always get our refilled at Ace on the Fax.
If you have an empty you can fill it at AAA propane, Ace at Sheridan and 17th. And I'm sure there are some other propane spots around.
Ace hardware or Walmart should have them
King Soopers has them.
Thanks, everyone!  We just got a grill so we are looking for the tank too not just a refill. We‚Äôll call around to the places you‚Äôve mentioned.
Nobody physically refills them that I know of. They sell the tanks. Your first one is more expensive. After that you bring it back and get an ‚Äúexchange‚Äù‚Äîa new cylinder‚Äî that is about 1/2 as much because you returned your old cylinder.

Hi Barb,  I have donated to you before and always appreciate your efforts to help the homeless.  I'm happy to buy some Q-Tips.  They come in packs of 500.  Is this OK with you?  Do you break these down for your kits? How many do you need?
Hi Carol, 500 would be great, thank you! We can break them down when assembling the kits! Thanks so much for your donations past and present! Have a great holiday!

Thanks for posting!
Rebecca Matthys Megan Dini You guys are awesome! Did he have a good coat? If not- I can bring him one
His coat didn‚Äôt seem very substantial, so he may appreciate a new one
I have these, 2 are half full and 1 is full. Would they work with what he has? I‚Äôll put it on my porch, PM me for address... I can‚Äôt take them to him.
It‚Äôs so cold out! I have hand and foot warmers. I also have a propane heater he could use if he wants to have two. I also have one of those mini rocket stoves that burns on Thermo fuel that he could use to heat up soup or drinks. Let me know if you think any of this would help.
I gave him foot warmers, but I‚Äôm sure he would appreciate the other things.  Are you able to drop them off to him?
Yes, I can drop them by. I will message you.
I tried out the extra heater, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be working, maybe because my propane expired in 2018. I should have checked that out first, sorry about that!  Have you guys heard or seen the safe camping spaces that are supposed to be downtown? I wonder if that would be an option for him. https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/12/15/safe-outdoor-space-homeless-camp-denver/
The attitudes are so loving, I‚Äôm so encouraged!
The camping stove items are still out front here at 1555 Madison. Is anyone able to do a drop off at his tent?  I‚Äôm not dressed yet and have a newborn so I can go but it would be tricky. Let me know if anyone can do a drop.
I can come by and get them and take them to him today!
Looks like someone got them, just came by and they‚Äôre gone.  I love my neighbors!
This warms my heart.  I have been trying to extend help to him as well.  His name is Greg and I think he could definitely use a warmer coat.  I gave him some gloves.  Thank you for being a community that extends love instead of turning away
I think there is a wait list for the sanctioned camping, and women and trans people get priority over men
Actually there are two separate sites, one is just for women & trans.
I have a size XL new men‚Äôs winter coat that I could donate if anyone wants to take it to him?
Thanks for clarifying
When you have visited this person, did he tell you why his wheelchair is 8 feet away from his tent? Why haven't social services been called to visit him? did he refuse to go to a shelter? Very very sad and depressing. Anyone have any back story on why he is in this terrible situation. Oh, I see a previous posting that he has identified himself. Greg?
Greg has a friend with him that has a ‚Äúbad leg‚Äù and it is his wheelchair.  They were forced to move across the street late Friday and just dragged what they could with them.
Cynthia.  I‚Äôm not sure that wheel chair is for his own use.   He was outside his tent and mobile when I first met him.
Just took him hot soup and tea and some fruit power bars and water.,
this thread warms my heart. will try to bring him some things tomorrow! anything specific he might need other than propane?
I‚Äôm afraid the park will make him move soon, so earlier is probably better tomorrow.  I think anything that might help with warmth is most important.
Can we get him a hotel?! That is awful!  A propane stove isn‚Äôt going to help in this kind of weather.
It's kind of late, but if you can find a place and he is willing to go, I will chip in.
I am heartened by the kindness I am seeing on this thread.  There are some very malicious people who live in this area who do nothing but spew venom about the homeless and insist that they are ALL criminals and drug addicts.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if they are criminals OR drug addicts. Everyone deserves love and compassion. It is really the only thing that can change the world. That being said, I‚Äôm not going to allow a stranger in my house for my own safety. Compassion with healthy boundaries.(edited)
Thanks for letting us all know. How are they both doing? Are they actually in the tent? The wheelchair is still sitting there. Didn't Greg's friend need it in order to move?
They‚Äôve been in the tent every time I‚Äôve stopped by.  His friend can stand, but I think needs the wheelchair for walking longer distances?

My one of a kind camper was stolen from my parking spot in the alley behind my house. I've attached pictures if you've seen it or saw what happened please contact me or the Denver Police department. I've called them already and I will be filing a report. I had all my camping and snowboarding gear in it so it's a huge loss. Please help me recover it if possible.

There truly is no other camper like it.  It‚Äôs beautiful.  I‚Äôm so sorry.  I‚Äôll keep my eyes open.  Seems like you might be a candidate to get on the news as your camper is so unique.  It seems there may be a story behind it.  You might email pics to local newsrooms.  Reporters might see it.
so sorry. Terrible (and getting worse). I hope it is recovered.
What does it look like outside ?
I added pictures of the outside, not sure why they didn't upload before. Its a small teardrop trailer
Good grief, what is on in this neighborhood?
Hope you find it. Best of luck! If I see it, I‚Äôll make sure it gets back to you
Thank you. I'm really sad about it
I swear I saw this camper on cherry creek drive between Holly and Monaco last night, parked on the South side of the road next to the river. It really struck me because of the tree window and I remember thinking 'is that made of wood?!' You didn't say when it was stolen, but I saw it around 5 to 5:15 pm last night.
You are a rock star!!
I am so so sorry this has happened. I will keep my eyes out. Do you have full coverage on it?
Can you post more pics of outside?  Don‚Äôt worry I bet you get back since it will be hard to hide. The News is a great idea - send your story in so they will help spread the word.
I did now. Thanks for the heads up
i had my camper broken into, rummaged, and possibly slept in.  but not stolen. so sorry to read this.  having your things stolen really does leave you with the worst, pit in stomach, feeling.
So sorry. Don‚Äôt wait for police to check out Alison‚Äôs tip. Holler if you need help. Also, post on as many sites as possible.(edited)
Yes, agree w Carol to take a drive to Cherry Creek and the park there, per Alison's tip. Do try to get a plate number and photos if attached to a vehicle, of course. Will be watching. Absolutely beautiful camper. Am so sorry folks think this is acceptable.
Will be on the lookout!! So sorry
So sorry to hear this!
I had a hitch and a wheel lock on it.
Ugh! That sucks. I'm so sorry
This is terrible! What is going on in Congress Park? Every day, there is report after report about bicycle, truck, car thefts. Genevieve‚Äôs camper is a veritable work of art‚Äîsomething to be cherished as well as used. I hope the low-lifes who stole it do not attempt to disguise it by painting it. 
The problem is not low life‚Äôs. The problem is an economy that does not support the bottom quartile of the population.
Thank you everyone for keeping a lookout. I've found the trailer and denver Police department is here.
So happy to hear! I hope it's okay and has not been rummaged through. It's such a personal item and I can't imagine what you're dealing with
Sweet, they find a stolen purple specialized bike by chance?
They had the nerve to try and sell it
I saw this on the street too!

I'm hoping so. Waiting now while the police investigate
Great to hear it's been found so quickly. Hopefully your gear is still inside.
All the gear is gone. üò≠

I have reported this information to the police.Wow, they are not going to ever be able to claim its theirs. There truly is no other camper like it.  It‚Äôs beautiful.  I‚Äôm so sorry.  I‚Äôll keep my eyes open.  Seems like you might be a candidate to get on the news as your camper is so unique.  It seems there may be a story behind it.  You might email pics to local newsrooms.  Reporters might see it.
so sorry. Terrible (and getting worse). I hope it is recovered.
What does it look like outside ?
I added pictures of the outside, not sure why they didn't upload before. Its a small teardrop trailer
Good grief, what is on in this neighborhood?
Hope you find it. Best of luck! If I see it, I‚Äôll make sure it gets back to you
Thank you. I'm really sad about it
I swear I saw this camper on cherry creek drive between Holly and Monaco last night, parked on the South side of the road next to the river. It really struck me because of the tree window and I remember thinking 'is that made of wood?!' You didn't say when it was stolen, but I saw it around 5 to 5:15 pm last night.
You are a rock star!!
I am so so sorry this has happened. I will keep my eyes out. Do you have full coverage on it?
Can you post more pics of outside?  Don‚Äôt worry I bet you get back since it will be hard to hide. The News is a great idea - send your story in so they will help spread the word.
I did now. Thanks for the heads up
i had my camper broken into, rummaged, and possibly slept in.  but not stolen. so sorry to read this.  having your things stolen really does leave you with the worst, pit in stomach, feeling.
So sorry. Don‚Äôt wait for police to check out Alison‚Äôs tip. Holler if you need help. Also, post on as many sites as possible.(edited)
Yes, agree w Carol to take a drive to Cherry Creek and the park there, per Alison's tip. Do try to get a plate number and photos if attached to a vehicle, of course. Will be watching. Absolutely beautiful camper. Am so sorry folks think this is acceptable.
Will be on the lookout!! So sorry
So sorry to hear this!
I had a hitch and a wheel lock on it.
Ugh! That sucks. I'm so sorry
This is terrible! What is going on in Congress Park? Every day, there is report after report about bicycle, truck, car thefts. Genevieve‚Äôs camper is a veritable work of art‚Äîsomething to be cherished as well as used. I hope the low-lifes who stole it do not attempt to disguise it by painting it. 
The problem is not low life‚Äôs. The problem is an economy that does not support the bottom quartile of the population.
Thank you everyone for keeping a lookout. I've found the trailer and denver Police department is here.
So happy to hear! I hope it's okay and has not been rummaged through. It's such a personal item and I can't imagine what you're dealing with
Sweet, they find a stolen purple specialized bike by chance?
They had the nerve to try and sell it
I saw this on the street too!
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èYay! Not the brightest thieves luckily....leaving it on the street near where they stole it. May all thieves be so stupid üôèüèª
That is one cool camper! It's like a mobile Hobbit hole! Did they catch the thieves?
I'm hoping so. Waiting now while the police investigate
Great to hear it's been found so quickly. Hopefully your gear is still inside.
All the gear is gone. üò≠
Great news!üëç

Thanks Carolyn! The hygiene kits are always popular, we added masks this time. Any warm clothing, belts, socks, backpacks, gloves, knit caps, boxers, tampons/pads, sweatpants....etc.
I dropped a couple of bags last week - thank you so much for your passion to serve this community !
Thanks Tom, need more men‚Äôs items as they seem to outnumber the women....thank you
Barb, are towels ever needed?
Yes, hand towels are best as most have limited space in their backpacks or duffel bags.
I am proud of you, Barb.  That was quite a haul.  My colleague and I are Resurrection Clothing.  As such we go directly to the homeless camps with clothing, toiletries, shoes, blankets/sleeping bags, backpacks, pants, tops, and lots of jackets and coats thanks to the generosity of this community.    If Barb doesn't need the towels, we would like them, but of course she gets first dibs.

Are you in need of food? Some neighbors and I might be able to help.
Send me a PM Belinda w list of what you need. Best, Barb
Hi Barbara, how often are you dropping food/items and where? We'd like to help at least with some clothes, etc.
Hi Jen, our next distribution will be Saturday Feb 20th. This past Saturday we started at the Open Door Fellowship, but distributed the majority of food and clothing in the parking lot at Park Ave West and Stout St. If you are familiar with that area there are currently a good number of tents and makeshift dwellings on the block. It‚Äôs risky business for these folks to leave their tents and belongings, so we go to them. Anything you‚Äôd like to donate can be left on my porch. Thanks so much for reaching out, Barb
Master of headlines, indeed!  Recognized the list of items from my contributions list and felt sick that all had been‚Äôstolen‚Äô...SO thankful all went to those who need!  Great work!
I just came upon this.  Would like to know more.

500 block of Fillmore.
It took 2+ years to build the monstrosity across the street from me in the 400 block of Fillmore.  2 cute bungalows scraped to build a 3-story beautiful but inappropriate for the neighborhood. I no longer have views of the sunset.
That‚Äôs just ridiculous

Call 311 and report the address to be inspected for zoning and setback

That‚Äôs what we said 30 years ago about CCN. Progress
Yup, moved to CC in 1995 and don't go near the area if I can avoid it now.  This wonderful neighborhood has been destroyed by developers allowed to do whatever they pleased and all the small, wonderful shops and businesses have disappeared.  Will never, ever spend my time or money there--MONSTROSITIES and chains have taken over--UGHHHHH!!!
And if everyone doesn't write to their City Councilperson those monstrosities will be allowed to have 10 adults, unlimited children and unlimited cars living next to you. Andrew Webb and Co at the city plan to change zoning to almost no limits, including that home also being a homeless shelter or a correctional facility ""because we need to make every neighborhood equitable"".
I don‚Äôt think this house is being built as a homeless shelter. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Awful
The zoning changed from R-2 to G-RH-3 many years ago, probably over a decade. However it is not necessarily the zoning to blame. G-RH-3 is a multi unit district allowing urban house, duplex, and row house building forms. 
Cyndi Kemper I believe it‚Äôs right behind the apothecary. Saw it on my way to work this afternoon. Total eyesore.
This lot appears to be zoned G-RH-3, just like he majority of the CCN residential area. That zoning requires 20 ft setback in the front and 5 foot setbacks on both sides. It also permits heights up to 30 feet. Joseph Sobin is correct - if the setbacks or height 
This look like 20"" setback to you? 5' on each side?
Mayor Hancock has been extremely developer-friendly. Denver City Council lost the remaining resistance in the last City election. Many on Council argue ""great density will lead to better affordability."" There are no (zero) examples in the entire US that they cite where ""upzoning"" (allowing more units, greater heights, more people) has created affordability. They are either fooled or corrupt. They have used this period during which the city has banned large gatherings, including neighborhood meetings, to pass massive, unprecedented changes to zoning, such as the East Central Area Plan (which was designed in backrooms for over one year before the first public meeting) and East Area Plan, and soon the Group Living Amendment which combines unrelated issues. These changes, the early parts of the City's Neighborhood Planning Initiative, will bulldozed what the city's own planners call ""naturally-occurring affordable housing"" for the latest and greatest in marbles and hardwoods, all premised on the future residents choosing to use the City's subway (non-existent, not planned) to get to their jobs downtown (also non-existent). They are recreating the Denver of 1985 for 2025.(edited)
‚ÄúThey are either fooled or corrupt. ‚Äú.    CORRUPT FOR SURE.
Property owner,at 5 Cook street has applied for CMX8 rezoning.   Unlike the rest of Ellsworth from Steele to Madison that has 20 plus foot setback , this can go to property  line.

Get OVER it! This is a big city and the zoning allows for it.
Does not mean we have to like it!
So glad I am moving out of the country. Colorado has no magic anymore since I first moved here 81
I can‚Äôt imagine the changes you‚Äôve seen! I just came in 2018 and although I like it, I‚Äôm not in love; I will be leaving for either Wyoming, ID or Montana. Can‚Äôt deal with a city that doesn‚Äôt quite know how to respect its tax paying constituents while turning a blind eye to crime & homelessness. A one party system will destroy. Only takes one generation. I hail from Chicago...they have decimated our city with the bureaucracy(edited)
Time for some new blood in our local government.   Over-developing our city needs to be monitored.   We have entered times where politicians at every level are profiteering at our expense.   How did we arrive at this new deal anyway?  It happened while we were ‚Äòsleeping‚Äô.(edited)
Actually, the city council is extremely anti development and anti developer. Regulations that require developers to build affordable or pay into a fund make building new market rate housing more expensive. The city has created a long process to get any new project out of the ground. As an example, the city requires developers to build new curb and gutter in cases where the city did a poor job of the original instillation, and it doesn't have to be new construction. The process to get a plan approved is about 6 months. 6 months of carrying costs, additional expenses for ""off site"" work, pay into the affordable fund. Now the only way to build is if you can sell it for $1mil +.(edited)
It happened because of the people we elected; Jamie Gillies would have been a good replacement for Hancock, but too few people were paying attention.
Actually Hancock infused millions when he saw he was behind
Thank the city council and the mayor for being in the developers pockets for that.
Please attend a city council meeting and see for yourself if the council people are in the developers pockets. It will help you understand just how much requirement and scrutiny the city puts on developers. Better yet, speak with a developer about why they think it's nearly impossible to build new housing in Denver for middle class families. If it was possible you'd see a lot more of it.
Nearly every entity at the local level is bent on packing in as many people as possible here, while encouraging the highest possible rent, all without regard for the diminishing quality of life here in Denver. It‚Äôs tiresome for those of us who care about truly affordable housing and who also care about the character of our city. There‚Äôs lots of lip service to both from community leaders but little action in the right direction for either. Just my opinion as a 20 year resident.

At approximately 12:30pm on February 1, 2021, an approximately 40 year old male came up onto my house's front porch (historic home converted to units) and began to rummage around in far left corner where some gardening supplies are stored. He had a duffel bag over his shoulder, tucked under his coat. I observed this in person as I was sitting ten feet from the window he was in front of. I banged on the window to get his attention and gestured for him to leave the porch. He strolled off the porch and I went outside to take these photos (should he have intentions to return) as he and his female companion walked north on Clayton from 13th. Ten minutes later, the female walked by the property again alone, heading W. on 13th. When she saw me identifying her to the property owner. She stopped to yell at us, claiming harassment for taking photos and inquiring what her companion was doing on our front porch. She walked off and moments later I spotted the male on the opposite side of the street, scoping out those houses. Just not cool.

Please report.
Only crime was trespassing. I dislike feeling it necessary to share suspicious activity like this, but I dislike hearing neighbors being victims of crime even more. (And, it's downright terrifying to have a strange man peering in your window.) These are tough times for everyone and more than tough for many. Folks are desperate, yet there are resources for accessing help, too, for those who seek it. Crime is not the answer to solving one's problems.(edited)
Denver non-emergency is the best way to deal with these situations. You can press 0 and report a drone that has not yet been committed but may be in progress 720-913-2000. Good for homeless campers too

love idea!
Only if we can pet them!
I volunteer to herd the alpacas from 5am-8am every morning.
People can‚Äôt even pick up after their dogs...who‚Äôs going to pick up after the alpacas?
Employment for the homeless?
They are wonderful sweet docile creatures. I am afraid of their vulnerability if left to free roaming. They have very specific diets. They need to be treated with the care, intellect and dignity they deserve. I‚Äôm not sure having free roaming alpacas in the middle of the city would be beneficial to the animals. I believe it would be very harmful to them.
Don‚Äôt worry Connie, we‚Äôre all just being playful. It would be an nightmare to ACTUALLY populate the neighborhood with alpacas, but it‚Äôs a cute idea if you don‚Äôt think about it too hard ü§™
maybe some peacocks as well?
You've got the right idea!
They are beautiful but sooooo noisy.
Sheep, please.  They would keep everyone's grass cut.
Maybe if I count your sheep I could sleep faster :)
Someone would be posting on here with a quickness to warn you to watch your kids and pets, and be aware that alpacas carry rabies.
Lol, or that alpacas eat babies üòÇ

Sounds good‚Ä¶ until one tries to cross 6th, 17th, Colfax, or Colorado and causes a 50 car pileup
That's why we need volunteer alpaca herders.

What about keeping them away from traffic so they don't get hurt?

If the alpacas need a lot of space, i would herd then down Broad Way....

I went thru Safeway and even though it said nothing was available, I kept refreshing the page and a time popped up.

I have gotten spots for many members of my family at CVS. CVS lists spots about 4am every day.(edited)
I second the comments about trying to find an appointment very early a.m. I found mine at Walgreens in Aurora when looking at 3 a.m.

I recommend the Vaccine spotter as it will look at all sources of vaccine
I got my through UC Health. Very easy and efficient. Good luck.

I just kept refreshing on Walgreens and king Soopers and both my husband and I were able to score appts this week (scheduled on Friday)

????? What???? Where is this?
Let people be adults and make there own decisions. Stay home if ur not comfortable with others decisions. Pretty simple
It‚Äôs not clear that vaccinated people can‚Äôt transmit the virus. Wear a mask or stay home. Pretty Simple.
Their oopsie
The racist comments by them are horrible
Chris, if I could, I would paste a mask on every face I see.  Hoping you stay well in spite of people who think that making 'adult choices' includes the right to put other people's lives at risk and call it mature behavior.  
It helps to do your own research
I can‚Äôt believe they wouldn‚Äôt wear a mask upon entering only to take them off while actively eating and drinking in order for you to feel safe. These people should be shunned and no longer allowed to be on airplanes.  So sorry for your struggles.
Nice sarcasm there, Bob. It‚Äôs so people aren‚Äôt crop-dusting their virus through the restaurant on the way to the tables. Good grief, I‚Äôm not sure why caring about other people became such a bad thing to some people.(edited)
Ill fitting and poorly made masks are the virtual signaling ""do something"" price we have to pay to go out and about.  I don't know why we can't all treat them like Santa Clause and go along with the charade- before they come up with truly harmful things like cell-phone apps to track you  and put you in lock down if you get close to suspected carrier, or vaccine passports to carry around.  Hopefully for a few more months we can all just pretend that they work, and then we can have a huge bonfire, burn them, drink Corona beer and use all the hoarded TP to paper the town, just not near the bonfires.
It‚Äôs not just virtue signaling.  Masks are imperfect, sure, but they help stop the spread of the virus. Caring about your neighbor and doing your part to follow public health guidance might actually be real virtue ‚Äî too bad it‚Äôs not always the norm and too bad people who are simply doing their best not to add to the problem are denigrated.(edited)
I‚Äôm sorry Chris.  I have and will continue to comply with CDC orders in order to protect everyone.  I care about you even though I don‚Äôt know you.  I value your life.  We get our second shots this morning so soon we can FINALLY hang out with our fellow vaccinated friends at our house.  We will continue to support our local restaurants by picking up food, leaving a decent tip and bring it home.  And we will continue to have deliveries.  We will do this until we are told by our learned scientists that it is safe to do otherwise.  My husband and I do not want to be part of the problem.
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs pedantic to bring up that those are CDC guidelines and not orders.
Why am I skeptical that they were even vaccinated?   Based on their racist comments and resistance to protect others they more fit the mould of those who would refuse to be vaccinated.   So sorry you have to deal with this üò©, what sad and crazy times we‚Äôre living in.

I support you completly Chris! I just had this discussion with someone last night. Set aside Government mandates. Continue masking and social distancing to protect the spread of COVID for family, friends, and community. Just do it - damn it. We are still sick and dying.
Thank You Chris! I couldn‚Äôt agree more. How can others be so uncaring about lives other than their own and resistant to such a simple task?
I would rather have fear mongering than people dying. Everyone has a different level of health, susceptibility and risk factors for illness.  The shot takes some time to be fully effective.
I‚Äôm sorry this is happening.  My family and I are nearly all vaccinated but we will continue to mask to help our other community members who have not gotten the vaccine yet.
Cappy is correct.  And if you don‚Äôt believe Cappy, check the CDC website. It is awkward for the scientists to admit, but the reason they are still advocating that vaccinated people still wear masks is to keep it being the norm so that those not vaccinated will keeping wearing masks.  
I‚Äôm a mask wearer. Point is so many people don‚Äôt care. Complaining will do nothing. So if u don‚Äôt feel comfortable you should stay home. Heck we have two months and this is all moot
That‚Äôs right Cappy! It‚Äôs in the science
Real issue is that we aren‚Äôt addressing risk. It seems that Fauci and others are thinking that we can get to zero risk from Covid. That isn‚Äôt going to happen. Covid is going to be around, killing people, for some time.  That will go down, but it won‚Äôt go to zero. Unfortunately we live in a society that thinks we can get to a zero risk, and worse will put in place policies that are outsized to the benefits.
Yes.  There are things that arose high risk of transmission, and things that pose low risk.  The scientists are not forthcoming about what is more or less risky, so you have to do some research and put some logic in place.  Walking down the street minding your own business without a mask is VERY low risk to anybody.  It‚Äôs OUTSIDE, for crying out loud!  
Of course they take it down Betty. Doesn‚Äôt fit the left narrative.
Did you people all freak out about getting a cold before?? I can‚Äôt believe the insanity of this idiocracy. The stupid box even says it doesn‚Äôt prevent viruses. Our immune systems are amazing. If the media wasn‚Äôt pushing all this fear you wouldn‚Äôt be constantly reminded of it. If you want to wear a mask, go for it. If healthy, unafraid humans don‚Äôt wish to wear one, don‚Äôt be a jerk to them. You can stay home or whatever you wish to do. You‚Äôll be fine.
If the box is stupid, maybe it's wrong?

52,88,88,169410487,Timothy Carter,Hale,1 Dec,"Denver Homeless Out Loud. On December 15th and 16th, 2020, Federal District 10 Judge Martinez will be hearing our case against the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for violating constitutional rights by sweeping people without homes and with nowhere to go - even in a global pandemic. This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housing - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, ‚ÄúThe CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.‚Äù 

On top of this the suit addresses that, ‚ÄúOver the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (‚Äúto where?‚Äù is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).‚Äù The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can‚Äôt afford housing during this pandemic. 

Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that ‚Äúwhen I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.‚Äù Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time. 

Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. There will be a call-in number where the public can listen to the hearing. Stay tuned for this number. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to the hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place.

53,89,89,175020187,Jerson Alvarenga,Hilltop,26 Jan,"Burglary. Early this morning a crime was, again, committed at my property with a beak in and theft. Welcome to the Hunger Games of Denver and Hilltop where burglary is allowed (not to mention gun shots) and where it is treated like an expected, common occurance that is treated more like your problem rather than a crime with a criminal perpetrating violence and flauting safety not to mention the law. Your property is not respected as your property anymore and the police department will respond to the event whenever they want, even after you have called them the 5 times for 5 separate criminal events in our neighborhood on and near my property. I reported a break  and burglery on my property where over $20,000 of theft and damage was done at 3:16am this morning. The police showed up at 4:51am, 1 hour and 35 minutes later.  I thought I lived in a safe and desirable and prominent neighborhood in Denver, but it seems like it is worse than the suburbs of Newark, New Jersey, where I lived for 7 years and I never had to report any crime on or near my property. I have been in this neighborhood less than 6 months and I have had 5 official reports and nothing has happened - not one investigation has been completed on any of the incidents and I have never once recieved any progress report on any of them. I guess I will have to stop reporting these crimes and just watch it on my video cameras and let it happen. Don't waste your time on calling for the authorities for help because they won't help you, and I am speaking from my experience.

Well they don't care about us, this is my fifth report,  nothing has happened, the violence in the other hand has increased.
Crime has been historically low here so we have no substation.  Now with covid, it sometimes feels like, a free-for-all.  I have lived in the Hilltop-Crestmoor area for about 13 years and never experienced any crime/theft.  In the last 4 months, I have had at least three packages stolen from my porch.
I think your comment speak for itself,  u had suffered crime too.
This is hard even to watch! They looked ready for anything. They could kill anyone in their way! Hope you and your family are safe.
Accordingly with the police department they didn't used deadly force.
I can't believe someone has the nerve to do that, thugs. I would be pleasurable to let people like stamp license plates for a few years for acting like low life fools.
It apparently hasn‚Äôt affected me as much as you.  The police don‚Äôt have access to ND.  They can post on it but not read comments as I understand it.  From a practical perspective, I‚Äôd figure out how to lobby for a local substation for lasting change.
I told the police I was going to handle it my way when I live in Clayton and they were slow to show up. You tell a 911 answer robot person this, the popo comes running quickly to come see what's going to transpire.
but you must be truthful about being prepared to handle it yourself. If you just ""say that"" to get the cops to come out, YOU will be in more trouble than, possibly, the criminals
Mary Flower no this is real life and something that I did, I have no problems with confronting criminals in the act. And what happens, happens.
These thugs are wearing patagonia and knew to look away from the camera and to go in garage? Any chance you had workers there recently that you could have police look into? I agree crime has sky rocketed in last 2 weeks... we got hit monday at 5am but just porch pirates (white methy kids)

Please send a note to our City Council representative, Amanda Sawyer.
Amanda Sawyer is getting ready to make it worse on FEB 8th when she votes yes to changing the zoning code to 20 people in one home, shelters, and halfway houses allowed everywhere without permits. Out city council is getting ready to make a horrid situation worse. I am so sorry for this happening to you and our city that has gone to hell.

You need to put signs all around your property that's has a gun on the picture and says you don't call 911
Similarly, I visited someone's house once who had taped to the front door her paper (human silhouette) shooting target with bullet holes showing her excellent aim.  'Nuff said.
Kevin Zepp  There is one issue with this.... It can be said (and I'm just playing devils advocate here) that a sign like that proves intent. You fully intended to injure/maim/kill whoever did whatever on/to your property. In some cases it can be seen as an admission of guilt - just like the sign Beware Of Dog - you are admitting you have a vicious animal.

Very unfortunate. Wishing we could 'crowd source' this problem as a neighborhood and offer a cash reward to anyone who can identify the thieves.

In 2005 I lived in Mayfair and my home was burglarized in the middle of the day when my neighbors were home. We lost over $15,000 in property. When we arrived home and reported it to the police it took over 3 hrs for them to arrive. They told us to sit outside our home until they got there so we wouldn‚Äôt mess up the scene. Then we had to stay at a friends house until the police showed up to finger print the place. A full 24 hours later the house was finally fingerprinted, but the criminals were wearing latex gloves, so my house was obviously not their first rodeo. (They had also cut the phone line and switched off the power) At the time the police told us that there was over 30,000 burglaries in Denver annually and the police did not have enough resources to investigate crimes involving property. It sounds like a whole lot hasn‚Äôt changed. They also told us the homes that were previously burglarized were likely to be hit again because the criminals know people have insurance and will just replace the stolen stuff with new stuff. It‚Äôs sad to say but the people who break into peoples homes do this as a full time job. The best way to deter your home from being broken into is to make your house a lesser target then your neighbors which probably means putting bars on your windows and doors and a padlock on your electrical panel, which is terrible. Sorry to hear about it I know it is very upsetting.
Thank u for all the info! I'm sorry this happened to you. Do you know why they shut off the power?(edited)
That‚Äôs not true Colorado has a ‚Äúmake my day‚Äù law that allows you to shoot any person that enters your home if you feel your life is at risk. You can shoot someone through a wall without seeing or talking to them if think you are being broken into and your safety is at risk. See: https://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/31/colorado-make-my-day-law/ 
It's seems that cops don't know about that law, because they said u are not allow to do it
I just said of what they said to me.
I didn‚Äôt realize that they broke into your garage, not your home. No you can‚Äôt shoot someone that breaks into a detached garage no matter how much you would like. Looks like you need a security door on the garage, that would probably solve that problem.
Actually, that is incorrect.  Detached garages are covered under the Make my day law.   It is still considered part of the home under recent case law.   
You can protect the ‚Äúcurtilage‚Äù of your home-legal term-and it includes your garage/yard, etc. I learned it in law school 26 years ago and is still in effect
So frightening

","Burglary. Early this morning a crime was, again, committed at my property with a beak in and theft. Welcome to the Hunger Games of Denver and Hilltop where burglary is allowed (not to mention gun shots) and where it is treated like an expected, common occurance that is treated more like your problem rather than a crime with a criminal perpetrating violence and flauting safety not to mention the law. Your property is not respected as your property anymore and the police department will respond to the event whenever they want, even after you have called them the 5 times for 5 separate criminal events in our neighborhood on and near my property. I reported a break  and burglery on my property where over $20,000 of theft and damage was done at 3:16am this morning. The police showed up at 4:51am, 1 hour and 35 minutes later.  I thought I lived in a safe and desirable and prominent neighborhood in Denver, but it seems like it is worse than the suburbs of Newark, New Jersey, where I lived for 7 years and I never had to report any crime on or near my property. I have been in this neighborhood less than 6 months and I have had 5 official reports and nothing has happened - not one investigation has been completed on any of the incidents and I have never once recieved any progress report on any of them. I guess I will have to stop reporting these crimes and just watch it on my video cameras and let it happen. Don't waste your time on calling for the authorities for help because they won't help you, and I am speaking from my experience. And there is no mechanism for supplying feedback to the police department - just bureauracy that is designed to shield the department from complaints. Good luck, by the way I have to keep turning these thefts and crimes into my insurance company so the insurance prices are going up in the neighborhood as are our crime statistics which is not good for our property values. Sorry about that.We do not have a substation nearby.  That's the problem.

He lost his job in March because of COVID 19 and lost his housing .

He said he wants to keep his belonging simple because the less he has the less vulnerable he feels , he‚Äôs had other homeless steal some shoes of his feet in the night and someone actually stole his sleeping bag while sleeping in it .

Yes Kammy that would be great, anything he can store in his backpack
I can definitely come pick up just let me know when and where .
I have some men's pants too.  Whatever he can't use, would you mind giving the leftover stuff to Barb McMahon?  I will PM you.
If he changes his mind I have sleeping bag and down coat
Thank you Anne , I told him I‚Äôd keep asking him when I see him, so I‚Äôll definitely reach out again if he does change his mind .
Hi Neighbors, I visit with David most days, just got back from bringing him some supplies, food/water, socks, a cocoa thermos, a stash of hand warmers to put in his gloves/shoes and emergency blankets which are light and won't be a problem to carry or toss.  He could use a pair of shoes or boots, mens size 11...nothing too fancy as he literally has had everything taken from his backpack overnite in some parks and even the shoes off his feet.  David is 37 years old.  He said he could use a pair of pants (the pair he has on is pretty torn up with holes)--he wears a size 38x32 if anyone reading this has any on hand to donate.  His shirt is XL and a thermal or two could go a long way.  It's cold out.  Thanks for looking out for him...I've debated about posting as I don't want to cause him problems or freak anyone out.  He sits in the covered picnic area in Congress Park.  Thanks again.(edited)
Thank you Lynn!  Virginia is picking up stuff from me tomorrow, like a brand new backpack, socks, gloves, hat, winter scarfs, a mylar blanket, hygiene products, some snacks, etc.  I do have some men's clothing from my step-dad, but I think they are going to be too small.
How 'bout a coat, a lightweight, but warm Broncos jacket ?
He can be housed at national western during the pandemic- maybe talk through some options/resources?
The western stock show area was closed to men experiencing homelessness  on Aug 15,2020üò¢
Hi Neighbors,  I've looked into housing stability resources for David.  Many of the 'go-to' shelters have had a hard time accommodating our homeless due to covid restrictions and have suspended lotteries until the end of 2020.  That puts many of our at risk in a tough spot.  The last snowfall was overwhelming and there are simply not enough resources.  I cannot imagine hearing 'don't send them here' in a time of need.  That said, there is a NEW program called STAR (Support Team Alternative Response) 720-913-STAR that is a homeless outreach team whose mission is to connect people in need (not just homeless) with resources and provide a level of consistency with their care that exceeds a drive to a shelter.  They will have the most current information available whether that might be hotel vouchers/shelter updates/food supplies/etc.  The van that responds will provide a social worker and a medical professional together, not a police officer.  This resource is through the Denver Dept of Housing Stability and they are looking to expand this program, partly by disseminating this information to our community for cases like David.  I have reached out to STAR on David's behalf and I'll talk to him today about their visit.  Please keep this resource in mind and share.  Thank you again.
Hi Lynn, STAR sounds like a great option! Thanks for looking into this! The St. Francis Center might also be an option. http://www.sfcdenver.org/need-help

Hi Neighbors,  I've looked into housing stability resources for David.  Many of the 'go-to' shelters have had a hard time accommodating our homeless due to covid restrictions and have suspended lotteries until the end of 2020.  That puts many of our at risk in a tough spot.  The last snowfall was overwhelming and there are simply not enough resources.  I cannot imagine hearing 'don't send them here' in a time of need.  That said, there is a NEW program called STAR (Support Team Alternative Response) 720-913-STAR that is a homeless outreach team whose mission is to connect people in need (not just homeless) with resources and provide a level of consistency with their care that exceeds a drive to a shelter.  They will have the most current information available whether that might be hotel vouchers/shelter updates/food supplies/etc.  The van that responds will provide a social worker and a medical professional together, not a police officer.  This resource is through the Denver Dept of Housing Stability and they are looking to expand this program, partly by disseminating this information to our community for cases like David.  I have reached out to STAR on David's behalf and I'll talk to him today about their visit.  Please keep this resource in mind and share.  Thank you again.
Hi Lynn, STAR sounds like a great option! Thanks for looking into this! The St. Francis Center might also be an option. http://www.sfcdenver.org/need-help

I can‚Äôt think of a better way to celebrate the meaning of Thanksgiving than by helping Chris and Lilith get off the streets for good. I posted about them earlier in the week, and the response from the community was amazing. Many of you already said you help him regularly, which is incredible. He seems to have been homeless for quite some time. Many of you asked how to help more....

I am hoping this fundraiser will collect enough money to pay for housing (short or long-term) so that he can stabilize, find a job, and start a new life. 2020 has been filled with hard times for so many, but we do have an opportunity to change the course for this man. Let‚Äôs come together and do this! 

Happy Thanksgiving to all!!

What needs to go along with that and who can provide it (program, requirements, monitoring) so that changing his ways is more profitable (from his eyes) than begging?
Joan, No one wants to stand outside in the cold all day, ‚Äúbegging‚Äù. It‚Äôs an incredibly tough life, that is hardly profitable. He wants it to change. The money would go towards helping him secure long-term housing so that he can get a job. It‚Äôs not possible to get a steady job when you are worried about where you are going to sleep at night.
Katie Lindenberg Katie, His situation is not unlike the ones that professionals have dealt with for decades. Why not speak with some of the folks at Stout St. or another place who have experience dealing with such situations? That way you are more likely to not just feel good about helping a desperate person but learn about How to really be helpful.
I am, thank you. If you have any additional resources, please feel free to pass along. I don‚Äôt pretend to know the best way to help everyone. This is not the first homeless man I am helping, nor will it be my last. Instead of posting judgmental comments on NextDoor, I am out there trying to make a difference. If you would like to join me, I welcome the assistance. It takes a village!(edited)
Katie, I love what you are doing.   There are great resources out there, but sometimes one on one with a person needing help is the best thing for that person.  Thank you so much for ""seeing"" this man and making him feel special.
Thank you, Bonnie, for your incredibly kind message!
Thanks Katie‚ù§Ô∏è I collect clothing , toiletries, backpacks and the like for those in need at my house in Congress Park. Anything I can assist with along those lines let me know and I will drop them off with you. I avoid getting into the political aspects of the homeless situation as well, but the system is clearly broken. No one can assist every homeless person, but every homeless person can be assisted by someone! Thank you for being that someone for this gentleman. Let me know his size and I can put some things together! Best, Barb 720 224-8331

I will try and go by his intersection at 13 and Monaco tomorrow and drop off some food for him, if you think that will be welcome?
Oh yes, I‚Äôm sure he would love that.
Ok. I will pick up
Wonderful :)
Way to go Katie!!!!
Hey Katie, I read somewhere that he needed an eye exam and glasses. Some friends and myself would love to make that happen.  What is the best way to go about this?  I don't want to put extra work on you, but  would love your input on this.  Perhaps I just go and ask him?
Wow, this is amazing!!! I will message you!
","Let‚Äôs help our homeless neighbor and his pup get off the streets for good! Hi all! I can‚Äôt think of a better way to celebrate the meaning of Thanksgiving than by helping Chris and Lilith get off the streets for good. I posted about them earlier in the week, and the response from the community was amazing. Many of you already said you help him regularly, which is incredible. He seems to have been homeless for quite some time. Many of you asked how to help more....

I am hoping this fundraiser will collect enough money to pay for housing (short or long-term) so that he can stabilize, find a job, and start a new life. 2020 has been filled with hard times for so many, but we do have an opportunity to change the course for this man. Let‚Äôs come together and do this! 

Happy Thanksgiving to all!! 

Katie  

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-a-man-and-his-dog-get-off-the-streets?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1Katie, It sounds great to help him get off begging, but how is money to help him do that? What needs to go along with that and who can provide it (program, requirements, monitoring) so that changing his ways is more profitable (from his eyes) than begging?
Joan, No one wants to stand outside in the cold all day, ‚Äúbegging‚Äù. It‚Äôs an incredibly tough life, that is hardly profitable. He wants it to change. The money would go towards helping him secure long-term housing so that he can get a job. It‚Äôs not possible to get a steady job when you are worried about where you are going to sleep at night.
Katie Lindenberg Katie, His situation is not unlike the ones that professionals have dealt with for decades. Why not speak with some of the folks at Stout St. or another place who have experience dealing with such situations? That way you are more likely to not just feel good about helping a desperate person but learn about How to really be helpful.
I am, thank you. If you have any additional resources, please feel free to pass along. I don‚Äôt pretend to know the best way to help everyone. This is not the first homeless man I am helping, nor will it be my last. Instead of posting judgmental comments on NextDoor, I am out there trying to make a difference. If you would like to join me, I welcome the assistance. It takes a village!(edited)
Katie, I love what you are doing.   There are great resources out there, but sometimes one on one with a person needing help is the best thing for that person.  Thank you so much for ""seeing"" this man and making him feel special.
Thank you, Bonnie, for your incredibly kind message!
Thanks Katie‚ù§Ô∏è I collect clothing , toiletries, backpacks and the like for those in need at my house in Congress Park. Anything I can assist with along those lines let me know and I will drop them off with you. I avoid getting into the political aspects of the homeless situation as well, but the system is clearly broken. No one can assist every homeless person, but every homeless person can be assisted by someone! Thank you for being that someone for this gentleman. Let me know his size and I can put some things together! Best, Barb 720 224-8331
Thank you Barb!! I will certainly reach out when I get some more information from him. I appreciate the message very much!

Judy Lane at Blue Sky Neurology is amazing!
I looked her up based on another rec, she is not taking patients but their migraine clinic is
I would try the clinic out. Good luck! My daughter and I both struggle with migraines and it's a huge challenge!
Dr Katherine Coerver at Rocky Mountain Neurology
Full disclosure: She is a personal friend, but that means I know that she has extensive personal experience with migraines - her advice has been invaluable to my entire family over the years
Stephanie Subramanian thank you!
Try a lot of magnesium as well !
I've been trying to work my way up to higher doses. It upsets my stomach so I've been using oil
I have had migraines since a young child and tried to manage them with chiropractic care and massage with some improvement.  I started botox 10 years ago and it changed my life. Tried many other medications first but the meds definately interfered with my cognitive ability.
If you're willing to DM about it would appreciate it. A couple of people have mentioned that to me but I wouldn't know where to start
I use Dr. McNutt (neurologist) for oversight. He‚Äôs great. The reality is that migraines are individual to each person and it can take a long time to parse what‚Äôs going on (for instance, I have migraine as well as sinus and tension headaches and they all require different treatment). I always say it takes a village as my ideal formula contains chiro, massage, dry needling, Botox, migraine meds and stretching.
He is awesome
I‚Äôm going to throw something out there. I used to have what I thought were all migraines but I learned that some of my symptoms were actually related to dry sinuses from living in Denver. I learned that any time I get a headache to FIRST do some nasal washes to see what impact it has on the headache. For me, if reduced my symptoms tremendously. You will have to see how much it will help you. I never imagined it would be so helpful.(edited)
Piggybacking on this Thanks Jan, I have tried saline spray, it‚Äôs done nothing, windows open etc.
That's an interesting thought. I hadn't thought about it being sinuses because I don't have a lot of pain, just aura and sensitivity to light with weird hollow pain on one side. But I own a neti pot and I'll try ANYTHING at this point.
Gees, that is great info. My roommate has chronic migraines. As soon as she awakes, her head starts throbbing. Will try to get her to try it. Thanks. üòä
I feel your pain, and moved here 2 years ago and mine have gotten much worse.
I'm at about 18 months. I wonder if this is the Denver version of seasonal allergies.
There is a migraine clinic at CU Anschutz which may be of help.
Elizabeth, after you find a specialist, please be sure to ask about whether these are not migraines, but ""Cluster Headaches."" These are way more common that people realize, but often go undiagnosed as ""just migraines."" I went 45 years suffering from cluster headaches until I got a proper diagnosis. Your description sounds very similar to what I experienced. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache
What have you done about your CH's?  I have never had headaches my whole life until about 3 years ago.  Took about a year to diagnose as Cluster Headaches.  These are constant and debilitating!  They have really compromised my quality of life as they come on after about 1-1/2 hours of sleep and I can have as many as 6 a day.  Any ideas would be greatly welcome!!!
I second the recommendation for Trevor McNutt. He's helped me manage my migraines for over 15 years. He is terrific!
I wish I knew have been suffering from Massive migraines with Vertigo & Nausea for way too many years. Too many Drs medicines, no cure.
I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with that.  I find that the weather changing as much as it has lately really throws my migraines into gear.  I‚Äôm such a proponent for chiropractic care & massages but would also suggest looking into TMJ, food sensitivity/allergies, and earthing/grounding.
Get yourself to a good neurologist. Botox may help your headaches.
Often it has to do with narrowing of spinal column.  You might have a slight swelling or a disc is moving around.  Also-  staying away from non natural sugars helps.  Poor sleep is a big concern too. Circulation of oxygen is what is best.  That‚Äôs why message often helps.  Acupuncture has been a big relief for many. 
I absolutely love Dr Chantal O'Brian at UCHealth. She got my migraines under control. Her process was thoughtful and holistic. (She found a vitamin deficiency that was contributing to some of my issues, for example.) She isn't just a 'let's throw the latest meds at it' kind of Neurologist.
Highly recommend a publication by the American Academy of Neurology!  Comes out every two months digitally or mailed to your house...FREE!!!  Just a great read for anyone suffering from a neurological condition!! üíó
This is awesome thank you!
Also consider an Ayurvedic.
I go to Summit Headache near Swedish hospital. They really helped get my migraines under control. No caffeine really helped. Caffeine upregulates adenosine receptors in the brain. These lower your threshold for pain. So a little HA can easily become a migraine. Cut the caffeine, and your threshold gradually increases. I still get migraines, but they are rarely Big Bad Daddies any more. I also take magnesium. Also, started taking  Aimovig in the last year. It blocks the CGRP receptor. This is a preventive. It doesn't work for everyone, but for me it really slashed the frequency of migraines.

It's a good sentiment Megan, but the wealth divide and our tolerance for it have been themes of all civilizations since time immemorial. It is absolutely true that our political class has made nil efforts, and has even exacerbated (under good intentions!) the sufferings of our growing poor. Class action can't be reached through NextDoor. You have to take the initiative yourself and become the betterment in these peoples lives, you have to devote yourself to the alleviation of suffering. Why should we expect politicians to legislate humane action when we cannot even ask it of ourselves? Why constantly expect larger entitites to do things that we fail to do on a daily basis? The political class is not a separate entity from the public - they come from the public, they come from us. If our pervasive attitude is that we don't have enough individual power to enact monumental change, why should we expect our political leaders to? They are middlemen between our oligarchical interests and the facade of goodwill they must perform should they wish to remain in power. They feel as powerless as we do, but they have the resources at their hands, they have the connections they need. Recontextualizing our own ability to service those in need will actually inspire a future political class to realize they have it in themselves to do something. So long as we complain about the inaction of others to make a change in the world will be further reinforce the cynicism that pervades political and local action - that the phenoma is too large, too out of our control. The phenomena is on your corner. Give him a blanket.
Ok, I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre on the same page.
Let me be honest. We live in a cities today where a six figure income can be the poverty line. I pay over 2k a month in rent. I promise you, I don‚Äôt feel cozy or safe. I‚Äôm sometimes a paycheck away from affording groceries until the next pay day. Yet I find a way to give; sometimes more than I can afford. There are days I wonder how I‚Äôll make it to the next.

I've been thinking the same thing. We're in our warm homes, waiting for our stimulus money to come in because we have active bank accounts and addresses, and meanwhile there's so much suffering.
Appreciate you and your thoughts ‚ù§Ô∏è I just wish we, as a community, could join together to make a real difference üòî

Wait...the Denver Rescue Mission is charging $10 a night for homeless people to stay there overnight?  Seriously?  What a lot of people want is for the homeless to have a place to stay and not be creating homeless shelters in front of their homes.  What homeless person has $10 per day...$70 a week or $280 a month to pay to sleep inside for one night.  Am I missing something?
A lot have more money than you think they do
Thank you for this post. I believe dependable cleaners is also collecting and they will clean before distributing 
Could you elaborate on the $10 per night fee homeless to stay   Like Sarah Stratton I wonder how a homeless person can find $10 to stay  in a shelter.
I can‚Äôt elaborate - a gentleman told me that yesterday when he meandered into my store because he was cold. This is just a community service, If you want more information I‚Äôm sure denver rescue will answer them üíì
They (most of them) can't!! That's why they are sleeping on the streets, under bridges, etc. Those who can, even for a night or two, may pull a bit of money panhandling, picking up & selling cans. I don't know about specific shelters but I don't believe they all charge that nightly fee.
I‚Äôm happy to donate items. Please send me your address and I will go through our closets
I have items - will send a pm
If you have smaller stuff, Clothes to Kids Denver needs donations as well
Can you please dm me the details? Thank you

Very cool sounding guy. I will most definitely pay him a visit and encourage others to do the same.
While this is cool,  moreover, it is representative of the best of our humanity. I wonder what happened to us as people sometimes. I remember when I was 6 years old, (1956 for the historians out there), living in San Francisco during a time when there was no aid for parents with children in need. One particular evening when my single mother and I had only a few Lipton tea bags and a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese left in the the kitchen cabinet, we argued about who would eat it; she wanting me to have it and I insisting that she have it.  Neither of us ate that night. We did boil some water to make some tea. Even though it was the most common of teas, It was the most delicious tea ever that night . The next day she went to a job interview and fainted during the interview. The man said, ""you haven't had anything to eat have you?"" he took her to a cafe down the street and bought breakfast, he hired her and gave her an advance on her salary so she could buy groceries. I will never forget his  kindness, his humanity.

What a great example of kindness particularly in this difficult time. Peter is such an awesome soul and his food is spectacular!
Peter is so generous. I once needed a 1/2 cup of rice for a recipe and went there to buy some. He just gave it to me. And his sesame chicken is delicious.(edited)

Just wanted to share that this note was left on my RV. I usually park along Hale, but sometimes park on Bellaire St when street sweep days pop up.

I work at the hospital (for safety and privacy don‚Äôt want to share which one) and utilize my RV for sleep between shifts.

I have parked my RV here since 2018. I pick up trash in the area and try to be respectful of people and the neighborhood space. 

I have never encountered a problem before until yesterday. I was out of town for work/holiday and did not see the original note (see below) left around Thanksgiving time. Luckily I returned before my vehicle was towed for being reported as an ‚Äúabandoned vehicle.‚Äù

If you were this person or know who left this note, or in general see my RV around, I just want you to know why I park my RV here and that I hope to stay in the good graces of the neighborhood community. 

And if you see me out wiping away chalk marks off my tires, feel free to say hello!üòâ",mean leave friend want share note leave rv usually park park street sweep day pop work hospital safety privacy want share utilize rv sleep shift park rv pick trash area try respectful people neighborhood space encounter problem yesterday town work holiday original note leave time luckily return vehicle tow report abandon vehicle person know leave note general want know park rv hope stay good grace neighborhood community wipe chalk mark tire feel free,"Thanks for sharing your story snd sorry this happened to you. I no doubt have seen your RV in area described. With luck we may meet each other. :)
I live on Bellaire and have seen a few small RVs parked.  Why on earth would this be a bother to anyone? Carry on and don‚Äôt think one dissenting voice speaks for us all!
So sorry.  Things are hard enough for hospital workers these days as it is.  Thank you for your work.
Thank you for your service whatever you do At the hospital it greatly appreciated ! I live over around 14 and Milwaukee I am pretty close to several hospitals if you ever need a place to park just reach out in the comments or privately and I would be more than happy to let you park in front of my home I have two parking spots in the back of my house that I utilize so there‚Äôs never anyone parked in front of my home!
When I was in the hospital for 3 weeks I got to know some of the nurses. I can't blame you for trying to find reasonable accommodations especially when they were expected to relieve the current staff at 10pm (and likely had to get there sooner than that) and were scheduled for 12 hour shifts. One nurse lived in the Springs and I can see this as a very reasonable accommodation. It might be wise to move the RV periodically as some parking in residential areas either requires a permit or is limited to three days.
The hospital should apply for special permits for their staff during this COVID situation.  Sorry they haven't thought of this.
I love the use of our, it is ours, you included.  City sidewalks is in a Christmas song I believe. Thank you for your hard work and be well.
Sorry this happened üò¢ Thank you for all you do for the community, truly outstanding!! Made this for you, feel free to print and post on your RV :) hope you feel some love soon üíó
üëç
This is awesome!!!!
ugh, that's awful! i got a note that just said C*NT on it :(
This message, as well as your profile picture, makes me want to be friends with you.  üòÅ
Sorry for this person and thank you for working on the front lines during this crisis.
If I saw the person doing it, forget good graces. I‚Äôd straight up tell them to go pound sand. The street is in the public domain, and if you‚Äôre legally parked on it, there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it.
Sorry for the person who wrote the note. Thank you so much for your service. Hospital personnel are our front line workers. Hugs to all hospital workers!!!
If not already, I recommend you check with the local police precinct and share your story so the parking ticket trolls don‚Äôt get you. It might help to have a modest windshield sign indicating your front line role. To the note writer, a thousand fleas in their armpits.
And if you wish, pm me for a parking spot not far away.
There was an overzealous busybody on here a few months ago that saw trash in a car and was going to report it as abandoned! Not because it had been there too long. I sent a nice (really) reply and she removed her post.
Unfortunately i believe denver has a law about rv's, campers, 5th wheels etc parked on city streets. I think they only allow for so many days in same spot before u are ticketed.
I mentioned this above that on major streets they are limited to 3 days. Not sure on side streets. Still you can move the rv periodically
With current covid and homelessness issues (the later creating safe parking zones), if the police are notified by a verified frontline medical worker, it should be okay. They might even work out a street permit. I have no doubt this will come up as cases spike over the next several months. I‚Äôm happy to help take this to City Council. Sad that the hospital isn‚Äôt behind their staff about this.
that's a vigilante type thing and parking so yep you ain't alone ...
I live on 12th and Birch you‚Äôre welcome to park on my street. Also, as a side note, maybe ask the Mental Health of Denver, see if they will let you park in their lot. It‚Äôs pretty open. Thanks for all you do!
The problem Rosenda is it is not your street!
The fact that they said ""not a campground"" makes me think this is some privileged person who hates on homeless people who are suffering quite enough and they assumed an RV meant someone who was homeless.  Either way, grrr!  I'm so sorry that happened to you.
I live on Birch. We have to pay to store our rv. Not allowed in our driveway.  2 feet too long. The officer who wrote the complaint said its really only enforced if your neighbors call it in. Technically you are allowed to park on the street for a few days.Parking is hard on my street. If I kept it here, I would only have to move it every few days

I work at the hospital (for safety and privacy don‚Äôt want to share which one) and utilize my RV for sleep between shifts.

I have parked my RV here since 2018. I pick up trash in the area and try to be respectful of people and the neighborhood space. 

I have never encountered a problem before until yesterday. I was out of town for work/holiday and did not see the original note (see below) left around Thanksgiving time. Luckily I returned before my vehicle was towed for being reported as an ‚Äúabandoned vehicle.‚Äù

If you were this person or know who left this note, or in general see my RV around, I just want you to know why I park my RV here and that I hope to stay in the good graces of the neighborhood community. 

And if you see me out wiping away chalk marks off my tires, feel free to say hello!üòâThanks for sharing your story snd sorry this happened to you. I no doubt have seen your RV in area described. With luck we may meet each other. :)
I live on Bellaire and have seen a few small RVs parked.  Why on earth would this be a bother to anyone? Carry on and don‚Äôt think one dissenting voice speaks for us all!
So sorry.  Things are hard enough for hospital workers these days as it is.  Thank you for your work.
Thank you for your service whatever you do At the hospital it greatly appreciated ! I live over around 14 and Milwaukee I am pretty close to several hospitals if you ever need a place to park just reach out in the comments or privately and I would be more than happy to let you park in front of my home I have two parking spots in the back of my house that I utilize so there‚Äôs never anyone parked in front of my home!
When I was in the hospital for 3 weeks I got to know some of the nurses. I can't blame you for trying to find reasonable accommodations especially when they were expected to relieve the current staff at 10pm (and likely had to get there sooner than that) and were scheduled for 12 hour shifts. One nurse lived in the Springs and I can see this as a very reasonable accommodation. It might be wise to move the RV periodically as some parking in residential areas either requires a permit or is limited to three days.
The hospital should apply for special permits for their staff during this COVID situation.  Sorry they haven't thought of this.
I love the use of our, it is ours, you included.  City sidewalks is in a Christmas song I believe. Thank you for your hard work and be well.
Sorry this happened üò¢ Thank you for all you do for the community, truly outstanding!! Made this for you, feel free to print and post on your RV :) hope you feel some love soon üíó
üëç
This is awesome!!!!
ugh, that's awful! i got a note that just said C*NT on it :(
This message, as well as your profile picture, makes me want to be friends with you.  üòÅ
Sorry for this person and thank you for working on the front lines during this crisis.
If I saw the person doing it, forget good graces. I‚Äôd straight up tell them to go pound sand. The street is in the public domain, and if you‚Äôre legally parked on it, there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it.
Sorry for the person who wrote the note. Thank you so much for your service. Hospital personnel are our front line workers. Hugs to all hospital workers!!!
If not already, I recommend you check with the local police precinct and share your story so the parking ticket trolls don‚Äôt get you. It might help to have a modest windshield sign indicating your front line role. To the note writer, a thousand fleas in their armpits.
And if you wish, pm me for a parking spot not far away.
There was an overzealous busybody on here a few months ago that saw trash in a car and was going to report it as abandoned! Not because it had been there too long. I sent a nice (really) reply and she removed her post.
Unfortunately i believe denver has a law about rv's, campers, 5th wheels etc parked on city streets. I think they only allow for so many days in same spot before u are ticketed.
I mentioned this above that on major streets they are limited to 3 days. Not sure on side streets. Still you can move the rv periodically
With current covid and homelessness issues (the later creating safe parking zones), if the police are notified by a verified frontline medical worker, it should be okay. They might even work out a street permit. I have no doubt this will come up as cases spike over the next several months. I‚Äôm happy to help take this to City Council. Sad that the hospital isn‚Äôt behind their staff about this.
that's a vigilante type thing and parking so yep you ain't alone ...
I live on 12th and Birch you‚Äôre welcome to park on my street. Also, as a side note, maybe ask the Mental Health of Denver, see if they will let you park in their lot. It‚Äôs pretty open. Thanks for all you do!
The problem Rosenda is it is not your street!
The fact that they said ""not a campground"" makes me think this is some privileged person who hates on homeless people who are suffering quite enough and they assumed an RV meant someone who was homeless.  Either way, grrr!  I'm so sorry that happened to you.
I live on Birch. We have to pay to store our rv. Not allowed in our driveway.  2 feet too long. The officer who wrote the complaint said its really only enforced if your neighbors call it in. Technically you are allowed to park on the street for a few days.Parking is hard on my street. If I kept it here, I would only have to move it every few days

Today we had a man come threw our front door and steal a set of car keys and run away. Thankfully my roommate was in the kitchen and made eye contact with the guy. This happened around 6am this morning and the man was wearing a blue shirt and khaki pants with red/white shoes. We were able to chase the guy down held him until the cops arrived. The man is now in police custody. I am sharing this becuase the officers told us that there had been multiple break in attempts reported in the neighborhood last night. Please be careful and lock your doors.

This is terrible, I‚Äôm so sorry!!
Wow good for you!  Great job catching the guy. Did you ask him WTF he was thinking? I think I would be so curious about why the guy thought that was worth the risk.
:(
Good job
I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you!   A person with red/white shoes walked in our front door on 8/5.  Is this the same guy?
He looks very similar but this guy didn‚Äôt have any arm tattoos.
Reed Miller thanks for the reply.  So glad you caught the guy.
This is horrible, so glad you are safe! Which side of Alameda are you on?
There was a post made last night, or the night before, about an attempted armed robbery at Alameda and Eudora. They may not be connected but perhaps that poster will see this and comment.
Please keep us posted on, or whether, he is prosecuted, and if so, if he is found guilty, and if so, what the sentence is.
Wow I'm sorry that happened.
Damn! What a way to start off your day. So happy to hear that you guys were able to chase him down & get him on the ground until the police were able to arrive & take the dirt bag downtown. Hopefully he can be connected to other crimes that have been taking place around our neighborhoods. Great Job!
We had a lot of young people racing around in cars last nite between 10:30pm- 11:30 on Clermont St.Prkway. Very unnerving.
I grew up in Hilltop & I‚Äôm a 3rd generation Colorado Native. Denver is not the same city that I grew up loving. Far too many people nowadays & the crime is out of control. It‚Äôs so sad that  our City‚Äôs vibe has changed for the worst.
Eric Wakefield Let's change
Reed Miller - scary!!  was your front door unlocked or did the guy break down your front door?   You and your roommate were really on your toes.   I moved here in 1976 into Congress Park...and times have really changed since then, too.  Although there were neighborhood robberies back then.  Still not as blatant as today.(edited)
He had just unlocked the door after taking a dog outside in the morning. The man came a minute or so after he had just walked inside. The man opened the door slowly while crouching and made eye contact with my roommate in the kitchen, then grabbed the car keys that were in a tray near the door and ran, we have since changed where we keep our keys.
Reed Miller  did this guy look like a homeless person?
Also in Hilltop...2 nights ago, a man tried to jump a fence in a neighbor's backyard at approximately 7:30 pm. He didn't make it! I called the police ... be sure to keep your doors locked and let the police know when weird things are happening...
We  all  need to be on neighborhood watch during theses crazy times. We need to stick together.
Isn't that the new norm whatever the h*** you feel like feel free.   Neighborhood Watch, it's not like you can call the police or anything what are they gonna do.  They can't investigate. Just take reports after the fact
Chased him down, they say not to do that but really it's so satisfying...
WHOA...that is scary. Well done on the chase down.
This  is very scary for this to happened to you and your family I am very glad that the police department got him off the streets

I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't have money, as you probably guessed from the fact you were stealing a 22 year old jeep that you have already broken into 16 times in the last 10 years.

But what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you return my ski boots that I stupidly left in the back now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't return my ski boots, I will look for you, I will find you and I will drag you down East Colfax behind the #15.",person steal old red driveway couple hour ago know know want look ransom tell money probably guess fact steal year old jeep break time year particular set skill skill acquire long career skill nightmare people return ski boot stupidly leave end look pursue return ski boot look find drag,"I‚Äôm sorry this happened and I really hope you find them.(edited)
I am sorry this happened but you did make me laugh. I hope you get your boots and your Jeep back!
So he‚Äôs in Next Door? That is concerning(edited)
Pavel Yudanov the problem is the police don't do anything about it. When the find them they just tow them regardless of the prints they could find on stuff the idiots leave in the car but they know the cops won't do anything about it. So they'll continue to do it. They know there's no consequences unless they are caught and in reality the police don't do nothing. My jeep was stolen from my job on camera found two weeks later two miles away from.where it was stolen not far from the cop station. What did it leave me thousands of dollars behind, now a car payment that I didn't have with my jeep that I took care of the Jeep I put money into to make sure I didn't have a car payment, now I do. So I understand your frustrations I just wish the mayor the police and the state would do something about. Set up bait cars set a a task force to catch them... Just maybe when people are starting to go to jail and having to pay fines and do time the crime rate of car theft will come down.(edited)
Gosh that would be great if you find him !!  Good luck. Sorry that happened to you. It‚Äôs happening all over.  Last week someone broke my lock cylinder in my car right in front of my house   Unbelievable. I sure wished I could have caught them in the act !!
if youi didn't have a full tank of gas it will probably be found soon  trashed and swapped for another stolen ride  the cops could care less about property crimes since the summer  "" insurrection""
When my car was found 3 weeks later it had more gas then when it was stolen.  The cop was not interested at all until he saw the gas receipt from his neighborhood.  My car was filthy but not trashed.
Oh I‚Äôd be running after them w/ a baseball bat!!   Is probably collapse trying but I‚Äôd give it a good shot!!
When I was a kid my sister saw a grown man peeping in her window and ran out and told our dad and he legit ran out the door after him with a hammer in his hand.  He didn't catch him, he'd probably be in jail now if he had, but he gave it a good try. XD
In Kansas there was a rural couple that had a farm. Thieves kept
My motorcycle was stolen last month... in a paid parking garage... with cameras... and you need a phob to enter. We found it (thanks to my wife) on here within 48 hours down the street, we will do a drive by there where we found ours (Mormon church off of 7th and Holly) an inconspicuous place to hold until selling. So sorry but I also draw the line with fitted ski boots. Have faith cops said NOW 80% chance return rate.
80% chance of getting the car back?
Lee Carollo Yup, exactly! At least last month that was the return rate
I had my motorcycle stolen as well. It also was recovered a couple of blocks away. I suspect that they just want to get if away from the place it was stolen and likely have it towed later without being near the owners and drawing unwanted attention
That‚Äôs a really good point. My studio neighbor who is also my actual neighbor in some townhouses less than a block away had her husband‚Äôs work van stolen this past Fall. They found it a few blocks away about a week later. I think that‚Äôs a very good point. Look everywhere in your own neighborhood. It‚Äôs worth a shot
Jess Davis this is also a heads up for neighbors to pay attention to unusual vehicles left in the block. Could be stolen or not. But good to verify. We had a car parked in front of our house for over a week. I asked one of our neighbors if they knew who the owner was. It was actually one of the neighbors across the street who was having some work done and using the garage. So that was fine. But another time we had an abandoned car on our block. So let‚Äôs all keep our eyes open.
I‚Äôm sorry your truck and boots were stolen! I am so tired of this happening!  Can you post a picture so we all can help you find?  Baseball bat stay tuned!!!
Excellent. Liam .
This was the best post I‚Äôve ever seen on here. Or anywhere. (Very sorry about your boots/keep)
So sorry!  I feel sorrier for the thief once you catch him or her.
So sad we can't leave items on the streets or in our yards without someone stealing it  :(
Once upon a time...
Those were the good ol days! ha ha!
So sorry to hear your Jeep was stolen.  We totally understand how this feels from our own experience.  Sending warm thoughts to you and prayers that everything works out to YOUR benefit and the Jeep and those ski boots are returned post haste !!!
I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you and I hope it‚Äôs recovered. Liam would like your response.

How are cars being stolen? Doesn't take awhile to hot wire a car to steal? How can we prevent this from happening? Even if you lock your car they can still get in.
They are stealing all makes and years. If your car is outside, look into aftermarket devices to disable the ignition. Example a battery disconnect switch. Research the web for more options. This will not get any better with the unemployment problems.
Are they actually starting it?  Tow away?  Any anti theft device on steering wheel?
They are probably using one of those devices that can hijack the electronic signal from those electronic keys. That will allow them to open the door(s) and start the car to drive it away

Thank you.  l have three already and they won‚Äôt go inside
If you have one you have lots. They'll eat into everything. Decon works, period. Set it out in about 4 places. You'll never see a dead one, they leave. Dont let them ruin your things. If you feel inhumane know they will repopulate in no time somewhere else.
The problem with poison is that it also kills other animals up the food chain like hawks, eagles, fox, etc. And it can also kill innocent cats and dogs. Please don't use poison.

We mixed decon with sugar and flour to finally get rid of them. Took forever!
Marshmallow pieces on old school bar traps.
Sticky traps with peanut butter
Please don't use sticky traps if you're an even remotely decent person.
Our old rental had this issue and our landlords bought us these little white boxes we plugged into 3 outlets in the house and from the second we plugged them in I never saw another mouse ever again. Apparently they emit a sound mice hate, but our dog didn‚Äôt mind it at all. After poison, electric traps and snap traps I was THRILLED to find this solution! I think they just picked them up from Home Depot.
You are so right‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èWe have one in our family room and I have never seen a mouse in my house EVER!! I am surprised this isn‚Äôt universal knowledge!!
Leftover Easter Peeps would be good bait...........but I know Tootsie Rolls do
d-CON moves up the food chain. Please don‚Äôt poison mice.
I really don‚Äôt think it moves up the food chain. If it did, it would be a restricted use pesticide, requiring specific licenses. Make sure you check your facts before you make such claims.
Want to borrow my cats? They are good mousers!
My Russian blue just caught 3 this week. I don‚Äôt poison because if they are eaten by raptors hawks owls or cats they will likely kill them. Maybe another type ‚Äúpoison‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt kill their hunters
Chris opi name one!
We‚Äôve had two mice this winter. Nothing worked! Not the humane traps, nor peanut butter in the snap traps! But when we decided to put blackberries in the traps, success!
You need a good mouser cat , or borrow one. My Egyptian mau is a pretty good hunter. A barn cat would be good to borrow also.
As mentioned earlier poison goes up the food chain and kills our fragile ecosystem. The little noise boxes work wonders so please purchase that.  Also many cats and dogs unfortunately end up at the vets because of rodent traps.  Please be kind to animals.(edited)
The more you feed them the more they come. A trap works best and fastest. If it goes on too long you will realize that they aren‚Äôt healthy to have around. They leave pee and feces everywhere and harbor disease. Best to get rid of them fast and for good. Plugs all entry ways also.
I agree with the high frequency box. They have worked for us. This year the mice came again we replaced the boxes and haven‚Äôt seen any since.
Wire srubbies with peanut butter pushed into the mesh. The mouse will chew on the wire to get to the PB and the wire shreds will kill it from the inside
There are better ways than this inhumane solution.
This is the one I have found most effective. Pay the extra $10 for the 2000 model. I have also found that one per floor or level of the house is plenty. Good luck!
Someone may have mentioned this already, but sticky traps work great. Put them along your baseboards, especially in the kitchen or where food is. If you know where they are getting in, place them there as well. Only down side is you have to kill the mice after they get stuck to the trap. NO POISON! I had a cat die from eating a poisoned mouse.
Glue traps are incredibly and unthinkably cruel.  The mice are in a literal state of panic and they either die in this state or as you said, you come and kill them after they have suffered.  Cruel.  Mice are mammals, are sentient beings.Find another method to kill them without such cruelty.
Sticky traps are inhumane.
I agree with getting or borrowing a cat. We had a nest that my cat made short work of this winter. Killed three in 24 hours!
Just please oh please oh pleased not use glue traps!!  They are so cruel and are commonly used by exterminator companies.  De-con can be poisonous to the birds (like owls!!!) that will rat mice.  It is such a tricky problem.  The snap traps are least cruel but difficult to make them work right.  Good luck.
Omg! Yes! Agree 100%!!! Those glue traps are horrible! I was sooo heartbroken to see the torture a mouse went through on one of those at my old job. It got stuck overnight, and one of his legs had gotten ripped off trying to break free and he was still stuck and alive when we got to work in the morning. So traumatizing!
Lynelle White - I had a similar experience while working in Chicago. I was distraught and made a colleague put it out of its misery. I‚Äôll never forget that experience. üò¢

That is scary! OMG! I‚Äôm glad you are safe. UGH
Hell no!!! Literally I think if I saw this I would beat the person with a bat. I don‚Äôt even care, I would beat the hell out of anyone trying to come into my house! Good work!!! Sorry that happened, so scary!!
That‚Äôs super scary. I‚Äôm glad to hear you are safe. I would highly recommend getting some cameras around your house. It‚Äôs terrible that you would have take such steps but it may be a deterrent. It‚Äôs a blessing they rang the doorbell to wake you.

You know what right you have when they breech  your house!!!!
When you don't answer the door, it's assumed you aren't home.  At least yell through the door if someone knocks or rings the doorbell - you don't have to open it - but let them know someone is there.
So glad you are okay.  How frightening.  A 2x4 across the entire french door opening sitting in brackets on either side is a good way to secure french doors.  Also use sturdy wood pieces to block windows from being opened.  Measure what you need such as your dining room window and Home Depot will cut the wood for you. Take care.
Great idea. French doors make me nervous...they do not seem secure enough to me...
How absolutely terrifying.. thanks for reporting this.

I don't think it's you. I've had similar experiences in posting a question or comment with no responses, and I've also posted, for example asking for a restaurant with extra nice service, and it resulted in over 100 comments. Sometimes a post hits a sweet spot and sometimes people don't have a response to give.
You‚Äôve posted in the General comments...
I try to only post if I think I have something of value to offer.  That‚Äôs not too often.
I mean I don‚Äôt reply to posts often(edited)
Sometimes it just depends on the volume of other posts at the time you post yours. If there are a lot of posts that day, yours might fall to the 'bottom' of the feed for most folks and some folks won't scroll that far down. It doesn't hurt to go back to your post and reply 'bump' which will put it back towards the top again. It is also possible that people just don't have any recommendations to offer for your request, depending on what it is.

Thank you everyone! You all make valid points and I will consider all these factors when I post next time around! Thanks again
Hi Jasmine. Thanks so much for being open enough to share your experience. I moved to Denver from Canada and it took me a long time to make friends. What I learned in that experience is people mean well. They are so jammed with obligations already, they are reluctant to invest time in a new friendship. I was guilty of this in Toronto. I grew up there and had a dozen friendships I couldn‚Äôt nurture the way I wanted to because of kids and family obligations.  It took me about two years to begin to feel settled in Denver and find people I genuinely connected with. Of course this is an extra challenge now.
You are not doing anything wrong. Nextdoor has morphed into nothing more than a den full of hatemongering trolls. Hopefully this will pass, but don't hold your breath.
Well it won‚Äôt change with that attitude.... üòÄ
Maybe I don't see everything, but that feels like an extreme judgment.  It is mixed.
I don't know how I'd get through this time without help from my new friends I met on Nextdoor.  Dominique, Ellen. Jami, Megan all make up a team that continues to be great.  And--there are some laughs, which I very much enjoy.
Try posting about your support for Trump...you'll get hundreds of comments!
Follow it up with a post about how the homeless should pull themselves up by their bootstraps!
I noticed in your profile that you've asked for child care recommendations in the past. In my experience, good child care is so hard to find that it's possible no one had any leads for you. Either they just don't know, or don't want to divulge. (At least this was the case in pre-Covid days)(edited)
I‚Äôve found the posts about favorite restaurants, dentists, and salons get a lot of comments. If that doesn‚Äôt work try posting about dog leash laws.
I got answers about things like dentists and vets but then I won't get an answer on something else that means a lot to me. It's a crapshoot.
See this is great! Thank you. Communication is key.and you all are showing me the dos and donts. Lol. I guess i never considered everything.

Hi, Jasmine.  Just saying I saw your post. Hope you have a lovely day knowing that you are a valued member of the forum after all!
I see you!
","Wondering. Ive been on nextdoor for 5 yrs and everytime I post a question or ask for help about something..I get no response. I thought this was a community forum or does this forum not consider me part of the community? I see people post about the most ridiculous things and they receive over 200 comments. I post on the platform to try and become more connected with my neighbors, but I have been given the ""cold"" shoulder everytime. Can someone explain to me what I am doing wrong?You‚Äôre doing nothing wrong.
I don't think it's you. I've had similar experiences in posting a question or comment with no responses, and I've also posted, for example asking for a restaurant with extra nice service, and it resulted in over 100 comments. Sometimes a post hits a sweet spot and sometimes people don't have a response to give.
You‚Äôve posted in the General comments...
I try to only post if I think I have something of value to offer.  That‚Äôs not too often.
I mean I don‚Äôt reply to posts often(edited)
Sometimes it just depends on the volume of other posts at the time you post yours. If there are a lot of posts that day, yours might fall to the 'bottom' of the feed for most folks and some folks won't scroll that far down. It doesn't hurt to go back to your post and reply 'bump' which will put it back towards the top again. It is also possible that people just don't have any recommendations to offer for your request, depending on what it is.

Thank you, as always, for the kindness and generosity you have shown Chris.

Which (indoor) public place are folks not wearing a mask at?
Many
Oh Steve...
Pam,  I appreciate your overall concern for everyone‚Äôs health, however I think you‚Äôre misinformed about the use of masks outdoors and/or with members of your own household.  Per the CDC, masks are only necessary indoors, or outdoors when unable to maintain 6 feet or more distance for an extended period of time (not just passing by) with individuals not in your same household.
Correct. It is greater than fifteen minutes within 6 feet. Masks are actually irrelevant according to the CDC in contact tracing. In fact, you could be a  wearing a mask with someone for fifteen minutes talking to your neighbor and are considered exposed because of the length of time spent inside a distance of 6 feet. Just a heads up. It‚Äôs all about distance and time. 
I have cancer.....I walk around.....
I wish you well and may you have a full recovery. God Bless.
Me as well. I have cancer, addison's disease, a genetic clotting disorder, pernicious anemia, iron deficient anemia, and several others that although they don't cause me to be more immunocompromised make life difficult. I wear a mask for others. I hope they would do it for me. My son's FIL passed last week from covid-19.  He was in his mid 40's, healthy, and has 3 school age boys. Covid is not discriminatory. Anyone can get it and give it. 
I was given the gift of life by receiving a heart transplant and I am so grateful to my donor.  Thank all of you who wear a mask because you protect me AND you!  For those who may not wear a mask, please do not put me at risk, yourself or your loved ones.  Let‚Äôs all do the right thing and wear masks until we can get through this.  Be safe!
Uhhhh NO. You wanna not breath fresh air, thats on you. Don't push masks on people outside.
üò¶
I wish that the joggers and cyclists who hog the walking paths in our parks would wear masks! There is no way to put 6 feet between someone who is huffing and puffing on a path without a mask and anyone else on the path. This is a BIG problem in City Park. Wear your masks or don‚Äôt expect to share the walking paths with others!
Kayla Gulf I can't believe that you posted this 5 hours ago and no one has pointed out that attacking passerbys with your hose isn't the thing to do.  You could literally be charged with assault, endangering public safety, and who knows what else. Hosing down a complete stranger, outside, in the cold winter air, who is doing something that you don't agree with, but it is well within their right to do?   'd cool it with hose if I were you, before someone gets really hurt (including yourself).
I think there‚Äôs still confusion about the guidelines for outdoor mask-wearing. Before none of the guidelines included wearing a mask outside but then the local guidelines changed about a month or so ago. My understanding of the local guidelines now is that if you are in an outdoor space totally alone (with no one else around) or with your quarantine bubble you don‚Äôt have to wear a mask. But if anyone else is relatively close by you should wear a mask.  A lot of people just don‚Äôt like being inconvenienced to wear a mask, though. üò∑
Kayla Gulf I think sidewalks would definitely be in the within 6 feet category. They‚Äôre not very wide, as you say. I do think people should wear masks on the sidewalks outdoors. I agree with you about being very cautious about this all. I‚Äôve been generally wearing my mask outdoors ever since this all began. In my opinion one can‚Äôt be too cautious.  My point before about the changing regulations for mask-wearing is that I don‚Äôt think everyone is blatantly trying to challenge the guidelines and policies about wearing them. A lot of people are confused about what the guidelines are now.
For what it‚Äôs worth here is CO‚Äôs official position regarding wearing a mask üò∑ outside - stay safe.
So 6 feet away is the dividing line between no mask and mask. That makes sense!
Kayla Gulf Well, yes it does, but you be you.
I run in wash park several times a week and have to stop myself from yelling at the throngs of people mask-less. It‚Äôs infuriating!
I've stopped running in the park for this exact reason. It's just too crowded, and dodging people unnerves me and makes the run significantly less enjoyable. I run to de-stress, not get more stressed out! The only solution I've found is to avoid the park and other crowded places. I miss running in Wash Park, but it is what it is.
Robin Wells yes I‚Äôve stopped running in Cheesman for the same reason . I do the split on 7th and also walk my dog their. Both times with mask
I do not wear a mask outside and I won‚Äôt. Not unless I‚Äôm around people for more than 30 seconds passing them
So, you're saying you don't care about anyone but yourself? Do you know there are virus ""shedders""? People who have no symptoms of COVID 19, but share the virus wherever they go? Think of Typhoid Mary and what happened to her!!!
Masks are not required or needed outside ... but I put one on when I am approaching and passing someone.
That's not good enough. The virus particles can hang in the air after you're gone. Please, wear a mask all the time! Thank from all of us!
caring for one another should not be a debate.....*IF* you care for others, wear a mask.....
This gets to the core of the mask issue problem. It is taking over as the 2020 version of ‚Äúhate has no home here‚Äú virtue signaling.  It has been made abundantly clear that masks are not needed outside, except in certain circumstances that almost are never met. They surely are not met by strangers passing each other. But for some reason some people here want to take the unscientifically supported position that masks matter when we are all out walking.  Also if you have a number of conditions that make you susceptible to Covid, don‚Äôt go anywhere. Stay home. It‚Äôs your life you‚Äôre responsible for it. Between all of the online ship to home, and the curbside pick up, you can go for months without having to get within 6 feet of another individual. But then again you wouldn‚Äôt be able to complain then.
In hopes that it‚Äôll make you feel better...in a Colorado Public Radio interview the head of CDPHE said you don‚Äôt need to wear a mask when walking on the 16th Street Mall, as an example.
that‚Äôs so interesting! I wonder if that example still applies during busier times on 16th street mall, such as many people there doing Christmas shopping.
We are doing this out of love for others, even others we have never met, not for ourselves. For my nephew who has a double lung transplant because he has cystic fibrosis, for my friend who has a lobe of her lung missing and a chronic lung disease, for my cousin whose coworker in the hospital contracted Covid from a patient, brought it home to her husband and daughter who then both passed away. Do this out of your love for other people, people you may never know. Don‚Äôt do it for yourself.
Useful infographic included in an article in today's NYT
How interesting! I hadn‚Äôt seen that.
Couldn't agree more.  I walk Washington Park and the majority of people walking, running, biking are  still without a mask.  I am protecting THEM wearing my mask, I wish they would be interested in protecting others.
Not disagreeing with you, but then why do you insist on still going there if that's our reality?  I wear and advocate for masks all of the time, but they ain't gonna 100% protect you, so....
It doesn't make me feel any better! Dr. Fauci says wear the mask when outside of your home.
The good Dr is always right!

So 6 feet away is the dividing line between no mask and mask. That makes sense!
Kayla Gulf Well, yes it does, but you be you.
I run in wash park several times a week and have to stop myself from yelling at the throngs of people mask-less. It‚Äôs infuriating!
I've stopped running in the park for this exact reason. It's just too crowded, and dodging people unnerves me and makes the run significantly less enjoyable. I run to de-stress, not get more stressed out! The only solution I've found is to avoid the park and other crowded places. I miss running in Wash Park, but it is what it is.
Robin Wells yes I‚Äôve stopped running in Cheesman for the same reason . I do the split on 7th and also walk my dog their. Both times with mask
I do not wear a mask outside and I won‚Äôt. Not unless I‚Äôm around people for more than 30 seconds passing them
So, you're saying you don't care about anyone but yourself? Do you know there are virus ""shedders""? People who have no symptoms of COVID 19, but share the virus wherever they go? Think of Typhoid Mary and what happened to her!!!
Masks are not required or needed outside ... but I put one on when I am approaching and passing someone.
That's not good enough. The virus particles can hang in the air after you're gone. Please, wear a mask all the time! Thank from all of us!
caring for one another should not be a debate.....*IF* you care for others, wear a mask.....
This gets to the core of the mask issue problem. It is taking over as the 2020 version of ‚Äúhate has no home here‚Äú virtue signaling.  It has been made abundantly clear that masks are not needed outside, except in certain circumstances that almost are never met. They surely are not met by strangers passing each other. But for some reason some people here want to take the unscientifically supported position that masks matter when we are all out walking.  Also if you have a number of conditions that make you susceptible to Covid, don‚Äôt go anywhere. Stay home. It‚Äôs your life you‚Äôre responsible for it. Between all of the online ship to home, and the curbside pick up, you can go for months without having to get within 6 feet of another individual. But then again you wouldn‚Äôt be able to complain then.
In hopes that it‚Äôll make you feel better...in a Colorado Public Radio interview the head of CDPHE said you don‚Äôt need to wear a mask when walking on the 16th Street Mall, as an example.
that‚Äôs so interesting! I wonder if that example still applies during busier times on 16th street mall, such as many people there doing Christmas shopping.
We are doing this out of love for others, even others we have never met, not for ourselves. For my nephew who has a double lung transplant because he has cystic fibrosis, for my friend who has a lobe of her lung missing and a chronic lung disease, for my cousin whose coworker in the hospital contracted Covid from a patient, brought it home to her husband and daughter who then both passed away. Do this out of your love for other people, people you may never know. Don‚Äôt do it for yourself.
Useful infographic included in an article in today's NYT
How interesting! I hadn‚Äôt seen that.
Couldn't agree more.  I walk Washington Park and the majority of people walking, running, biking are  still without a mask.  I am protecting THEM wearing my mask, I wish they would be interested in protecting others.
Not disagreeing with you, but then why do you insist on still going there if that's our reality?  I wear and advocate for masks all of the time, but they ain't gonna 100% protect you, so....
It doesn't make me feel any better! Dr. Fauci says wear the mask when outside of your home.
The good Dr is always right!

I heard on the radio that crows can count.
And they can use tools - make tools out of twigs and that sort of thing to perform tasks for getting food out of tight places.  Very intelligent.

Good observation, Steve!
Everyone is a comedian today. Thanks. I need the laughs.üòä
Best of all, they have had a huge comeback after their numbers were decimated by West Nile. Certainly the coolest in the Corvid family, unlike their ill mannered Magpie cousins.
It's a bird tourist thing.  You know crowists stopping at a point of interest.
Perhaps you might consider the idea that there are massive forest fires that burned up their habitat. Maybe it is a homeless encampment for crows.

Lisa Hageman Put the pkg peaunts in a garbage bag and that won't happen.
My choice for a close by garden center is Country Fair at Quebec & Leetsdale.  
Packing peanuts are a bad idea, they'll just come to the top and create a mess for you. City Floral is overpriced. Definitely go to Country Fair on Leetsdale. Their prices are better and customer service is above par compared to City Floral. 
Instead of using packing peanuts or glass bottles but some big plastic planting pots and turn them upside down in your pots. That way less soil is required and you can move the pots around much easier.
This is what I do too!
I second country fair, on Quebec just south of Letsdale. 
Agree. I know the owners at County Fair. Great people!!!
I‚Äôve had styrofoam peanuts in my pots for several years with no trouble. They sure are lighter to lift. Maybe you need to make sure you cover them with enough dirt‚Äîat least 4-5 inches so there's plenty of room for roots to grow. I use them only in my big pots. Nick's out on Iliff and Chambers is wonderful. Their selection is phenomenal!
Use newspapers or cardboard in your pots vs peanuts
Do you get any shade from trees or buildings across the street from the hot west sun? If there are trees think leaf cover as none yet. What kind of color are you looking for? Annuals or perennials? Do you have a drip irrigation system to your pot locations or hand watering? There is a list of questions, just think through them, you will be fine. There are several good nursery‚Äôs around town, don‚Äôt plant in pots above ground until after Mother‚Äôs Day would be my suggestion, plenty of time to scope things out. ATS-Denver
Depending on the size of your pots empty beverage cans and/or empty plastic bottles with the lid on work well. I‚Äôm not a fan of styrofoam peanuts.
Not sure what size your pots will be or how close to the street alley they will be located remember the sneak thieves, thinking a good amount of dirt will make it harder for them to steal your gardening  efforts. ATS-Denver
Plantings on west side...full sun or shade? This makes a difference in watering as temps later on will be much hotter. And sadly, thieves tend to seek out and snatch your potted beauties from porches or steps. Has been happening in recent summers in my townhome complex.
Plant hardy flowers that can withstand the heat. Geraniums can withstand heat and come in all colors. Add ivy and other greens to hang off the planter. Marigolds like heat too and come in bright yellow and orange. I would also keep flowers in planters‚Äîsince we do get hail here and this way you can easily rescue them! Hanging baskets are a great option too if you have a porch or deck. Happy Planting! üå∫üåª(edited)
Geraniums help with the Japanese beetle problem too! I put them everywhere
Leah Benner Thanks for that info! I did not know that. Geraniums going on my purchase list for this spring!
As far as pots go, I put rocks at the bottom. Mainly because I have some extra gravel/flagstone pieces on my property but it helped with using less soil, helped with drainage to prevent root rot, and makes the pots heavy so less likely to get stolen. I‚Äôm a fan of Perennials so that I don‚Äôt have to replant every year, but sometimes annuals make sense for pots/flower boxes. Good luck!
I recommend using only perennials in the flower beds, they come back every year and get bigger and better each year.  For flowers beds I use grass plants in the back and some in front with a mixture of flowers.  My favorite place is Nick's Garden Center on Chambers, really nice selection and very healthy plants.  They usually have some pots already made that you can buy or duplicate if you see something you like.  For my pots I like to put a grass plant in the middle and plant the flowers around with some potato vine (comes in lime or brown) or some kind of vine you like.  Happy planting.
Nicks is my favorite since they have a huge variety and parking. I can find things there that are unavailable elsewhere
Use colorful geraniums with a mix of things like petunias amd marigold for pots... city floral also has hanging planters ( expensive) Pete‚Äôs grocery and Home Depot. Don‚Äôt plant until after Mother‚Äôs Day!!!peonies produce nice blooms as well and are perennials for your front.
Denver Botanic Gardens is a fabulous resource! It's one of the best Botanic Gardens in the US. Their big plant sale is coming up - maybe starts the 25th? It's on line this year cuz of the virus, but they sell plants they've grown themselves. 
Bloem Ups a Daisy. disks for large pots.   You can buy these disks in various sizes to place in large pots.  They are disks that fit in the pots at the level you desire then fill the pot with soil, great at preventing root rot.  You can buy them at most nursery places but Amazon is cheapest.(edited)
My peonies do GREAT on the west side of my house. showy, big blooms, great as cit flowers and to leave on the bush. So many colors to choose from and they come back reliably year after year after year. Very rewarding.

I‚Äôve been running through the Walmart‚Äôs again and those their at 1 am are gone; but I haven‚Äôt done them all.  There is a FB group called COVID Vaccine Hunters for CO.  Excellent resource and people actually finding them for you.  I found a drive through clinic in Thornton for Thursday on there last night.  I‚Äôm scheduled and once I get it for sure will be cancelling my Saturday appt at the i70 and Tower Walmart
Also, Walgreens has a very wonky scheduling system that has been full of glitches since launch.  People in CO have been walking into some Walgreens and able to get vaccinated because of their system not allowing to just schedule the first dose without scheduling second at same time that aren‚Äôt loaded or available for scheduling.  Three people were able to do this yesterday.
I went through Kaiser as a non-member and got one this past weekend.
A friend got one through the Thornton Fire department. UC@ Anschutz has a patient portal, you do not have to be a patient to sign up.
A friend sent me this website. Sometimes it‚Äôs useful, sometimes the vaccine locations get blocked. But, using this and then going to the provider website directly, I was able to get my husband his vaccine.  You need to be diligent... just because they have no vaccines at 9 am. Doesn‚Äôt mean that more won‚Äôt show up at that same location later in the day.   
Kaiser, health one, Centura, UCH, your own doctor, pharmacies. Dr B is a new site that matches people with vaccines that were not claimed or used before they expire.
King Soopers too.
Signed up for vaccine clinic at Brookfield Public Health last night.  Shot tomorrow. They had open slots.
Here‚Äôs a great list that was on another post.  
I‚Äôve been trying to get my folks appts. I spoke to Walgreens and they said the state pulled their contracts. So, the sites that show they have them, don‚Äôt actually have them
Check the numerous ones above.
Try King Soopers and be willing to go to any store that shows appointments.  We got ours in Brighton.
Once your group is eligible, keep checking SCL‚Äôs website for vaccine appointments. They will have appointments available and not necessarily let you know.

Seems Walgreens system is overloaded. Scl health is full... I‚Äôve been on vaccinespotters... nothing. Any ideas or tips from people that have gotten theirs?Try Denver health!
Last night Walmart had dozens of openings at multiple locations for next Monday.  Aurora locations, Westminster and around there.  Their system is easy to use to check different locations.  You must have a Walmart.com account to schedule
We had good luck with safeway.

Are you looking for testing or for the vaccine ?
Omg I meant vaccine haha
Are you in the current eligibility group? I signed up with SLC for when my group starts 3/21, they also have an on call list for times they have extra
I‚Äôve been running through the Walmart‚Äôs again and those their at 1 am are gone; but I haven‚Äôt done them all.  There is a FB group called COVID Vaccine Hunters for CO.  Excellent resource and people actually finding them for you.  I found a drive through clinic in Thornton for Thursday on there last night.  I‚Äôm scheduled and once I get it for sure will be cancelling my Saturday appt at the i70 and Tower Walmart
Also, Walgreens has a very wonky scheduling system that has been full of glitches since launch.  People in CO have been walking into some Walgreens and able to get vaccinated because of their system not allowing to just schedule the first dose without scheduling second at same time that aren‚Äôt loaded or available for scheduling.  Three people were able to do this yesterday.
I went through Kaiser as a non-member and got one this past weekend.
A friend got one through the Thornton Fire department. UC@ Anschutz has a patient portal, you do not have to be a patient to sign up.
A friend sent me this website. Sometimes it‚Äôs useful, sometimes the vaccine locations get blocked. But, using this and then going to the provider website directly, I was able to get my husband his vaccine.  You need to be diligent... just because they have no vaccines at 9 am. Doesn‚Äôt mean that more won‚Äôt show up at that same location later in the day.   
Kaiser, health one, Centura, UCH, your own doctor, pharmacies. Dr B is a new site that matches people with vaccines that were not claimed or used before they expire.
King Soopers too.
Signed up for vaccine clinic at Brookfield Public Health last night.  Shot tomorrow. They had open slots.
Here‚Äôs a great list that was on another post.  
I‚Äôve been trying to get my folks appts. I spoke to Walgreens and they said the state pulled their contracts. So, the sites that show they have them, don‚Äôt actually have them
Check the numerous ones above.
Try King Soopers and be willing to go to any store that shows appointments.  We got ours in Brighton.
Once your group is eligible, keep checking SCL‚Äôs website for vaccine appointments. They will have appointments available and not necessarily let you know.

I was on the 16th st mall last night and didn‚Äôt see a single cop. Usually this is well patrolled. Did see several derelicts and open drug use. Glad so many people want less cops protecting ‚Ä¶ ops not protecting us
Richard Boehm I do think this is in retaliation to defund the police. No one wants it gone just not a military force shooting people. There's no in-between it seems.
You stated they tried a couple of times to back up and escape - does that mean that they were apprehended, Stan?  Hope so.
Stan, so sorry. Cristin
They don‚Äôt care. My car was stolen in the neighborhood in a gated garage! Took them 5 hrs to call me to say they aren‚Äôt able to come out but I can give my report over the phone and file that way, then there was/is surveillance video once again unable to come get it to send it via email. It‚Äôs been a week and no one has been in contact with me and when I call they seem clueless on what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs ridiculous and they don‚Äôt care about anything apparently. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you.
Now a response that confirms the current stare of affairs....
Read that there was i believe 354 car thefts in 2019, 6578 in 2020 and 6669 in just the first 3 months of 2021. Welcome to the new reality of Denver.
In 2019 that was probably a monthly average.. Denver has been in the top 20 for auto theft for years. But the numbers have skyrocketed from 2020 to this year for sure. With so many car thefts daily DPD can‚Äôt keep up and don‚Äôt do much about it
Absolutely madness. That 6,000 plus doesn‚Äôt include attempted theft huh? I was around town and I noticed so many door lock cylinders are missing on older cars. I hate that Denver is like this.
So sorry this is happening. Elections have consequences. Vote.
Also we need to change the rules on how ballot measures are written for voters.  They use misleading language and double negatives so that people think they are voting one way but are actually voting opposite their intention.  Another issue for another Post.
So defunding the police was a bad idea? Who would of thought
Honestly I feel like we are living in a bad movie.
You have to vote and change this administration.  Also, police can't be afraid to do their job.
Most do not care anymore due to what happened last year.  Most are quitting.  They have no support.
A bullet came through our kitchen window last summer. Right where I stand and wash dishes. Thank God I wasn‚Äôt up at 4am
Wow.  Yes thank God!
OMG - glad you're okay...
I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you . I‚Äôm glad you are ok. The mayor has ruined this City and is beyond corrupt . 
My parked Audi3 on so Pearl side street was totaled by a texting driver. Both cars totaled. Police said if no injuries, to call in and report.  No live police   
Defund, degrade, vilify all the same thing. Cool internet search to find 3.5% though. I couldn‚Äôt think of a worse job in liberal city than be a cop.
With reduction in effective police support, we can expect many issues with trying to receive the same protection as in the past. Too many shootings and murders receive the priority support.
I am not interested in reducing our police force...just interested in keeping  any knees off NECkS  and by NOT being shot when moving away from the officers. Judgement/knowledge enters here, of course.  Chasing a violent criminal or petty thief ?
That is, on it's face, not what ""defunding"" means.  If that's all people want, they should come up with an accurate description and stop demonizing cops.
Truck ran into the tree in front of our house in the middle of the night a few years ago and the guys who had stolen it ran off when I went out there. DFD was here within minutes; took DPD at least another 20 to show up.(edited)

With the abundance of grocery pick ups and Amazon deliveries, we‚Äôre acquiring a back log of plastic bag recycling items. The city says Whole Foods and Target has receptacles for these, but I haven‚Äôt been able to find them. Nor does the staff seem to understand what I‚Äôm asking for. 

Does anyone have a good lead on where I can drop these? I hate to put them in landfill. 
Thanks!!There are usually receptacles specifically for plastic bags outside of King Soopers stores. I drop mine off at the KS off of Leetsdale and Cherry.
Sprouts at Colfax/Garfield has a collection container. It is outside the door
We've been having the same issue! I'm glad to see there are a few places we can take them. Thank you friends!!
King Soopers on Krameria at 14th also has a marked container just outside the main door.
People really appreciate them at dog parks. Just hang at the gates.
KS on Leetsdale, Safeway at Lowry but not at Safeway on S. CO. I got turned away there.
Target in Glendale - recycling bins are inside the store between Starbucks/customer service/optical shop and restrooms/alcohol sales
Sprouts on Colfax!
Literally ANY grocery store or Walmart.
The target in glendale has a receptacle for plastic bags.
The ‚Äúun‚ÄùSafeway has them, too, where you pick up a cart in the vestibule of the store.
You can‚Äôt miss the plastic bag receptacles at target right in front where everyone checks out to pay. Near optical....
Seriously not hard to find as I‚Äôm seeing in these comments above
Thank you so much for your positive insight! When the pandemic is over, we‚Äôll all have to get our eyes checked at that optical office and then hopefully we‚Äôll be able to find them! Sorry to bother you with our inquiry.
The Safeway off of park ave has a place to drop them
King Soopers at 29th and Quebec or at 13th and Krameria have drop boxes too.
King Soooers on Krameria has two outside front door.
Plastic ones can be stuffed into doggy poop bag vessels on the streets if you have to resort to something!

Disconnect or remove the battery.
Go up to auto zone on colfax and get the club they have several reasonable models under 50 dollars. After they stole my truck I did that and put a disconnect module in fuse box that disables the ignition unless you have a special key fab with you in the truck.
You can also get a Club from the police department for free!
How does one obtain one from them?üòä
What‚Äôs the deal with all the stolen pick up trucks lately?
They're being used in burglaries
They probably have bolt cutters, so a chain might not do much.  Disconnect the battery and remove it. Also pull out the spark plug wires, then they‚Äôll have to push it if they really want it.
CW..Most people aren‚Äôt familiar with the firing order of their distributors which is why I wouldn‚Äôt recommend removing spark plug wires.
The coil wire is quickest to remove that can be replaced quickly for each trip, at least until some sort of kill switch is installed.
Find out which of your fuses controls the ignition and remove that.
Good idea Aaron, and your hands stay clean!
Put a BIG dog on the end of that chain !!
Ha ha ha!!! Best recommendation so far!

104,167,167,154753901,Candace Sake,Mayfair,13 Jul,"Verizon 5G buried in our yard without notice. Hi neighbors!

We returned from our wedding weekend to find an unknown entity has buried a coffin-sized concrete container in our front lawn without our consent.

We‚Äôve received zero communication. No brochures, emails, calls, or even a knock on the door about it‚Äîand my emails to the Denver permitting folks have gone unanswered for two weeks now.

We thought it was an eyesore as is, but according to the construction folks that stopped by this morning, it turns out they may add some type of 5G pole as well.

It‚Äôs been a bit of a nightmare and we feel violated as homeowners.

Is anyone experiencing something similar in their yard or near them?

We are trying to find out who we can contact at the City of Denver or Verizon. Thanks in advance for any leads on who we can talk to to at least get an explanation.",g bury yard notice neighbor return wedding weekend find unknown entity bury coffin sized concrete container lawn consent receive communication brochure email call knock door email permit folk go unanswered week think eyesore accord construction folk stop morning turn add type g pole bit nightmare feel violate homeowner experience similar yard try find contact thank advance lead talk explanation,"I would not be happy about that either. Keep us posted on anything you discover.
Candace, the same thing happened to us. I sent you a DM outlining what we know. Have you heard of anyone else who this has happened to?
Thank you Michael! Not yet, but I‚Äôve spread the word here and at my Denver-based company. Let‚Äôs keep in touch and work together on this. It‚Äôs pretty outrageous.
Candace Sake We also have it in our yard/sidewalk in Hilltop.  The workers who installed it said it was internet for the school. Didn‚Äôt realize it was 5G...
I would seek legal council immediately.  The fallout from the electrical waves apparently are very very dangerous.
I agree, Gretchen. I work at a cyber security company with exceptionally intelligent technologists and even they are not confident in the safety. 
It is not ‚Äò in your yard‚Äô  It is in the public right of way. Don‚Äôt have to like it, but it is not going anywhere. Get used to it. This project was approved a long time ago.(edited)
but it looks like it's in the grass on her side of the sidewalk...is that public right of way?
Contact your city council member
Great idea. Working on that now. Thank you!
Put one in our front hellstrip as well. No advance warning at all.  Verizon's contract is with the state of Colorado, not the city, though they will claim that this is city property.  Soon you'll have a shiny new cell tower in your front yard to go with it. Sadly, no one has had any luck fighting any of this.
They have contracts with every city that is approved for the small cell towers. All carriers are doing this and approved for towers. I worked when the agreements got approved for these cell towers. They are in most all major cities.
Ha ha ha ""hellstrip""! I've never heard that term before, but I love it!!
They probably have a utility/cable/communication easement and don‚Äôt need consent.
I think you‚Äôre right about that sadly.
Candace Sake it seems they almost have free reign with an easement. I think the only requirement is they clean up the mess they made.
Candace, I worked for Verizon in the 5G department and many poles have gone up over the past couple years. All of the sites are in the right of way which is owned by the city of Denver. It‚Äôs very unfortunate because they have been in residential area in front. Of home owners. But the areas are approved by the city and they make sure they aren‚Äôt on property lines. There has been several lawsuits filed by residents against the city for these poles , but I don‚Äôt think residents will win the war on it. Since it is the city‚Äôs property technically. Bright side- you will have insanely good service!
Appreciate the added context. Thank you Sara! 
The problem of getting ANYONE to answer the phone has never been worse than it is now: the city, Sears Repair Service for starters, and the booby prize goes to VERIZON. This is partly Pandemic, I realize, but the increasing difficulty of any communication that isn‚Äôt between machines is starting to get scary!
Agreed! We have been diplomatic and yet still can‚Äôt get anyone to pick up the phone. I think that‚Äôs been the worst part.
There may be another one a couple blocks up 10th at 1000 Locust too. I have not confirmed it, but there had been a large concrete box sitting in their yard just beside the sidewalk (by the stop sign) for a few days. I thought to myself how rude of the city to place something on a private lawn like that - but I assumed it was maybe a temporary storage container. And then one day it was gone - but it did not occur to me until I saw your note that it may have been buried. If it is another one, then I guess we can expect 5G towers every couple blocks? Ridiculous effort for what will surely be a fad that vanishes as soon as the next technology arrives.
Yah, It sounds like the folks up the street have also been affected. 
Dig it up and take it back to Verizon.. lol!(edited)
I genuinely have thought about that! Haha.
Maybe you have already seen this article, since it is old. But it sounds like there is no ""recourse"" so to speak, for homeowners. https://www.denverpost.com/2019/10/07/denver-cell-poles-verizion-berkeley/(edited)
Appreciate you passing the article along! I will say, it is terrifying to see a picture of what this pole is going to look like. It‚Äôs going to dwarf the poor house.
Also, here is a map of all ""small cell"" locations https://geospatialdenver.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=038ec7144de44eddbc473f28c18bf73e
OOoo the map gives me some hope! It doesn‚Äôt look they have a giant pole planned? Hard to say. The guy this morning said to prep for a large pole. 
I‚Äôm not entirely sure, but does this qualify as easement rather than public right of way since it‚Äôs in our yard rather than in between a sidewalk and the street?
That is public Right if way. The city owns 6‚Äô from the street.

Nobody gets survey plats any more. Kadastral surveys used to be required in selling a property and they showed property lines, easements, corner markers and things like that.
Those sure would have been helpful. I think we would have passed on the corner lot had we have known.
Candace Sake what is so bad about corner lots?  The mega walkways they put in now?
Very concerning and unfortunate.  I am noticeably sensitive to RFs.  Not healthy for anyone.  At *very least* those residing in close proximity are informed in advance.(edited)
Totally agree. I work with a brilliant technologist and this was his advice.
I would be concerned about being that close to that type of technology and any long term health hazards.
We absolutely agree with you. Corporations don‚Äôt have a good track record of looking out for consumers. We are bummed about being forced to be their guinea pigs.
Not sure where this is in your yard, however, there is an easement on every property that can and may be used for utilities.  Definately call the City or Verizon.
Such a bummer! Trying to track a good phone number down. Wish me luck.
Candace Sake They were marking water lines in our street to install one of these today. We're at 25th and Leyden. Please let us know what you find out. Would love to see where/when/what is going in.
Be sure to read your home sale closing documents (inclusive of the easement access you have already granted) before you spend any $.
True, easement info might be in there but a survey is much better. Like they say, one picture is worth 1000 words and the legal description of an easement will talk about survey points and degrees of turn. It's hard to understand those even if you know what they're talking about.

107,170,170,162282386,Sara Henry,Cherry Creek North,23 Sep,"Email to Chris Hinds re: Group Living Zoning Amendment. Hello Teresa:

As Chris and your office is well aware, the talk of the town and certainly the district that Chris represents is consumed with the proposed changes to the zoning laws that will effect almost all (not the lucky/privileged 20% that will be excluded) of our neighborhoods.  The overwhelming majority of the people with whom I‚Äôve spoken and as evidenced by the vast majority of opinions of the public, object to every aspect of the proposed changes as written as being beyond grossly excessive, prejudicial and dangerous to our communities.  Many of the voters/citizens are absolutely willing to accept and support some of the changes that are reasonable, but the proposal as written is simply obscene.

I was unable to attend the recent Zoom meeting hosted by Chris so I reached out via Nextdoor to ask which council members have publicly stated their positions in regards to the zoning changes.  The response I received is that Chris is in favor of the entirety of the zoning changes as presented.

Will you please tell us in writing where Chris stands on the most important issue that will affect our neighborhoods for years to come?  Is he: 1) in favor of all of the proposed changes in their entirety; 2) in favor of some of the changes, and if so, which portion of the changes does he support/oppose and why; 3) in favor of delaying all of the proposed changes so further community input/evaluations can be made; or 4) in favor of allowing the citizens of Denver to vote on such a life-altering critical issue?

Please provide us with a written response so that I can post Chris‚Äôs position on Nextdoor.  The fact that this late in the game we are unsure of where our Denver City Council members presently stand on this issue is grossly unfair to the public that elected them.  

Sara A. Henry",email office aware talk town certainly district represent consume propose change zoning law effect lucky privileged % exclude neighborhood overwhelming majority people speak evidence vast majority opinion public object aspect propose change write grossly excessive prejudicial dangerous community voter citizen absolutely willing accept support change reasonable proposal write simply obscene unable attend recent meeting host reach ask council member publicly state position regard zoning change response receive favor entirety zoning change present tell write stand important issue affect neighborhood year come favor propose change entirety favor change portion change support oppose favor delay propose change community input evaluation favor allow citizen vote life alter critical issue provide write response post position fact late game unsure member presently stand issue grossly unfair public elect a.,"I will of course post any response that I receive from Chris's office.  Teresa is Chris's senior assistant and has been responsive to me in the past on other community issues.  I would like to encourage other people in different districts to likewise reach out to their ""representatives"" to obtain answers on their positions on this issue.
Thank you Sarah! I‚Äôm in complete agreement with your concern and discussed along with the lack of representation that we are receiving from Chris Hinds. I would like to know who he is speaking with and who he is truly representing because my neighbors are feeling the exact same way. This egregious proposal being shoved down our throat‚Äòs that doesn‚Äôt serve the residents living in this community needs to be stopped. Well we all understand that our city is growing and our needs are changing, this still does not justify all of these measures that have been poorly thought out, lack credible documented justification, and ignore the concerns of the residents who pay his salary!!
Thanks so much for your prompt response Teresa.  Your office has always been very responsive when I have reached out and I greatly appreciate that fact.  Unfortunately the public that responded to inquiry as to Chris‚Äô position on Nextdoor were incorrect.  That‚Äôs why posting Chris‚Äô position (or lack thereof at this point) set forth in your email is very helpful.
See Chris's office response to my email above received in less than 5 minutes of sending it to them.  I am relieved to hear that Chris is seeking more input!  Please note that as I said in response to Teresa's email, I have only had prompt and thoughtful responses from his office so please do not hesitate to contact him (teresa's email is attached to the top of her response) and make your opinion's known.  Also, I find Chris's ongoing newsletters extremely informative so definitely sign up for them if you have not done so already.
Here for all of it a written and hoping that Chris Hinds continues his support. The elitist fearmongers may be dominating the conversation but many of us support updating these rules to address the real needs in our community.
I guess you don‚Äôt own a home then
Stop this!!
I‚Äôm still not clear on what the expectation is from a survey considering there were already 4000 comments that are available for every City Council member to read. In addition, the Land, Use, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee (LUTI) met with Andrew Webb on September 1st and questioned him about the concerns regarding the proposal development process and the proposal in its current state. I have some of the transcript that contains the LUTI Committee‚Äôs valid questions, comments and the answers from Webb and other city officials.

Hello Sara Henry,
Can you let me know in nutshell form what is being proposed and  why it is opposed.
I strongly oppose the proposed Text Amendment.
Sir,
‚ÄúThe overwhelming majority of the people with whom I‚Äôve spoken‚Äù
My neighbors David. I didn't realize that it was my responsibility to canvas everyone in every neighborhood in order to state that the people with whom I've spoken are opposed. I did not say everyone in Denver is opposed. You're certainly welcome to voice your own opinion to your council member as I suggested everyone do.(edited)
Complete agreement with post and have written Teresa/Chris many times.
Consider this: the Apartment Association of CO wrote in their industry publication that new builds and planned new builds - in these city planing areas - WILL NOT MEET POPULATION GROWTH NATIONALLY.
This is a perfect example of how the city doesn‚Äôt consider what‚Äôs reasonable in a civilized society. It is on the subject of bathrooms in their summary. The requirement is ONE bathroom whether there are 5 residents or 20. That should work out well during a health crisis.
Guaranteed housing is my idea of reasonable in a civilized society. This won't come close but if a few friends want to share a bathroom to keep the rent down then where is the harm?
This thread is so bizarre. So far I‚Äôve been called a radical, pot smoking, real estate developer who spends all day playing video games in my basement and wants to ruin the neighborhood by allowing 30 felons to move in next door. Have a good night folks!
David,
Jane Skarka Not white Jane. Not a Trump supporter either. Get your facts straight.
Our city needs more housing, badly. I support this change.
Hello Annie,
What also continues to be lost is that our country is a Republic where our elected officials are in office to execute the desire and will of the people. Their job is not to decide and implement what they think we should have imposed upon us. The feedback from the people clearly shows that the present proposal doesn‚Äôt represent the majority of the people and their concerns.

I'll consider supporting this when ALL neighborhoods are equally effected. No bullshit exemptions for certain neighborhoods (that just so happen to be where our mayor and some city council members live). I'm tired of our local government setting rules that they personally don't have to follow or deal with. It stinks of hypocrisy.(edited)
The reality is that it will never be equitably spread anyway since there are 900+ HOAs in the city and those are private Agreements between property owners and the HOA. Many HOAs have the number of residents per household in their covenants. If an HOA says max 1.5 residents per bedroom, the city cannot tell the HOA to increase the number. If they don‚Äôt amend this and make it less extreme, I suspect there will be more HOAs formed to control it within neighborhoods. That issue, along with the exempt parts of the city, make this a proposal that isn‚Äôt very effective at spreading a solution across neighborhoods.
Thank you for posting this.
I‚Äôll run for district 10 next. This guy performs poorly for you all.
","Email to Chris Hinds re: Group Living Zoning Amendment. Hello Teresa:

As Chris and your office is well aware, the talk of the town and certainly the district that Chris represents is consumed with the proposed changes to the zoning laws that will effect almost all (not the lucky/privileged 20% that will be excluded) of our neighborhoods.  The overwhelming majority of the people with whom I‚Äôve spoken and as evidenced by the vast majority of opinions of the public, object to every aspect of the proposed changes as written as being beyond grossly excessive, prejudicial and dangerous to our communities.  Many of the voters/citizens are absolutely willing to accept and support some of the changes that are reasonable, but the proposal as written is simply obscene.

I was unable to attend the recent Zoom meeting hosted by Chris so I reached out via Nextdoor to ask which council members have publicly stated their positions in regards to the zoning changes.  The response I received is that Chris is in favor of the entirety of the zoning changes as presented.

Will you please tell us in writing where Chris stands on the most important issue that will affect our neighborhoods for years to come?  Is he: 1) in favor of all of the proposed changes in their entirety; 2) in favor of some of the changes, and if so, which portion of the changes does he support/oppose and why; 3) in favor of delaying all of the proposed changes so further community input/evaluations can be made; or 4) in favor of allowing the citizens of Denver to vote on such a life-altering critical issue?

Please provide us with a written response so that I can post Chris‚Äôs position on Nextdoor.  The fact that this late in the game we are unsure of where our Denver City Council members presently stand on this issue is grossly unfair to the public that elected them.  

Sara A. HenryI will of course post any response that I receive from Chris's office.  Teresa is Chris's senior assistant and has been responsive to me in the past on other community issues.  I would like to encourage other people in different districts to likewise reach out to their ""representatives"" to obtain answers on their positions on this issue.
Thank you Sarah! I‚Äôm in complete agreement with your concern and discussed along with the lack of representation that we are receiving from Chris Hinds. I would like to know who he is speaking with and who he is truly representing because my neighbors are feeling the exact same way. This egregious proposal being shoved down our throat‚Äòs that doesn‚Äôt serve the residents living in this community needs to be stopped. Well we all understand that our city is growing and our needs are changing, this still does not justify all of these measures that have been poorly thought out, lack credible documented justification, and ignore the concerns of the residents who pay his salary!!
Thanks so much for your prompt response Teresa.  Your office has always been very responsive when I have reached out and I greatly appreciate that fact.  Unfortunately the public that responded to inquiry as to Chris‚Äô position on Nextdoor were incorrect.  That‚Äôs why posting Chris‚Äô position (or lack thereof at this point) set forth in your email is very helpful.
See Chris's office response to my email above received in less than 5 minutes of sending it to them.  I am relieved to hear that Chris is seeking more input!  Please note that as I said in response to Teresa's email, I have only had prompt and thoughtful responses from his office so please do not hesitate to contact him (teresa's email is attached to the top of her response) and make your opinion's known.  Also, I find Chris's ongoing newsletters extremely informative so definitely sign up for them if you have not done so already.
Here for all of it a written and hoping that Chris Hinds continues his support. The elitist fearmongers may be dominating the conversation but many of us support updating these rules to address the real needs in our community.
I guess you don‚Äôt own a home then
Stop this!!
I‚Äôm still not clear on what the expectation is from a survey considering there were already 4000 comments that are available for every City Council member to read. In addition, the Land, Use, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee (LUTI) met with Andrew Webb on September 1st and questioned him about the concerns regarding the proposal development process and the proposal in its current state. I have some of the transcript that contains the LUTI Committee‚Äôs valid questions, comments and the answers from Webb and other city officials. Every Councilperson has access to that full transcript. All of the same feedback was also shared, both pro and con, on the D10 Zoom meeting last week. Polling results about supporting or opposing it is meaningless if only a small percentage of 50,000 adults in D10 people respond.

Thank you for starting this discussion! It sure highlights how women have borne a huge burden this past year, and continue to bear enormous losses. A huge sector of talented and hardworking employees is lost because of misguided policies.(edited)
I am very liberal in my political views, but I may not be ‚Äúwoke.‚Äù I don‚Äôt quite get what is offensive. Isn‚Äôt the point being made in this very brief article is that working women are hit inordinately hard during these times (not only because of traditional nurturing ‚Äúduties,‚Äù but also because of the effects of a long history of workplace discrimination)? Is that not reality?
Randall, being very liberal in your political views...do all kinds of alarms bells not go off when you read this?
There is nothing at all offensive about this story. (Edit here...I'm taking issue with ""She-Cession"" because it implies a choice when there isn't one.) The story recognizes once again how Covid magnifies that women have three jobs, and something has to give. I‚Äôm offended by those who don‚Äôt understand the story. Some families aren‚Äôt privileged enough to make it on a single salary, or must have 2 or more jobs to pay for housing, food, and health insurance. A truly sobering statistic...the previous national jobless claim report had 800,000...all women.(edited)
Patricia you are missing the point entirely.  Do the names ""Common Sense Institute"" and ""Executives Partnering to Invest in Children"" sound at all suspicious?  What is the real agenda here?  You can be sure that agenda is not at all aligned with the interests of ""working women"".  Do you find it suspicious that the Child Benefit was not mentioned?  That race or income divisions were not mentioned?  Im not being glib here... read it again and see what you think
I don't find it offensive. You have a right to.
The only thing distasteful to me is the  headline of the piece, which was likely not written by the author. It‚Äôs FOX ; what do you expect? The findings of the research seem sound. My only quibble with the orgs that sponsored the research is they seem to expect business to shoulder all the financial burdens currently borne by women/families ( childcare, etc), as opposed to government, as is the case in most industrialized countries, where ample parental paid leave, subsidized quality childcare, and other assistance to families with kids are standard. The US gives lip-service to being pro-child and pro-family, while doing the bare minimum to actually support parents in successfully raising small children.
Eve, my contention runs the other way.  These groups want to address the problem (a problem they created) on their terms.  They definitely do NOT want to shoulder the financial burden of transitioning the US to those western industrial models you mention.  That involves taxation.  They want private sector initiatives and so on.  Which, to be perfectly clear, means the following: Not only do they not want to be taxed to pay for this, they want to remove this from the public sector altogether and make money off of providing that service.  At least that is my reading
The crux of the matter is the classic ""second shift"" of home and child responsibilities that fall disproportionately on working women. It's been under study for decades; the pandemic has just added to the ongoing reality of what working mothers face.
COVID has magnified the second shift, and in fact added a third: childcare/education. A paying job outside the home, the larger burden of the household, and the children.
The October 2020 employment report made headlines far beyond the business pages...more than 800,000 WOMEN could NOT sustain the Third Shift. Keep in mind some are single parents who had to begin unemployment benefits...they had to choose between the work outside the home and caring/educating children. THIS is the real story. Employers in some situations laid off those workers because the juggle wasn't working. The headline in this link is also misleading: ""Dropped out of the labor force"" does not tell the entire story. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/865000-women-dropped-out-of-the-labor-force-in-september-2020.htmlhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/865000-women-dropped-out-of-the-labor-force-in-september-2020.html
I don‚Äôt find it offensive and I respect those of you that do regardless of whether or not I understand why. I have always been among the working class and I‚Äôm also a single mom. After the pandemic everything got more challenging for everybody especially our kids who were forced into school electronically. It‚Äôs been a learning experience for both us parents and our kids. I‚Äôm out of work right now full time (I have part time flexible employment) and it‚Äôs certainly not paying the bills living where there is an inflated cost of living so I apply for numerous full time roles every week. I‚Äôm doing this because my daughter is back in school. I have a hard time seeing what juggling full time employment and her doing home school looks like so I get the article. I welcome any feedback that explains why the article has the potential to be offensive though. Be safe.

The full transcript of that interview addresses many of the points discussed above.
As a working mom and entrepreneur who has become almost full-time childcare over the last year, I do not see how this is offensive. It's true. If the truth offends you, that might be something to look at? 
Amanda, I thought the same at first, and I appreciate that CJ did later offer up more detailed commentary. It appears that most of us in this string have found common ground about the very difficult position of mothers who are working not just the  ""first and second"" shift, but the third in childcare and education during their own full-time work.
The wording is offensive and I didn‚Äôt see the article accounting for women that started their own business or for those that work virtually for national companies based in other states or even international ones while living in Denver. So they are not in the work force? It might show in their federal tax returns but not on the state tax return. But yes, some women had to spend more time giving child care and did not return to, for those I would not call it a she-cession but a recession just like for men that can‚Äôt go back to work for any reason. I know fathers that don‚Äôt work and mothers that do. Tired of this story that only women are caregivers, written by a woman!
I am 63 years old. I did not want to give my kids to daycare or other people to take care of them. We juggled. My husband had a full-time law practice. I had a business we shared but I ran. Sometimes I couldn't work regular hours so I would go into work 10PM and work til 4PM, sleep til it was time for the kids to get up and I would get them off to school and monitor them through out the day; work out in the morning, nap until it was time to pick them up from school (choice schools, no bussing, which I would not have subjected my kids to the hell that was public bus transportation) Hello? Life is not easy and a good life is a struggle and worth it. Both of my kids are very successful and I dedicated my life during those years to making sure they could be successful. Raising kids is a full-time job even though folk out there want to make it less that that. Raising good kids is more important than anything else you can do. If you can figure out how to do it with hired help go for it. If you are lucky to have family members to help and keep your career, I commend you.
Yes, that was difficult, yet some parents and single parents have fewer options. It‚Äôs not only a matter of keeping a career, but survival.(edited)

Thank you for this crucial perspective.
This well written Forbes article about the she-cession will help clarify many  of the comments in this thread. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/16/the-she-cessions-hidden-opportunity
Let‚Äôs not perpetuate the inaccurate She-Cession. Secession implies a choice. If the wordplay is women‚Äôs (economic) recession, the term does not at all address the truth of why women...although I‚Äôll risk assuming every woman knows...whether single or not. Women are being devalued out of the workplace, wholesale. The October 2020 jobs report of more than 800,000 filing for unemployment was 100% WOMEN. (If you listen to public radio, The Marketplace program on PRI (Kai Rysdahl/sp) reported that stunning statistic. The New York Times, Inc. Mag, and many other media are reporting the choice of women to file for unemployment because they have to educate their children at home and have not been able to work simultaneously or have positions outside the home and no childcare...is that a she-cession? Hardly. We need a better term (also not exodus...explusion?) and honor 50% + of the workforce. With all due respect to the author of the Forbes article, how many women have access to capital, childcare, and all the infrastructure it takes to create a new business during COVID? Many are barely keeping it together. Sure, there can be opportunity in crisis, but let‚Äôs also be realistic about who can access the privilege of these possibilities when many are in survival mode.(edited)
Lane O. Facts! Thank you for explaining it in that way! I was only seeing the struggle of juggling all those things and felt we all do that but I see what you mean anf your absolutely  right.

This well written Forbes article about the she-cession will help clarify many  of the comments in this thread. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/16/the-she-cessions-hidden-opportunity
Let‚Äôs not perpetuate the inaccurate She-Cession. Secession implies a choice. If the wordplay is women‚Äôs (economic) recession, the term does not at all address the truth of why women...although I‚Äôll risk assuming every woman knows...whether single or not. Women are being devalued out of the workplace, wholesale. The October 2020 jobs report of more than 800,000 filing for unemployment was 100% WOMEN. (If you listen to public radio, The Marketplace program on PRI (Kai Rysdahl/sp) reported that stunning statistic. The New York Times, Inc. Mag, and many other media are reporting the choice of women to file for unemployment because they have to educate their children at home and have not been able to work simultaneously or have positions outside the home and no childcare...is that a she-cession? Hardly. We need a better term (also not exodus...explusion?) and honor 50% + of the workforce. With all due respect to the author of the Forbes article, how many women have access to capital, childcare, and all the infrastructure it takes to create a new business during COVID? Many are barely keeping it together. Sure, there can be opportunity in crisis, but let‚Äôs also be realistic about who can access the privilege of these possibilities when many are in survival mode.(edited)
Lane O. Facts! Thank you for explaining it in that way! I was only seeing the struggle of juggling all those things and felt we all do that but I see what you mean anf your absolutely  right.
I‚Äôm glad we were able to have a constructive discussion about it!

Exactly.  My neighbors in my old neighborhood (West Washington Park) formed an LLC to buy & refurbish my 1886 house so developers couldn't get to it. Now it's a historic property.
It was featured on 9News.
I will research what I can. I it's egregious to tear down a historic home to put a generic box duplex
This will happen much more frequently if the group living proposal is passed by our city council members so be sure to reach out to them if you don‚Äôt want to lose these historic homes.
While I understand that you'd prefer to keep the older home, as long as the new structure being built is within zoning guidelines, there is nothing you should do to stop it. Perhaps the current owner has all their savings tied up in the house and the developer is offering the most money. How would you feel if someone told you you weren't allowed to access the equity you've been building for years?
Good point.
I agree- since the zoning is in place, there is nothing that can be done. However, we can do something about the new group living zoning proposal which will allow this type of zoning in most of Denver.  It will also add many more correctional facilities, halfway homes, and homeless shelters to the neighborhoods.
This is false on so many levels. You should be able to make your point without trying to scare people (and for the record I'm not for the proposal).
The other commentators are correct. You'd have to purchase it.
I think the issue is really architectural approval. I hate the feel of the modern homes sporadically placed in our historic neighborhoods. Unfortunately, many buildings have been built on the former sites of the Denver squares in Congress Park over the years. The street in question already has several multi family buildings that my mom, who grew up here calls courts. So the density issue in this case is probably not an issue. Is there a method in place for more control over the architecture in these cases.
I'm not sure upon what date governmental interference and design crept in but on balance it does not appear, repeat appear, to have been for the better.
I agree. This happened to my hair stylist who purchased a home on south Pearl to run her salon. She changed some things on the inside, but left the outside and whoever bought the house next door put up a modern small condo building - my stylist was mad, but there was nothing she could do.
The process for saving a home is complicated and never in favor of preservation.  Anyone who wants to demolish a house has to apply for a CNHS (Certificate of Non-Historic Status).  As part of this process, the City should have a sign posted on the outside announcing the intent to demolish the structure and a timeline for anyone to respond if they want to try to prevent that.  You only have a few weeks to get at least 3 people to fill out an Application for Landmark Designation.  It's a complicated and in-depth application, often requiring research on the property, owners over the years, history, architect, etc.  The fee is $875.  Also part of this CNHS process, Landmark in Denver (part of Community Planning and Development) is required to look at it and determine if the structure has historic potential for designation.  It needs to meet at least 2 of 3 criteria (many other cities and localities require only 1 of 3) in history, architecture, and geography.  If they say yes, and accept your Application as properly filled out, the process goes before Landmark again, and then City Council, where each must say it deserves to be protected and designated.  Particularly at City Council, they are loathe to do what are called ""Hostile Designations"" (the owner doesn't want to preserve it) and haven't done any for several years is my understanding.  In other words, if the owner wants it demolished, the preservation plan dies at Council.
Is there an HOA in your neighborhood?  I‚Äôm assuming not. I live in Lowry, not in a historic house, but on historic land. We have a Lowry master HOA and my two previous properties were in complexes that had HOAs. Not always fun, but keeps the property nice.
I‚Äôve listened to several LUTI meetings and the councilmembers brought up HOAs and made the point that HOAs cannot restrict a zoning ordinance as it relates to federal and state protected classes to include the mentally ill. So your neighborhood is more protected than others but not completely. Again, I‚Äôm not trying to scare you, or anyone for that matter, I‚Äôm just trying to make people aware.

Denver City Counsel are all Developers. Hancock has not met a developer he didn‚Äôt like.  Lucky for us Hancock can‚Äôt run again.  I‚Äôm sorry this is happening! Many of our beautiful older neighborhoods have been destroyed by these rebuilds like Crestmore.  Several years ago Parkhill tried to pass Historic Parkhill provision, It was quite controversial.  But stopped for now this .  Vote and vote!(edited)
City Council is actually fairly anti-development these days, which can be seen in a few very recent rezoning decisions.  The CNHS process is also becoming less owner/developer friendly, as can be seen in several recent cases if you‚Äôve been following the news.  Whether you‚Äôre for or against these things, believe everything you read on NextDoor, like Kristen‚Äôs comment above.
I just asked the question as that could be a resource. I‚Äôm a lawyer and served on my HOA Board for ten years so I understand these issues. I also own three properties so I am very familiar with these issues.
This is one reason I love living in 7th Avenue Historic District, one less issue is a great thing right now.
Well, hopefully you do not have this same issue. It happens often.
If you‚Äôre against infill development and higher density, you‚Äôre in favor of sprawl. I‚Äôve lined in dense cities on the coasts and I‚Äôve lived in Houston and Phoenix. High-density beats sprawl any day.
Nathan, high-density Denver style could in fact create more sprawl.  Denver's version is to scrape entire blocks, often of old homes, and put up generic boxes.... boxes next to boxes, on top of boxes, repeat.  They then charge an average of 500K for these, creating more density but no affordability.  The generic ugliness of much of Denver's density serves developer interests primarily by allowing the cheapest construction costs-wise to maximize profits.  Nothing here is appealing in this version of density.  Density can be great, but it's not a panacea in every case.
Erik, You are correct that there‚Äôs law that prevents mandating affordable units. It all goes back to a √ßolorado Supreme Court decision called Telluride. There will be legislation introduced this upcoming session to attempt to override or chip away at the Telluride ruling to increase cities‚Äô options in mandating affordable housing. If you would like to be alerted to opportunities to learn about this legislation and to advocate for it, send me a private message and I‚Äôll keep you in the loop.
Just curious.  What can be built on a standard 50'x110' lot??  I noticed the other day that a small home I owned in Mayfair has been replaced by a 2 story duplex.
Erik Stark the CNHS process favors property rights and property owners.  If they denied every request the City would be on the Supreme Court docket monthly and spending taxpayer dollars to fight these cases. Property rights are a significant part of the constitution.  If you‚Äôve followed some of the recent rezoning requests you would probably at least admit City Council has been less pro-development than they used to be.  Anyway, no point arguing that, it‚Äôs a matter of opinion.  I do follow them and have seen a shift since the last CC elections.
The shift isn't about less or more pro-development.  That's part of my point.  The shift, and this has been worked on by the previous City Council, was to get more of a conversation going between owner/developers and the community for properties that were deemed worthy of such.  Whether they're worthy of that conversation or not may have some subjectivity involved but it's generally going to be properties that have some significant history or presence in the neighborhood that some folks think are worth fighting for.  This issue of property rights is obviously significant and drives the majority of the ultimate outcomes.  But I think the issue of developers demolishing old structures, including homes, then putting up cheap crap that they charge a high price for, begins calling into question the whole notion that property rights are the only thing that ever matters in how a city evolves and is able to keep some continuity and affordability in neighborhoods.  Denver has done a terrifically terrible job in this regard overall and communities are starting to push back.  The process can definitely be improved and having a conversation built-in to the demolition process is a good start.(edited)
Not a thing you can do. I am assuming that since its scheduled for demolition, it is already sold. What a shame!!!

Jennifer, what is the point of doing this! Just to be cruel and destructive? I‚Äôve never heard of this kind of thing. I‚Äôm so sorry.
It is usually to steal one‚Äôs gas. But on occasion, revenge.
Had that happen before, low blow theft. So, one could pay a high amount to replace the whole tank, or just use a 2 part JB Welt mixture to patch it.
I watched the video - never hurts to know something in advance of maybe needing to know later. But they showed the JB Weld a long time and then just flashed a short view of whatever solvent was in that bottle, never saw the label or figured out what it was. He spun the bottle around so I couldn‚Äôt read the label. Do you know what it was he used to prep the surface? Not much use to patch it if the patch doesn‚Äôt hold to the surface, aye?
I‚Äôm so so sorry this happened to you. I hope those jerks gets justice.
I remember in the 70's when gas was siphoned out of tanks but this is unheard of.  Crazy.  At least you still have your catalytic converter? Sorry that this happened to you.
Apparently gas stealing technology has advanced.   : (

I know of an elderly friend that this happened to last summer in the vicinity of 16th and Steele. A neighbor alerted her to a gas leak from her truck.  It turned out to be someone had drilled a hole in her gas tank.  She reported to the police.
Thanks, Frank. I will be reporting it to the police. I got confirmation from my car shop late yesterday & called insurance as my first priority.
Ryan, thanks for sharing that amazing video on how to fix this kind of problem. Amazing and kind of you!
One has to remember, our culture encourages overspending to replace things that can be repaired. 
Wow! WTF is wrong with people these days? So sorry to hear that this happened to you & so senseless & for what? Yes I‚Äôve used JB Weld to repair many things & it truly works if you prep the surfaces correctly. Far less expensive and it works.
Eric, thank you. I wish I had known this was a thing before I had it towed to my shop. I figured something was seriously wrong based on how my instrument panel was displaying.  : (

Jennifer Krajicek get something that has a huge speaker and put it underneath your car with the volume cranked to at least 11. If someone comes to drill a hole in your tank or swipe your catalytic converter, make the alarm go off at about a million decibels to at least break the thief's eardrums!!

Thank you.  I live On Holly St.

They should be able to plug the hole versus a new tank.
The shop said they won‚Äôt do a patch as it‚Äôs not safe/secure. And it‚Äôs now up on a lift inside the shop which is closed until Mon. I wish I had known anything about this whole scenario as I would‚Äôve known what to look for & pursued the patch fix instead. Hopefully someone else can benefit from the post/info.
Have you notice a very common thing among victims of theft? They all seem to not have cameras. Why wait until something happens, to get security cameras? All them fake vendors going door to door I bet you that's what they are actually watching. To see who doesn't have cameras. I'm just saying, all I know is that I know nothing.
Cameras are expensive and don't prevent crimes from happening. Lots of people post on here showing the person on camera who just robbed them, and even with someone on camera, the police aren't going to go stage a search looking for someone, so all that cameras do is allow you to see someone ripping you off.
I spoke to my mechanic bc I need to replace mine and yes 24-2500 is absolutely right..I choose not to replace it right now bc of all the steeling of the catalytic converters..he told me they get good money for them and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening!! 
$2500??? Screw that. Slap some JB weld on there for $10.
Sadly our culture has evolved from simple repairs as there is no profit margin.
Why would anyone do this? What is the point of drilling a hole in a gas tank? What are they trying to steal, gasoline?

I would sand the area around the hole with with grit sandpaper. Then I would mix the JB Weld and put some in the hole. Then put sand 1/4 brass screw with a flat head in the hole and push a little JB Weld under it. Then mop a area of about 2x2 around the hole and on top of the brass screw. Believe I'm a Master Plumber and have fixed Garbage Disposal's with small holes with JB Weld and it has worked when most Plumber's tell people
Brass screw, do we want to add a conductive point into the gas tank? 
","Thieves Drilled A Hole In My Gas Tank. Today I learned about & have been dealing with a hole drilled into my gas tank.  Apparently this is a thing although less common than stealing catalytic converters.  This is my first post & I don‚Äôt see how to attach a pic but will add that, if I figure it out.  The repair will cost ~$2500 bc it‚Äôs 10 hours labor as the backend has to be removed to replace the tank. Just got finished up with the insurance stuff & I will be filing a police report.

Very true. Scariest part we discovered they tampered with some of the kitchen windows. They were for sure trying to get inside. So scary!
I have asked the police to patrol and it appears that unless somebody gets hurt or personal property is damaged they won't do it. They will sit in parking lots at the Montessori School and catch up with each other in their cars but they won't drive around and be visible.
i tried to file a report 3 times today but to no avail!! They told me to do it online but I've been searching for where to do so!!I even went to our district station tonight and was told to file online. Not very helpful.. The person/persons moved large rocks from our gardens which i found under windows this am. I woke up sometime after 1 am when i heard a commotion at our kitchen window- very frightening but at the time i wasn't sure i heard anything'real'
Welcome to very real realization that cops don‚Äôt prevent crime, and that they only respond to it, thus, rendering them absolutely worthless when it comes to ‚Äúkeeping the community safe‚Äù.
thank you for keeping us informed.
Everyone keep your doors locked and valuables out of your car!
Sorry that happened. Just a reminder to folks that the DMV includes a copy of your registration *without* your address or other information, and that is the one to keep in your car. Worth checking that you only have that copy in the vehicle in case it is broken into.
I‚Äôm so sorry!!! Glad your ok and please reach if you need anything!
Terrible! I live right around the corner. Our house got hit around this time about 5 years ago. I will definitely be on the look out. The police had determined that who ever broke in had been casing the place. So, one thing to watch for are people sitting in unfamiliar cars during the day or night.
I've called many times about suspicious persons
Twice to me in the last month.  Car, opened back gate, opened garage door.   Incidentals in car stolen, like in your mom's case.  Lights on now, gate locked at all times,  but it's all so dismaying, isn't it?
hi susie-its ariannas mom/ yes, car break in not so bad but they tried my kitchen window- creepy- glad i turned all lights on !!
I would be more concerned with the police response. Lackadaisical attitudes like what you have pointed out is what makes crime flourish.
I believe one scam article said that if your registration papers are stolen you should put a freeze on your credit reports. These can be used to file for credit cards and loans.
You can condemn the police all you want but 2 years ago a vehicle with three people in it ran through my fence and took off running. The incident report on Sept 3 was i believe 640,000+ and i believe that is the number of incident reports filed in Denver alone. Two months later i filed another and i believe that was 720,000+. I was told by one of the officers it was due to ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù. With the pandemic, homeless and open borders this will likely increase.
who's condemning the police???
This is shocking, but not uncommon.  Many people leave that window unlocked for convenience.  My
That's terrible. Thank G-d they didn't come in & your mom wasn't hurt. I have friends on that block! Will tell them immediately.

Thank you so much for this post! I put out a bin and a bag at the bus stop on 8th and Harrison with some coats, blankets, and hats. Just in case anyone  sees someone in the area. Thank you for the good idea and neighborly spirit, Julie!
Great Idea!
I will start to do that.
I think the idea of providing some clothes is a  thoughtful one, and don't want to throw cold water on wonderful intentions, but I have had things stolen out of my alley-facing garage several times when the garage door was left open accidentally for only a minute.  The police told me that putting stuff out in the alley is not a good idea because it can result in crimes of opportunity (someone hanging out in an alley where people regularly leave stuff out and then seeing an open door.)  I wonder if there is a better place that we can leave clothes for the homeless during a cold snap.  The bus stop is probably a great place.
That makes a lot of sense thanks for calling that out!
Bus stops, any place where you regularly see tents or someone panhandling, and Civic Center are all good spots.  You can hang things in bags (so they don't get wet if they are found after the snow starts) on fence posts or set them inside a bus shelter or if it's small/light like socks, put it in a sandwich baggie and tape it to a lightpost or whatever is around in a frequented area. Be sure to put a note like ""free to a good home"" or something so people know they can take it without issue.  As someone else said, Humanity free store, and Denver Homeless Out Loud also take donations and hand them out to people.
I volunteer with feeding Denver's hungry and two members passed out 100 new coats and waterproof tarps on Sunday/Monday. Many homeless lose everything during the sweeps.
Is there a place we can donate to replenish supplies, Debra?(edited)
consider donating to the free clothing store called Humanity
Feeding Denver's Hungry has a donation box at Mile High Comics 4600 Jason Street for cold weather gear
I love the idea of leaving stuff out with a free sign. Thanks OP
And just a thought - if any of you are able, especially if you are involved with a community space who might be willing to host one, a Little Free Pantry (like little free libraries, but for food and toiletries) would be super awesome to have in the neighborhood. Maybe a church would be willing to put one up in their yard? I'm an apartment dweller so I don't have a yard and I don't belong to a church or I would have been trying to make one ages ago. These can help everyone, homeless or not, because a lot of us have struggled at one time or another to buy groceries or diapers or whatever, even when we were housed.
I love your heart! ‚ù§Ô∏è

We awoke around 4AM to a notification chime from ‚ÄúRing‚Äù that there was motion in our driveway. I checked the footage really quickly and saw a man entering our backyard. Once we figured out someone was back there we yelled at him from open windows upstairs. He emerged from the back corner of our yard where there is a shed and ran off pretty quickly.

We called the police and they said there have been lots of similar reports such as this in our neighborhood lately. Scary for sure. Be aware, stay safe.",man backyard awake notification chime ring motion driveway check footage quickly see man enter backyard figure yell open window upstairs emerge corner yard shed run pretty quickly call police say lot similar report neighborhood lately scary sure aware stay safe,"So Scary!  Thanks for sharing.
Saturday just after sunset when driving home I spotted a young man on Alameda & Dexter who appeared to be taking photos of the house on the corner. ( I told him he was in a bad location as someone had had a gun pulled on him 1 block away that morning.) without any acknowledgement, he pulled up his coat hood and walked away. I told the homeowner who called the police as she‚Äôd seen him earlier lingering around her neighbor‚Äôs house across the street.( The police responded but apparently they could not find him.)
So scary... glad you guys are safe. Thanks for sharing.
This is becoming more and more frequent in our neighborhood.  We as well had 2 strangers either enter our yard and come to the door asking about the vacant house adjacent to ours.  More vigilance on everyone‚Äôs part.  It is better to be overly cautious.  As I mentioned in an earlier post, we had a car stolen from the front of our house 2 weeks ago. It was found, crashed into a pot dispensary in Denver and whoever stole it attempted to burn it.  The bad guys are becoming more brazen and more frequent
Oh my gosh!! Allen, I‚Äôm so sorry to hear this! These people are getting a lot more brazen.
Glad you were able to chase him off. The problem with every Ring Thing that I see, is that you can never get a good video where the subjects can be identified.(edited)
Saw another man in someone's front yard leaning on a tree around 7am but wasn't able to tell if he was homeless or not, didn't see any items with him or anything. He seemed startled when I came out and saw him but he stayed there. Between 7th and 8th Ave on Clermont.
I noticed my backyard fence door was opened 2 nights ago which I thought was odd but dismissed it.  Now that I‚Äôm reading these posts it makes me think someone did enter.
I found a house key on my patio right outside my back door on Friday. The key does not work on any of the locks to my house and doesn't belong to anyone that lives here. Nobody else has been here since early September.
Someone bent our flagpole trying to get the US flag last night. It‚Äôs a wall mount post.
Are those bolt cutters?  What are we seeing in the photo?
I was thinking the same thing I couldn't make it out at all.
I think you‚Äôre seeing the clippers my husband used to trim our trees over the weekend
Really frightening. This communication helps everyone so thank you.  My fear is this will get worse while folks are experiencing so many different kinds of stress.   I am glad you are safe. Be well and stay safe.
More and more I'm being convinced that I need to take what little money that I have and get a camera for my front door.
We had two attempted break ins this week on our block in Congress Park. One was in broad daylight and they successfully got away with garage items. The other was a back door but they didn‚Äôt get in.
FWIW (and I know this isn't a quick fix nor cheap to replace a fence, just putting it out there where people are discussing such things for people to consider if maybe they are replacing their fence in the future), I was watching this video where it was former burglars gave advice about what they looked for regarding home security or if they thought a house made a good target.  One of the things they mentioned was that privacy fences entice them, because they can hide back there - whereas if you have an open picket fence or a chain link fence or something, where neighbors can see in, they are less likely to target your house because someone might notice them.  Just food for thought.  I know people like their private space, but with the rise in break ins, it's worth considering.(edited)

That‚Äôs horrible! I am so sorry
I'm very sorry to hear this about your car. I think as many deterrent's you can use would help. One get a steering will Club lock. Two after getting home raise your hood and take a couple of Spark Plug
Yes - the officer who did the police report said they will give you a club if you go to the station, so I am going to look into that.
Take the connection off of at least 2 Spark Plugs. They won't get far at all and most likely won't take the time to figure out what's wrong with the car.
This is disgusting how many cars stolen in our neighborhood.
agreed.  i remember a time when you didnt have to lock your doors, car or home.  when you could leave your bike unlocked outside the market, in the city center.
Im not old enough to know if this was ever the case in the US.  Probably not.  But my time in the Nordics this past decade was wild.  Just park your bike in downtown Oslo, no lock needed.  it was there when you got back.  The place I stayed in Denmark didn't even have deadbolts on the doors.
And it is said that things come in threes. So best buy a used Jaguar and you'll be relieved (terrible pun) when it's gone.
No cute comment. I was asked to post that we had two Hyundais taken from our apartment lot in the last few days.  The address is 1240 Elizabeth.  There is a keyed locking system that goes from the floor to the steering wheel and locks it.  Might be worth investing in.
I was told by the officer that they are targeting Hyundais/kias and sometimes subarus with a method where they use a factory key
Holy cow! The car theft in our lovely neighborhood is getting out of control. So sorry this happened to you.
Thefts of all nature will increase exponentially in parallel with shortage of jobs, lack of income, hunger and so on.
Well now, there's some irony...
Getting a car stolen is happening to more of us, but still relatively small number.  We will all get hit with higher insurance rates....
FYI:  over the last few weeks two cars have been stolen from our parking lot and several have been vandalized. On Steel Street between 16th & 17th Avenues.
So sorry to hear this happened to you not only once but twice.  Best of luck and best thing is that you are safe.

Update- Well after a day filled with lots of dead ends and a serious car emergency, I think the best way to help this family is raise some money for them. They really are in a dire situation. I typically don‚Äôt like to just give cash out, but if we can get their car repaired and help them into some stable housing, this will be a game changer for them.

Hello! I am helping a homeless family and am unsure of the best way to proceed. They have a 9 month baby and have been living out of their car. They moved here recently and have no address to transfer their benefits to, which has limited the vouchers they receive for motels. My husband and I have been helping them as much as possible, and plan to put them in a motel for a week, but does anyone know of other voucher program that can get them into temporary housing ASAP? We have called 211/311, Samaritan House, and VOA. Please message me if you have any other ideas.

Call  the Salvation Army they have emergency housing and help
I did! No luck yet.
Have you considered organizing a gofundme to collect funds for a deposit and first month rent? I‚Äôd donate to that.
Hey Mary. I think this might be the next best step. After a ton of dead ends today, I am very worried for their short-term future.
To this, If either of them work, I think that first month and a roof would definitely be a boost for them, and to help them save on housing costs maybe looking at a basement apartment would be helpful in saving the cost of housing, which is truly getting horrific in denver
So what do they need to reinstate or access their benefits?  Could they get a P.O. Box or a bank account?  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs overwhelming to be thinking about both immediate needs and trying to plan for the longer term.  There just have to be counselors out there!
I found a church today that lets people use their address, so that is a step in the right direction!
can you call catholic charities. They can help out with some funds for them possibly.
we could try to get them a po box,so that they could recieve their benefits. Also calling social services might be of some help.
Denver Rescue mission has a program called STAR for transitional housing.
They also have a program that help with 1st months rent & deposit but the home has to be in Denver

127,206,206,156084749,Rob & Stacy Parker,Congress Park,26 Jul,"City proposing rule change to allow number of unrelated adults per dwelling to increase from 2 adults to up to 10 adults. Hi neighbors! Denver Planning is currently proposing to change the limit on unrelated adults per ‚Äúhousehold‚Äù from 2 adults to at least 5 adults, regardless of dwelling size and up to 10 adults, depending on dwelling size (plus any related family members). This change is for all dwellings (houses and apartments) city wide. The draft rule change is available for a 30-day public review (it appears the draft rule was released July 17) followed by public hearings at the Denver Planning Board and City Council this fall.  The opportunity to provide comment on the draft rule change is described on the attached website.

https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/community-planning-and-development/zoning/text-amendments/Group_Living.html",city propose rule change allow number unrelated adult dwelling increase adult adult neighbor currently propose change limit unrelated adult household adult adult regardless dwelling size adult depend dwelling size related family member change dwelling house apartment city wide draft rule change available public review appear draft rule release follow public hearing fall opportunity provide comment draft rule change describe attach website,"Thanks for the info! Have already sent in my comments. Too bad this is not up for a vote. It will decided by the city council, if I understand correctly.
If you have opinions on this, comment now to the planning department via email: andrew.webb@denvergov.org and your city council representative. Remember that they are an elected body that‚Äôs up for re-election in Spring 2023.
I've emailed city council and all city employees everytime this is open for comment, I've called and spoken to my council person and sat in on every committee mtg. How many others are doing this as well?
Me
I just mailed my appreciation for the portion that allows roommates and such, but voiced my strong opposition to have businesses (receiving or collecting renumeration as well as having paid staff fits exactly that definition) sneaking into residential neighborhoods without approval.
For those of you just learning about this, there have been numerous posts / links on this matter on NextDoor.  I urge everyone to read and submit comments on the plan. The plan's driving proponent, Andrew Webb, has lived in Denver a whole 3 years yet he aims to completely change the complexion of an entire city.  Andrew is from New Mexico and rents (I believe) a place over by Wash Park.  He has no background/historical reference or connection to Denver whatsoever.  WHY CAN'T THIS BE ballot issue?  It is a travesty.
While I agree everyone should understand the issue and submit comments, I do not believe Andrew Webb‚Äôs background is an important element to this discussion.
Facts. 
Thanks Jill. To add on, the proposed rule change is now a sliding scale from 5-10 unrelated adults, based on dwelling size. (2,600 sq foot house for 10 unrelated adults.)
The primary thrust of this initiative is to disperse homeless shelters and community corrections throughout Denver neighborhoods.
Nancy, do you have a link to these documents? They‚Äôd be interesting to read.
THANK YOU NANCY!
Members of GLAC notice the ‚Äúyellow‚Äù members, notice the non-residents
Notice the homeless organizations, the community corrections members and please take the time to listen to the above Steffan Tubbs radio interview above!
I found this to be informative. It looks like all front range cities are 5 or less unrelated adults.
But no limit on children or related people.
All of you in your secure little bubbles of privilege make me embarrassed for the neighborhood. Let me guess, none of you are racist or classist, right? Have you been wondering to yourselves, ""just what is all that commotion about downtown? Why are they so angry?"" Or are you pleased with yourselves because you taped a ""Black Lives Matter"" sign in the window of your lovely 3,500sf refuge? WWJD btw?  Hopefully whoever you answer to is not as disgusted.
As does your reply Ray.
I have commented previously and feel that nothing has been done to address my and other residents concerns about the impacts on neighbors and neighborhoods of this proposal.  It seems like the drafts are not going to change their views, so I suggest also making your views known to city council if you are not happy with the current draft since they will be voting on it.
I feel like sixteen is an exaggeration.  I am actually a homeowner as well as a renter, not that this is your business. It sounds like you would prefer living in an even more exclusive neighborhood, one that has no apartment buildings at all. It's all in who one associates with I suppose. I know plenty of people who dream of having a property where they could welcome many others. It's a cultural thing I believe. And a class thing. The more some have, the greedier and more possessive they become.
Laura, we worked for what we have. Others need to do the same.
Laura Jones-McDowell - ""bubble of priviledge""  What the heck is that?  My husband and I bought our home in 2003.  A home NOBODY wanted that was on the market for over a year because it needed so much work.  17 years later we are still fixing/updating. We did as much of the work ourselves as we could because we could not afford to pay someone, all the while raising 2 kids and working FT.  I do not care if someone is black/white/brown/orange/striped/gay/straight/or from Pluto.  We have gay couples, gay/with kids, black, white, Hispanic, single, married, divorced, all on my block.  Our differences unite us in the commonality that we all chose this neighborhood and single family homes. If you want something work for it.  It didn't kill us to do it why should it be different for anyone else?
You were able to afford a house to begin with, so, yes, privilege.
Denver loves to be progressive until it comes to having to change the way you live even the slightest amount so that other people can have access to basic resources.
Ray Dude, you're embarrassing yourself. This isn't about luxury, and you know it. It's about making housing more accessible so that we have fewer unhoused people and more affordable rents. Denver is growing, and if you want to keep reaping the economic rewards of that growth (which you are, whether you consciously realize it or not), you can't keep pricing people out of living here.
Much easier to do this than create affordable housing. Ridiculous üò° leave it to govt to take the easy way out.
I agree with you. The city is making this  ill-conceived zoning change rather than doing something about affordable housing that will actually work. The other ineffectual thing they want to do is allow tiny houses in people‚Äôs yard with no restrictions on how close they can be to neighbors. It is in the east Central Plan. Most of those will end up as Air BnBs.
Tina Davis  , I do agree that they should close the loopholes in the zoning laws
Vicki Kelley We haven‚Äôt been exposed to a pandemic causing such an economic impact in the last 100 years.
Would you feel better with more homeless folks?
Ray Colaiano   Exactly, Ray!
","City proposing rule change to allow number of unrelated adults per dwelling to increase from 2 adults to up to 10 adults. Hi neighbors! Denver Planning is currently proposing to change the limit on unrelated adults per ‚Äúhousehold‚Äù from 2 adults to at least 5 adults, regardless of dwelling size and up to 10 adults, depending on dwelling size (plus any related family members). This change is for all dwellings (houses and apartments) city wide. The draft rule change is available for a 30-day public review (it appears the draft rule was released July 17) followed by public hearings at the Denver Planning Board and City Council this fall.  The opportunity to provide comment on the draft rule change is described on the attached website.

https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/community-planning-and-development/zoning/text-amendments/Group_Living.htmlThanks for the info! Have already sent in my comments. Too bad this is not up for a vote. It will decided by the city council, if I understand correctly.
If you have opinions on this, comment now to the planning department via email: andrew.webb@denvergov.org and your city council representative. Remember that they are an elected body that‚Äôs up for re-election in Spring 2023.
I've emailed city council and all city employees everytime this is open for comment, I've called and spoken to my council person and sat in on every committee mtg. How many others are doing this as well?
Me
I just mailed my appreciation for the portion that allows roommates and such, but voiced my strong opposition to have businesses (receiving or collecting renumeration as well as having paid staff fits exactly that definition) sneaking into residential neighborhoods without approval.
For those of you just learning about this, there have been numerous posts / links on this matter on NextDoor.  I urge everyone to read and submit comments on the plan. The plan's driving proponent, Andrew Webb, has lived in Denver a whole 3 years yet he aims to completely change the complexion of an entire city.  Andrew is from New Mexico and rents (I believe) a place over by Wash Park.  He has no background/historical reference or connection to Denver whatsoever.  WHY CAN'T THIS BE ballot issue?  It is a travesty.
While I agree everyone should understand the issue and submit comments, I do not believe Andrew Webb‚Äôs background is an important element to this discussion.
Facts. 
Thanks Jill. To add on, the proposed rule change is now a sliding scale from 5-10 unrelated adults, based on dwelling size. (2,600 sq foot house for 10 unrelated adults.)
The primary thrust of this initiative is to disperse homeless shelters and community corrections throughout Denver neighborhoods.
Nancy, do you have a link to these documents? They‚Äôd be interesting to read.
THANK YOU NANCY!
Members of GLAC notice the ‚Äúyellow‚Äù members, notice the non-residents
Notice the homeless organizations, the community corrections members and please take the time to listen to the above Steffan Tubbs radio interview above!
I found this to be informative. It looks like all front range cities are 5 or less unrelated adults.
But no limit on children or related people.
All of you in your secure little bubbles of privilege make me embarrassed for the neighborhood. Let me guess, none of you are racist or classist, right? Have you been wondering to yourselves, ""just what is all that commotion about downtown? Why are they so angry?"" Or are you pleased with yourselves because you taped a ""Black Lives Matter"" sign in the window of your lovely 3,500sf refuge? WWJD btw?  Hopefully whoever you answer to is not as disgusted.
As does your reply Ray.
I have commented previously and feel that nothing has been done to address my and other residents concerns about the impacts on neighbors and neighborhoods of this proposal.  It seems like the drafts are not going to change their views, so I suggest also making your views known to city council if you are not happy with the current draft since they will be voting on it.
I feel like sixteen is an exaggeration.  I am actually a homeowner as well as a renter, not that this is your business. It sounds like you would prefer living in an even more exclusive neighborhood, one that has no apartment buildings at all. It's all in who one associates with I suppose. I know plenty of people who dream of having a property where they could welcome many others. It's a cultural thing I believe. And a class thing. The more some have, the greedier and more possessive they become.
Laura, we worked for what we have. Others need to do the same.
Laura Jones-McDowell - ""bubble of priviledge""  What the heck is that?  My husband and I bought our home in 2003.  A home NOBODY wanted that was on the market for over a year because it needed so much work.  17 years later we are still fixing/updating. We did as much of the work ourselves as we could because we could not afford to pay someone, all the while raising 2 kids and working FT.  I do not care if someone is black/white/brown/orange/striped/gay/straight/or from Pluto.  We have gay couples, gay/with kids, black, white, Hispanic, single, married, divorced, all on my block.  Our differences unite us in the commonality that we all chose this neighborhood and single family homes. If you want something work for it.  It didn't kill us to do it why should it be different for anyone else?
You were able to afford a house to begin with, so, yes, privilege.
Denver loves to be progressive until it comes to having to change the way you live even the slightest amount so that other people can have access to basic resources.
Ray Dude, you're embarrassing yourself. This isn't about luxury, and you know it. It's about making housing more accessible so that we have fewer unhoused people and more affordable rents. Denver is growing, and if you want to keep reaping the economic rewards of that growth (which you are, whether you consciously realize it or not), you can't keep pricing people out of living here.
Much easier to do this than create affordable housing. Ridiculous üò° leave it to govt to take the easy way out.

I feel like I need to address a few things: Kathleen Lamb is not an ordinary homeless person. She has a home and a bed, and she has two beautiful girls that she loves. For the last ten years Kat has struggled with mental health issues. She had a severe breakdown this summer, and she has been in and out of psychosis. She was on a 72 hour hold and then was released to the Springs Rescue Mission, without the hospital ever speaking to me or to her case manager or to her therapist or doctor!!!. She did not want to come home. She said she had access to care. She had access to programs and she actually seemed to be thriving. We went down on Sunday to see her and to meet her boyfriend who is working and trying to get them into a better situation. In the last week and a half she began to decompensate. She still seemed okay the last time I spoke to her on duo. She can decompensate within hours, which we believe is what happened. We don‚Äôt know if she wandered off and was picked up or if she left with someone but she left her bag, her purse and her phone behind. She never leaves her phone. Not even in her worst condition. She also often carries her purse, even in this condition. The only thing missing is her wallet. And she has not used her cash card that I monitor since Monday. Our mental health system is so broken I have no words. They have made privacy laws so stringent that they put the responsibility of care with the person least capable of even caring for themselves. She does not have a street name. She is NOT your ordinary homeless person. She has friends and she has family who love her more than words can show.",miss thank help prayer regard cousin go miss noon message mom morning feel need address thing ordinary homeless person home bed beautiful girl love year struggle mental health issue severe breakdown summer psychosis hour hold release hospital speak case manager therapist doctor want come home say access care access program actually thrive go meet boyfriend work try well situation week half begin decompensate okay time speak duo decompensate hour believe happen know wander pick leave leave bag purse phone leave phone bad condition carry purse condition thing miss wallet cash card monitor mental health system broken word privacy law stringent responsibility care person capable care street ordinary homeless person friend family love word,"I hope she comes home safely and soon!

I think the Eisenhower chapel at Lowry had an Angel tree!
","Toy Donations. Does anyone know if it is too late to do an Adopt-a-Family type thing for the holidays and can recommend an organization to work through? If not, just a site to drop off new toys that will definitely go to those who may be struggling a bit this year?Children‚Äôs Hospital is doing their annual Snow Pile in the next week or so. Contact their Association of Volunteers to see how they are accepting donations and whatnot.
I think you can do it online through the Salvation Army and Walmart!
I saw that King Soopers is taking toys at the customer service desk
We are collecting new toys and other gifts (beauty/ makeup sets, anything else kids and teens would like) for students at Hill Middle School and their siblings. Some of them are very young and would LOVE toys. You can drop them on the porch at 140 Krameria Street. Thank you for considering!

He lives downtown and since he was unable to move it while he recovers I picked it up and parked in front of my house. Apparently someone reported is abandoned to the police instead of simply knocking on our door and asking us. I love my neighborhood but am so disappointed!! It was towed this morning and there was nothing I could do to stop them, what happened to knocking on someone‚Äôs door before calling the police?",car tow friend buy new car able plate contract live downtown unable recover pick park house apparently report abandon police instead simply knock door ask love neighborhood disappointed tow morning stop happen knock door call police,"That stinks! We had a car abandoned in front of our house and I went to my neighbors to see if it was theirs. I even posted the car on here.  I don‚Äôt have an answer as to why there was a lack of effort but agree this could have been handled better.
Thanks I get it no one likes cars just sitting around and we would of happily moved it into the driveway, just wish we knew. Thanks for being a good neighbor!!
Sorry to hear this. Hope the towing and ‚Äúrescue‚Äù fee weren‚Äôt onerous
It‚Äôs not in the system yet so we will see, I hope not either. I think when we show the medical records that he had COVID maybe they will wave some fees ü§û
Recently, I had two flat tires, with expired plates. I taped a note to my window with my phone number asking that it not get towed. A week later, I was able to afford to tow it to my garage. I felt lucky, I guess the note worked.(edited)
I will remember that from now on!! Good tip, thank you
How long did it sit there without moving?  The city might have just had it towed since there is a limit on how long a car can sit on a street without being moved.  Hope ur friend is better & so sorry this happened!
About 3 weeks, he had to get 2 negative tests before he could go out and about. He got his 2nd negative yesterday ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
This is amazing since there has been two cars on my block one has no plates & the other has expired plates that date from 2019 ? I have called about these cars & nothing has been done :(
Thanks all for letting me vent!! He got his car and total it was $220 with the tow and the ticket so not horrible but for someone that used all their sick bank after being out of work for almost 3 weeks he was pretty stressed out. Luckily he allowed me to split the bill with him so he didn‚Äôt have to bare all the cost. Like I side before I just wish someone knocked on my door or left a note that it bothered them and I would of happily put it in the driveway. Hopefully my friends and family don‚Äôt have to leave their cars with me anymore but now I know to leave a note on the window!!
You are a good friend.‚ù§

I'm glad to hear things worked out & hope they are feeling well ?
They are thank you!! He was pretty sick for a while but made through it all fine, thankfully!!
How do you know someone called and reported it and it wasn't just the city? There have been a lot of street sweepers, utility workers, tree trimmers working around the neighborhood.
The police officer told me it was reported
Definitely not good ‚ÄúCarma ‚Äú for your neighbor
There have been a couple of stories on Ch. 7 about predatory towing.  There is a limit to what tow companies can charge but several are apparently ignoring that and charging waaay too much.  Be careful and maybe contact Ch. 7 for help if you have issues.  They've gotten the Governor's office involved since the towing companies are blatantly breaking the law.  One victim even sued and won yet the towing company still won't return their car as per ordered by the court, saying they plan to appeal.  It's a racket.
the governor mentioned during his press conference last week that the city is not towing for expired plates (policy since april due to covid).  he asked that any predatory towing be reported.
That‚Äôs messed us that‚Äôs gonna make things worse in situations.
I've had 2 cars towed in last month. These guys are definitely on the hunt lately!! Mine was bc of license plate stickers. Tow truck companies DO NOT CARE!! ESPECIALLY DOWNTOWN!!! THATS HOW THEY PAD THEIR POCKETS!!! $350 each tow for me!
You need to report it.  Call the Governor's office first and they'll direct you.  They're not supposed to be towing for expired stickers and $350 is above the limit they're allowed to charge.
Last year a car was parked in front of our house for a month, when I finally reported it. Turned out it had been stolen and the owners didn't know where it was. So, after three weeks maybe someone called it in trying to do the right thing? Or a car without plates could have just been towed by the city without a call?
Sorry to hear that but was the car fully bought? Any payment?
Yeah it was bought and he makes payments on it, just bad timing around when he got sick and his temporary plates expiring
Good reason to get to know your neighbors, as if your scenario was the case here, if Jaime‚Äôs neighbors had simply asked it would have been easily explained and she could have taken action. Seems like the ‚Äúright thing to do‚Äù is to try to talk to your neighbors before you take an issue to the city.
I live in an apartment complex and the owners have a tow truck come through every night looking for that $$$. My car has been towed twice despite the parking permit being displayed on the front windshield. Their excuse was ""it was dark"" so they couldn't see it. I had to take an Uber all the way across town to get it. Not one ""sorry"" from anyone. When I woke up and my car was gone, I was shure it was stolen. BTW, this was a Deerwoods manged property so fair warning. P. S. All my tags and everything else were in order.
If that spot is part of your lease, they can't tow you.  You might have actionable options.
For sure. I'm sure they have an agreement where they get cash for every car towed, but as it's private property, I don't know what recourse I have.
If you pay for parking, you essentially own that space.  There may be conditions like your car description and plate number.  It would be the same as if they came into your apartment and took something.

Most likely wasn‚Äôt your neighbors, there is parking Inforcement now. They drive around looking for expired plates.
The officer told me is was reported, I live on a very quite street quite a ways away from anywhere the city would patrol
Leave it to the City/State to shut down the ability to renew or get plates and/or tags and then penalize for not doing so.  Amazing.  Not surprising.
The reason the neighborhood‚Äôs are now doing it is because the guy that puts out signs saying I buy kick car‚Äôs has been parking them all over and parting them out on the street. And another reason is that is the only way to locate abandoned stolen cars. If you don‚Äôt know the ordnance , contact code Inforcement and have them drop off a copy of the ordinances.

I live on 7th and Detroit and last night someone broke into our garage and stole stuff out of our car. He also broke into three other homes and/or garages on Detroit/Clayton off of the alley between 6th and 7th. One of our neighbors had a Ring that caught the perpetrator eating food out of their pantry and rifling through her purse. The police were able to get a good description of the guy (white, male, carrying neon backpack), but very frightening and just want to warn everyone to be on guard and lock your homes/gates etc as this was a bold scary act that effected several homes in a normally safe street.",break in 7th live 7th night break garage steal stuff car break home garage alley 6th 7th neighbor ring catch perpetrator eat food pantry rifle purse police able good description guy white male carry neon backpack frightening want warn guard lock home gate bold scary act effect home normally safe street,"Thank you for this info!
Very close to home for us, sorry to hear, we will keep an eye out and be in extra alert!
Stay safe. My husband has lived here 30 years and this is the first crime we have experienced on our property.
I believe my neighbor is planning on posting separately but there was also an intruder in our neighborhood last night, north of botanic gardens area. He cased several homes (Prints in the snow and footsteps heard) and broke into one with a dog door, was caught, yelled at and escaped back through the dog door.
John Rodriguez unfortunately you only have the right to shoot someone In Colorado  if you are in danger for
We had a prowler on detroit between 11th and 12th the night before . Footsteps in the back yard but they did  not break into house or garage
Maybe the same guy. They collected clothes he discarded in the alley (saw footage of him helping himself to a coat, boots too in neighbors home) so they are hoping for DNA samples of this person
This sort of thing is disturbing on many levels.
Right?! And grabbed a bottle of vodka on the way out.
We had someone break into our home a few (3?) years ago and they used our reusable grocery bags to pack up food from our fridge, freezer and pantry (he only took gf foods ü§£) as well as take winter clothing and a bike. He left it all in our yard when the police arrived and was caught 18 months later using DNA on a hat he left behind - he was already in jail for 7 other burglaries and they added to his sentence for our home.
Wow. These people are brazen. That‚Äôs pretty incredible that he packed up your food to-go.
I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you guys! We have had our cars broken into, an attempted garage break in and a tire stolen off of my husbands car just over the past few years üòû
Thanks Tracy! It‚Äôs sad that we have to go through this.
Audrey Williams it really is demoralizing.
we're just north of you on Detroit and about 3 years ago had someone break into our garage in the middle of the night - took everything that had any value. . . . including credit cards that they used at 2 stores (on security camera).  Unfortunately, the police were worthless - neighborhood/neighbor awareness is our best bet!
Oh, no, Audrey! I‚Äôm so sorry.
Yep! Sucks! This happened to three other homes on Clayton and Detroit, same alley!
Hi Audrey. Our cameras didn‚Äôt pick up anything and our alarm didn‚Äôt get tripped. I saw another post on ND with footage that seemed like the same guy. 
Thanks Lisa! I think Randall‚Äôs garage got tossed too, right across from you. Bob just mentioned that Randall reported it too. That brings the total to five homes. I believe two houses down from you where the construction is going on, they have security cameras all over, so there might be something there.
Also Lisa if you find that footage again tag me! I‚Äôd love to see it, as I was able to view the Ring footage from the neighbor and would be able to tell if it‚Äôs the same guy
This is a screenshot from the post I saw earlier today. I sent it to Margaret and she thinks it is the same guy.
Yikes. Seems like he‚Äôs been at it for days.
Audrey Williams yes that‚Äôs what I took away too. I‚Äôm relieved no one got hurt but really disturbed by how brazen and nervy he was.
Please tell your neighbor to upload a pic or video from the ring footage if possible
Great idea
Maybe if people start arming themselves and doing something, these type of things will stop happening. Learn about your rights. Make my day law!
Total nonsense, some innocent person will be the victim of this nonsense.

How do they gain entry to a garage if the door is down and locked?
As the old saying goes, ""Where there's a will, there's a way.""
Garage door openers.  Where is yours? Doggie doors too.
Are they breaking locks or doors? Lifting garage doors?

Snap. 7th and york. Garage break in. Guy obviously making his way down the alleys of 7th and 8th
My garage was broken into in June of last year, kicked in the door.  I knew I should've re-enforced it long before but after that I did 2 things,  added a 2"" X 6"" board on the inside and a security door.
That‚Äôs pretty genius!!  Great idea!!
","Break-ins on 7th and Detroit/Clayton. I live on 7th and Detroit and last night someone broke into our garage and stole stuff out of our car. He also broke into three other homes and/or garages on Detroit/Clayton off of the alley between 6th and 7th. One of our neighbors had a Ring that caught the perpetrator eating food out of their pantry and rifling through her purse. The police were able to get a good description of the guy (white, male, carrying neon backpack), but very frightening and just want to warn everyone to be on guard and lock your homes/gates etc as this was a bold scary act that effected several homes in a normally safe street.Thank you for this info!
Very close to home for us, sorry to hear, we will keep an eye out and be in extra alert!
Stay safe. My husband has lived here 30 years and this is the first crime we have experienced on our property.
I believe my neighbor is planning on posting separately but there was also an intruder in our neighborhood last night, north of botanic gardens area. He cased several homes (Prints in the snow and footsteps heard) and broke into one with a dog door, was caught, yelled at and escaped back through the dog door.

just splitting hairs there, seems to me
Ive seen several other restaurants construct ""outdoor"" patio areas that are essentially just extensions of the dining area, with thick, sealed plastic blocking all airflow.  The idea behind allowing patio dining was to provide a venue with airflow, not to create new, equally enclosed rooms.
Not sure...but it looks like Esters on Onieda is using that setup...they do have one section open to air however
Peoples‚Äô unmasked breath is trapped by an enclosed tent. Airflow must be through at least two open sides to cut the viral spread. Yes, watch that video.
The video was a real eye-opener, wasn't it? You  certainly don't want to sit down wind from people.(edited)
These restaurants know the rules which are there for our safety.  If they don't follow, they might get caught.
They broke the rules and created an enclosed space. The city didn‚Äôt just arbitrarily shut them down.
Absolutely not. This is public health
The city did the right thing. We‚Äôre in the midst of a serious pandemic that is killing people. A fully tented patio might as well be indoor space if airflow is impeded.
Maybe it‚Äôs me but I value human lives over business. As someone who lost her mom during the pandemic, my thoughts are that you can rebuild a business but you can‚Äôt replace people. Larah, I hope you are just as outraged by the number of people who lost their lives to covid.
Yes. And with the information that was put out above, I guess she wants everything opened up and the pandemic to spread. The economy cannot function until we get control of the virus. She named things but opening everything up was the only thing she endorsed. It was and is very short sighted. Maybe her info comes from Fox News or Qanon or dump‚Äôs folks. Who knows. It is a very narrow look at a serious issue. I loved your answer.
You are not singing to the choir
I too am unemployed due to the pandemic. I would not want a business to operate just so that people are employed at holiday time. BTW, the entire world does not celebrate xmas. Look at all the businesses that are open, and short staffed with hiring freezes. those employees are not happy to have to go to work and be exposed to a customer base who aren't practicing safe protocols.
If they're still alive, they're not ""Covid-19 casualties."" Let's get some perspective on what is really a threat - the virus.
If they are still alive and dealing with COVID-19, they will likely have health problems all their lives.  So what do we call them?
It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwithout warning‚Äù. If you violate public health orders, you get shutdown. They essentially created the indoors outside, so they shouldn‚Äôt be surprised that they got shut down (for all of one day). Common sense would have prevented this, but hey, at least they got some free press!
Thank you for providing the phone numbers. I‚Äôll call both and thank them for following the science and not caving to the politicalization of public health that is killing more than 3000 people per day.

Our garage at 535 Detroit street was broken into sometime in the last three days and my Specialized Sequoia was stolen. I don't know if they got anything else nor do I know how they got in, if anyone noticed anything please let us know. I noticed today on the way to the bike shop as the bike was not rideable... so I assume they stripped what they could off of it and ditched what was left somewhere close by. The bike is a road bike grey and black with a carbon fiber front fork a black saddle bag and down bars... it's relatively old but was my main form of transportation.

You can disconnect that emergency pull so something (bent coat hanger for ex) can't be fished in thru the top of the garage door to access it.. but you also have to be aware that if you do this and need to get out of the garage in an emergency (and there is no other way but thru the garage door) you need to be able to access that emergency area so the garage door will go up--- you've gotten rid of the pull -    I think there was a Utube tutorial on it or perhaps someone on NDCC can tell you how to do this.  A side note:  Why bother with all these new bike lanes....seems everyone's bike is being stolen - LOL ...   I am sorry your bike was stolen...that sucks.
They use the coat hanger from the alley through the top of the closed garage door opener to reach the red pull?
We also had a bike stolen from our garage on Saturday evening while our garage door was briefly open ... we are on s York
Such a shame, I'm sorry... The officer said that the homeless population uses bikes like currency. I can't be mad at them I mean, 'by the grace of God go I' you know? Who knows what I would be capable of if I were to find myself in their situation. He also told me to register my new bike with the police department when I do I'll post the link in this thread. I am sorry to hear your space was violated as well... Shame so many are so desperate.
My husband and I are going out of town for a few weeks. He owns an an ancient hybrid that in my opinion is not worth stealing but if you need a means of transportation, you‚Äôre welcome to it while we‚Äôre away. PM me for details
Another kind gesture, I was able to replace my bike today. I am very happy to see so many people willing to offer their own bikes to someone in need, definitely a bright side to all this. I sincerely appreciate the offer.
I really hate bike thiefs. Isn't that the modem day stealing someone's horse?
Exactly!!!
Our specialized was stolen too!
Hey I've got a decent bike you can use
Just pm me
Instead of speculating on what happened, it would be great to get some details from the OP on what happened to help the rest of us in the future.
More details please. How did they enter garage? People door or garage door was it automatic or locked???
It has a remote and a door that's inside the gate... I had a little lock on the inside of the gate, similar to a luggage lock. The outside of my garage appears to have been pried from the outside, the suggestion from the officer was to use slide brackets on the inside so it couldn't be opened even with the remote.
Thru the garage door, I bet.  If your man (people) door is secure and thieves can't get in thru a window or something (those bastards) can go thru the garage door from alley side.  Mine is just dropped  up and down by using the door opener (on my key fob) or the little pad that some have on the outside of the garage door.  You can punch in your code to have the garage door activated using that  pad.  So I think of the garage door as being ""locked"" when the garage door is down.  It sounds a lot more complicated than it really is... 
There is a Facebook group. ‚ÄúStolen bikes denver‚Äù or something like that.  It might help.  Hoping I might get my Bike back as well.
Oh man I'll check that out
This is a coordinated effort. Check encampments! They‚Äôre open air bike chop shops. We recovered ours that way but it was unpleasant and confrontational. Police can‚Äôt help.
this is probably the fourth or fifth post I have seen on ND about garages being broken into within the last 5 days.  It is very concerning.  we had one bike stolen from our garage several years ago so we keep ours locked to a metal rack inside the garage, but if someone is really determined, they could break that also.
We have a feature that allows us to lock our doors to any remote device and have removed the emergency openers.
We also had a bike stolen on Saturday. My husband ended up finding it on Monday over by East High School.
We may need to add garage doors to our alarm systems. This amount of crime is very discouraging for our neighborhood.  I think this is not random but a very organized group of criminals.
A garage door alarm is about as cheap as they come. For not much more. A device that tells you when, how, how long, and it‚Äôs current state. And if open. Shut it. Automatic or manual.
Hi. We actually live right across the street. The other night I could have sworn that I heard some noise in our alley. My partner and I both went outside to investigate and we did not see anything but now with your experience and what I heard we might be talking about the same night and incident. Please provide some more details on the actual day that you think that this happened.  I will ask our neighbor who has cameras facing Detroit, to see if any came up on her views of the street.
So I hadn't been in the garage since Saturday morning to get some stuff for yard work. I didn't notice anything wrong, it's just odd that it was the only thing gone... There were snowboards tools and some other fairly valuable items in it at the time and as far as I can tell the bike was the only thing missing.
Zip tie the emergency opener shut. Double zip tie. So sorry hope it turns up. What time (sorry if you mentioned)! They‚Äôd probably have had to ride by me
Tend to find (when I was a victim) all my stuff on OfferUp because of the anonymity
I've been keeping a watchful eye... The bearings weren't in the front tire hub so if they tried to ride away they were in for a rude awakening üòè

Another kind gesture, I was able to replace my bike today. I am very happy to see so many people willing to offer their own bikes to someone in need, definitely a bright side to all this. I sincerely appreciate the offer.
I really hate bike thiefs. Isn't that the modem day stealing someone's horse?
Exactly!!!
Our specialized was stolen too!
Hey I've got a decent bike you can use
Just pm me
Instead of speculating on what happened, it would be great to get some details from the OP on what happened to help the rest of us in the future.
More details please. How did they enter garage? People door or garage door was it automatic or locked???
It has a remote and a door that's inside the gate... I had a little lock on the inside of the gate, similar to a luggage lock. The outside of my garage appears to have been pried from the outside, the suggestion from the officer was to use slide brackets on the inside so it couldn't be opened even with the remote.
Thru the garage door, I bet.  If your man (people) door is secure and thieves can't get in thru a window or something (those bastards) can go thru the garage door from alley side.  Mine is just dropped  up and down by using the door opener (on my key fob) or the little pad that some have on the outside of the garage door.  You can punch in your code to have the garage door activated using that  pad.  So I think of the garage door as being ""locked"" when the garage door is down.  It sounds a lot more complicated than it really is... 
There is a Facebook group. ‚ÄúStolen bikes denver‚Äù or something like that.  It might help.  Hoping I might get my Bike back as well.
Oh man I'll check that out
This is a coordinated effort. Check encampments! They‚Äôre open air bike chop shops. We recovered ours that way but it was unpleasant and confrontational. Police can‚Äôt help.
this is probably the fourth or fifth post I have seen on ND about garages being broken into within the last 5 days.  It is very concerning.  we had one bike stolen from our garage several years ago so we keep ours locked to a metal rack inside the garage, but if someone is really determined, they could break that also.
We have a feature that allows us to lock our doors to any remote device and have removed the emergency openers.
We also had a bike stolen on Saturday. My husband ended up finding it on Monday over by East High School.
We may need to add garage doors to our alarm systems. This amount of crime is very discouraging for our neighborhood.  I think this is not random but a very organized group of criminals.
A garage door alarm is about as cheap as they come. For not much more. A device that tells you when, how, how long, and it‚Äôs current state. And if open. Shut it. Automatic or manual.
Hi. We actually live right across the street. The other night I could have sworn that I heard some noise in our alley. My partner and I both went outside to investigate and we did not see anything but now with your experience and what I heard we might be talking about the same night and incident. Please provide some more details on the actual day that you think that this happened.  I will ask our neighbor who has cameras facing Detroit, to see if any came up on her views of the street.
So I hadn't been in the garage since Saturday morning to get some stuff for yard work. I didn't notice anything wrong, it's just odd that it was the only thing gone... There were snowboards tools and some other fairly valuable items in it at the time and as far as I can tell the bike was the only thing missing.
Zip tie the emergency opener shut. Double zip tie. So sorry hope it turns up. What time (sorry if you mentioned)! They‚Äôd probably have had to ride by me
Tend to find (when I was a victim) all my stuff on OfferUp because of the anonymity
I've been keeping a watchful eye... The bearings weren't in the front tire hub so if they tried to ride away they were in for a rude awakening üòè

Don't let NIMBYs destroy Denver. Unless you're a first nations person or living in a tent, a developer put that roof over your head.

Judy, I believe your criticism is misguided. You may recall Councilwoman Sawyer's predecessor was ready to rubber-stamp a Walmart at 9th and Colorado before the neighborhood rebelled, as well as a very dense development at Alameda and Hudson that would have made parking a nightmare on the surrounding blocks.

I am a resident and I am asking for rezoning to legalize multifamily.
That is not what the Group Living Amendment is about.
Stephen Eppler multi family in the development world means high rise apartment buildings.  Definition of high rise can be interpreted different ways.  I see it as 5 stories and above.
Denver is putting the cart before the horse. Need to correct residential build rules need to stop allowing builds up to property lines, gutter and runoffs to downgradient property, removing too much permeable cover, low grade lead waterlines, no outdoor space for increased population, poor police protection for small crime like theft and loitering, requiring homeowners to pay for sidewalk upgrades etc. instead of making these corrections to ensure property owners that their land is secured we are being pushed to make another opened ended overreaching rule. Thoughtful change is not fast but can be more successful for all involved. 
Ahhhhh... do you understand we NEED rezoning? Sometimes it‚Äôs to PREVENT new tall buildings, no industrial ones AND the important inclusion of Tiny Home development. We can‚Äôt be all NIMBY and expect downtown to handle all the homelessness. POWER TO THE PEOPLE for fair housing. So... tell Amanda directly what you want. If you‚Äôre being selfish... just be selfish. Don‚Äôt pass the buck.
If this rezoning was about preventing tall buildings in our neighborhoods I'd be all in.  This zoning amendment isn't about that at all.  Why do you think developers and realtors are backing this?  They can't wait to get their projects in our neighborhoods.  Ive read the entire GL zoning amendment and there is nothing in there about preventing tall buildings.(edited)
I think all public officials in Colorado should be required to live in section 8 housing while taking a paycheck funded by the taxpayer, and that goes for Polis, Gardner, Hickenpooper - the whole lot of them.  They are, by definition, supposed to work for us, not 'the city', definitely not the developers and interest groups, but the citizens.  The people! My block will be affected by rezoning if it is allowed to happen.  If it gets rammed down our throats, it's me, not some politician living in a castle in Hilltop, but ME that it will affect.  So I take offense when some fella calls me the N word (NIMBY), when they themselves just recently moved literally into the back yard of a historic Park Hill mansion and built a $2.2M house there that looks inconsistent with everything else around it.  I find it absurd when some 'woke' person tells me that I am not empathetic because I don't want to allow a high density high-rise five doors down to be thrown up by a developer, especially when I bought something that I have poured my heart into improving for the last 11 years.  I knew exactly what I was buying, and now, without my consent, people that don't live on my block, politicians getting rich under the table, and newly arrived transplants jaded by the high cost of living - all get together and want to fundamentally change the face of my block.  You first.
This is what we are dealing with in the East Denver Plan. 500 neighbors at a meeting at Johnson and Wales and the city council members still don't listen!!! I hate these developers. It's all about the money. Park Hill was nationally known for their churches and members who stopped the ""white flight to the suburbs"" back in the 50's. We are truly a ""neighborhood"" where you actually know your neighbors and care and relate to them. I have lived here most of my life and I want to continue living here, but I feel like ""we are losing the war"".

I have had that happen before. It is shocking for sure. So sorry! Our world is ?????
Sounds like a basket case weirdo
After just going through this type of experience and having the final court sentencing about 3 weeks ago, I strongly encourage you to request an officer come to you and take a written report. Make sure you get a case number - with out a written report the incident doesn't exist. Even if you don't think you can identify the person fully there is a very strong likely hood that this person is victimizing others and the cases can be connected if there is a written report. Think about anything you saw - type of phone used to record, items you might have seen in the car, type or brands of clothes, marks on the vehicle, any small detail could be what links the person to the case or the cases together.
This is a great point. I will do that. Thank you and I'm sorry you had to go through that!
Good grief!  Thanks for the information.
Holly, I'm glad that you weren't approached or injured physically.  Thank you for mentioning on Next Door.
I also had an unwanted exposure in that parking lot. A man in a low goldish car pulled up next to me as I was loading my groceries and he was masterbating. Not pleasant.
It was definitely the same guy then. Sorry that happened to you. So violating. üò°
Kristen, if you have not already done so, please please consider doing a written police report.
I just reported this to the police
By all means I am not trying to be insensitive, I feel bad for you to experience that. 
Unfortunately Sandra, research has proven out that acts like this are a form of mental illness and trying to ""make fun of"" or ""shame"" the individual does not effectively change their behavior. Mental illness doesn't stop without intervention and treatment and indecent exposures are shown to be gateway activities to much more serious and often violent sexual crimes if no intervention is made.
Hi Holly, I am so sorry that this happened to you.  I own this UPS Store and I want to assure you we're taking this incident very seriously.  We've just ordered a new camera that we will use just for the parking lot and are in talks with the property management company about enhancing security measures.  Please don't hesitate to call if you would like us to come out to your car to help with packages.  720-287-0898.  Please call me if you would like to give any additional details.  The safety of our customers and employees are more important than anything else.
Thank you so much! I always have a great experience at your UPS store and felt that going into the store after the incident was the safest thing for me to do. I always feel welcomed and safe around your staff! I appreciate you commenting and letting me know about the camera and security. It makes me (and I‚Äôm sure many other women) feel much better.
Thank you so much taking this seriously and taking action!
This happened to me at the neighborhood walmart!! The man sounds the same but the car he was in was a newer white sedan.  Did you call police even after he drove away? You should if not. It could help build a case if it‚Äôs the same guy who is a serial sexual harasser.
I see now from the other comments that you made a report üëçüèº

Someone recently posted about a guy parking in front of the poster‚Äôs house and exposing himself. Anyone else remember that post? I cannot find it. I think the vehicle was described. Wondering if it was the same guy Holly encountered.
Barbara Sohnen I know the post you're referring to. That happened in University Park, while it certainly could be the same creep, I think predators like that usually stick to a specific area.
","Indecent exposure. I was followed into the UPS parking lot on Colfax and Kearney St. I sat in my car for a minute or two to grab my packages, put on my mask, etc. When I got out of the car to go into the UPS store, I glanced over at the car next to me and the man was exposing himself and taking a video of me. I rushed into the UPS store and told the guy working there that I needed to call the police but before I could do so, the car quickly sped away. Unfortunately the car didn‚Äôt have a front license plate so I couldn‚Äôt take a picture of it. 

Description of person involved ‚Äì Hair: brown ponytail, Top: White shirt, Age: 30s maybe?, Race: White, Sex: Male, had large gauges in his ears

Description of vehicle involved ‚Äì Color: Tan/gold, Type: Old sedan, License plate: No front license plate, back plate was a temporary plate exp march 21 Other details: Last seen speeding away from the UPS parking lotGross.  Sorry you had to endure that!
What the hell is wrong with people?
I'm so sorry you had to experience that. Just gross
I‚Äôm so sorry this happened
So weird and gross! I think that guy needs more to do in life.
EW. NO ONE WANTS TO SEE THAT. I'm so sorry that happened. Glad you're safe.
Very disturbing. Some people are sick!
So sorry hope the police catch this pervert
I have had that happen before. It is shocking for sure. So sorry! Our world is ?????
Sounds like a basket case weirdo
After just going through this type of experience and having the final court sentencing about 3 weeks ago, I strongly encourage you to request an officer come to you and take a written report. Make sure you get a case number - with out a written report the incident doesn't exist. Even if you don't think you can identify the person fully there is a very strong likely hood that this person is victimizing others and the cases can be connected if there is a written report. Think about anything you saw - type of phone used to record, items you might have seen in the car, type or brands of clothes, marks on the vehicle, any small detail could be what links the person to the case or the cases together.
This is a great point. I will do that. Thank you and I'm sorry you had to go through that!

I know a lot of you messaged me regarding Chris and Lilith, so I wanted to share an update with you. Chris‚Äôs dream is to own an RV or camper, so we have been steadily raising money to purchase him one. We are getting very close to making this dream a reality. I could use help from our community on 2 things:

1. Getting Chris a driver‚Äôs license. He needs someone to help him navigate the process at the DMV and if possible, allow him to use their car for the driving test. I know this a big ask, but it‚Äôs a huge obstacle we are trying to work through. 

2. Once I have located the RV, is there anyone that can take a once over of the vehicle? Admittedly, I know nothing about cars, so if anyone who is a mechanic who donate an hour or two, that would be awesome.

149,241,241,158387521,Jean Greenwood,Hilltop,17 Aug,"Oppose Amending Group Living Code. I am opposed to the zoning change to increase density in Denver neighborhoods. Instead of working with developers, city planners and lenders to build more affordable housing, some members of the City council have expressed support for the lazy option of just cramming more people into existing homes. This zoning change has the potential to ruin existing single-family neighborhoods. The amendment would increase the number of unrelated adults who can live together to eight or more. Individual family homes could be turned into boarding houses for week-to week and month-to-month renters. Properties could be turned into group living facilities for the homeless, community corrections (halfway houses) and special care. As the number of residents‚Äô increase, so does the number of cars, noise, overcrowding and safety problems.   
What is behind this zoning change? In a word, money. It has been reported that many of the Group Living Advisory Committee (GLAC) members have ties to for-profit group living businesses and organizations. These for-profit groups are not concerned about Denver neighborhoods. Instead their motivation is increasing the number of people landlords can legally charge rent to. Measures comparable to what GLAC is proposing has been passed in other cities. In those cities, single-family homes were purchased by investors who turned them into dormitory-like dwellings and group living facilities. And what was the result in these cities? Neighborhoods were ruined as renters moved in and homeowners moved out.
Members of the Denver council have a choice to make. Are you going to protect single-family neighborhoods or ruin them? Are you going to stand with Denver homeowners or investors? Do the right thing and vote to not amend the Group Living Code.

Good work, Anna!
Code is outdated.  Needs an upgrade to reality.  Be part of the solution.   Saying no is easy
Here is an easy way to help support the code change. 
Michael Schulman No thanks. I do not want to live next to a flop house with 30 people in 1600 ft. This plan has almost no planning and no regulation once the flop houses are occupied.
It appears most of the statements on here are fearmongering and do not contain actual facts.  You can see the actual proposal here: https://www.denvergov.org/content/dam/denvergov/Portals/646/documents/Zoning/text_amendments/Group_Living/GroupLiving_Proposal_Brief_Overview_Summer2020.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0vAlfcPZwbdfWm8cfdOYP4qEdpJCaANzX_yIW3DOzmUfBJxTFyPRM7L4o
No Michael, just the truth. Andrew Webb even admitted on a call last week that there would be no increase of enforcement for this overreaching overgrowth. Code enforcement can't keep up now. And yes, 30 people could live in 1600 sq ft because children are not regulated. 10 adults with 2 children each =30
Not fear mongering. Presently TWO unrelated persons interpreted to includes the entire family of both. Could be 10 or more ppl in one house.  Not sure how 10 unrelated will be interpreted.
It's so much easier to ask for forgiveness than request permission for this lovely city council that we have.üòî
Our District 5 CW Amanda Sawyer is opposed to the Group Housing Amendment. Please fill out the survey sent by her office to show your support, sign the petition in this thread, and attend/register to speak at the Planning Board meeting tomorrow.
This proposal is to increase the number of unrelated persons up to 10 living together in ALL residential situations not just group homes.
It is not just group living. ALL RESIDENTIAL situations will be allowed to have 10 unrelated persons (and possibly their families) living under one roof.
Which could result in 30 people and probably 8 cars.
There are a number of valid concerns raised here wrt the current proposal on group housing. However, I am not particularly thrilled with the apparent alternative -- letting developers build apartment buildings in existing primarily single residence neighborhoods. I don't think many developers have the integrity of the neighborhood in mind when they build. Much of the new construction I've seen is nothing I want to live near. In fairness to developers, I'm not sure how one builds affordable housing that works with our neighborhoods. I don't think it is good to not address affordable housing as our neighborhoods are already getting too expensive for many to live in which does not help in maintaining a city or serving its inhabitants. Probably not a perfect solution here but in my mind at least group housing brings less irreversible harm to a neighborhood than newly constructed apartments.
I respectfully disagree Simon bc the apartment house building form is not allowed in every zone district. The ‚Äúgroup home‚Äù amendment allows someone to take, for ex., a single unit and allows up to 10 unrelated (plus their spouses, children, and possibly other relatives) to live in whatever building form is there already or allowed to be built in ALL residential forms and zone districts.
Good point Meira. I hadn't thought about the zoning. I suppose then with current zoning (assuming no changes) the end result of adding density will be areas with apartments and areas with houses which may be fine but seems like it will mean living in a neighborhood with single family housing may be reserved for the wealthy which I don't think is a good societal outcome.
Don‚Äôt they also represent all of those other people that you don‚Äôt want anywhere near you?
Sonya, with all do respect, it is not clear that ppl don‚Äôt want certain ‚Äúothers‚Äù living near them.  If you take a 2000sf house and have 20 ppl living in it, at least 10 of which might be licensed drivers, where will the cars be parked? What about noise? What about sanitation? That is a lot more garbage being generated-and my understanding is there is no commensurate increase in the required number of bathrooms.  
Those that are likely less fortunate than you since you live in Congress Park and Montclair, etc. Why don‚Äôt we find some crappy desert that‚Äôs almost unlivable and tell them they can live there. Oh no, we already did that to some other people.
Sonya, I hear what you are saying . I just don‚Äôt see this as helping

Don‚Äôt understand your question
If this is yet another homeless camp with an abundance of theft and drug activity, then YES, I am troubled by this ‚Äúgathering spot‚Äù. The city is not addressing the problems of mental illnesses and drug abuse. Taking down homeless camps and allowing new ones to pop up is not acceptable and does not solve the underlying problems. I understand that I am opening up myself for a lot of criticism, but enabling and accepting the current situation is not safe, nor is it acceptable in my opinion. I have had encounters on my bike that threatened my safety. If people don‚Äôt realize how much we have enabled drug abuse, then I urge you to take the time to really see what is happening around you. The homeless problem is by and large NOT people living paycheck to paycheck and have encountered hardship. As a strong community, we come together to help these individuals and families, and they are usually open to accepting this help. A very large population of the tent communities are able-bodied people strung out on drugs. Look and really see. I am willing to commit to being a part of the solution if we can actually address the underlying problems vs enabling drug abuse with money, tents, etc.
No one should be living on the streets. The city needs to restructure its entire budget and force developers to partner with them in building low-income housing. 80 % of the homeless want permanent housing.  Let's ban together to get the city to do their job.
","Colfax Dog Store Front. Is anybody else troubled by the new 'gathering place' on Colfax, one block from Sprouts. I won't even go down that block.
Similar 'gathering spots"" have popped up downtown and their solution is Classical Music piped in at their front door. Don't ask me why is works but, it does.Nope!
Don‚Äôt understand your question
If this is yet another homeless camp with an abundance of theft and drug activity, then YES, I am troubled by this ‚Äúgathering spot‚Äù. The city is not addressing the problems of mental illnesses and drug abuse. Taking down homeless camps and allowing new ones to pop up is not acceptable and does not solve the underlying problems. I understand that I am opening up myself for a lot of criticism, but enabling and accepting the current situation is not safe, nor is it acceptable in my opinion.

My cousin, Kathleen Lamb, she goes by Kat, is now listed as an endangered missing person; and has been missing for almost 48 hours now. She‚Äôs 28 years old; and has been staying at a shelter in CO Springs w/her boyfriend, Josef. Thursday, 10/15, Kat was last seen leaving the shelter around noonish, w/ a man, now identified as a violent sexual offender named John Anthony Hargrove, a 51 year old black male, 5‚Äô9‚Äù, approximately 189lbs. Kat left her phone, wallet, and all of her belongings at the shelter w/her boyfriend‚Äôs stuff. Kat was last seen w/Hargrove walking from a bus stop to a trailhead entrance leading to Monument Valley Park. Hargrove returned to the shelter alone later that night; and denied knowing or seeing Kat ever. We are all beyond worried about her safety and well-being; and are praying she‚Äôs still alive and well, and will come back to us soon.

Thank you so much!
I‚Äôm praying!
Prayers.
Thoughts and prayers for Kathleen and her family! You did not mention anything about Josef, and his knowledge or possible role about her. Where is he?
Thanks for all your prayers and well wishes. 
Does Kat have any mountain/outdoor survival experience? Does anyone know what she was wearing when she left, given that the temps are suddenly seasonally low now? From what you wrote, it almost sounds like Hargrove might have known that Josef would was gone that day on his first day of work...Do you have any photos of Hargrove?
Sending prayers. This is horrible. Have they launched an investigation, do you have a detective on the case, and has John been brought in and held on suspicion, since so many people witnessed him with her?
Kat has schizophrenia, and checked herself out of an in patient treatment center cuz she didn‚Äôt want to take her meds. She‚Äôs not mentally stable right now, to say the least; and has no mountain experience.
Kat‚Äôs mom has been taking care of her 2 little girls; and insisted on her taking her medication and seeing her psychiatrist if she wanted to come home... for her daughters sakes. They‚Äôve seen their mom‚Äôs struggles while unmediated; and have been having a hard time. But that‚Äôs nothing compared to what they are going thru now.
Knowing Kat, she was probably just wearing jeans and a hoodie
I‚Äôm not sure what the police are doing. They did interview John; but nothing further has happened since he denied even knowing her. Many staff and residents saw her leave w/John; and they were last seen at the park entrance and trailhead to Monument Valley Park. 
Maybe someone knows someone who lives out there and they can have them repost?
If Hargrove is a violent sexual predator, why is he not in jail? I am so heartsick to hear this. Schizophrenia is a tragic disease and her disappearance is horrible. I am so sorry. I just hope she is safe very soon.
How terrible. Hopefully they find her.
Kirsten- I hope Kats mom is doing okay. It is always so difficult for a family when their family member has a serious mental illness and refuses to take their medications. I don‚Äôt know if your family has ever tried to obtain court-ordered medication for her but I know that the bar is very high to take away the persons right to refuse medication. It‚Äôs a terrible position for all to be in. I am so sorry that she has this additional vulnerability in such an already difficult situation. Is the inpatient psychiatric team involved in helping law enforcement think through what kinds of behaviors or symptoms Kat would be expected to exhibit if she was traumatized and un medicated. Is there an extensive search going on for her now in that area?
I have no idea why Hargrove isn‚Äôt in jail; possibly he served his term, or was part of the recent program releasing violent offenders, idk. 
And those who refuse to take their meds are sometimes their own worst enemies.üò¢ Hope this story ends better than it began.
I want to thank everyone for your kind words and prayers. I‚Äôm a newbie w/social media; since I rarely go on... I‚Äôm trying to find comments my notifications tell me are there; but am struggling a bit; so if I don‚Äôt see a comment I apologize. I truly appreciate and value all of your support!!! üíî

Thanks for sharing, this just reminded me to urge and contact my city council members to support this legislation that would greatly increase the affordability of Denver.
Wrong. Out of state commercial landlords will pack tenants in like sardines  without regard to neighbors or the health and safety of their tenants. They'll buy multiple properties, charge increased room or bed by bed rent and become slumlords in every neighborhood. This won't raise the quality of life for a few but instead bring the quality of life down for all. Have you been to NY, SF, LA recently? Do you want that at your front door?(edited)
From this feed, I think some of you may be new residents.  Welcome.  Some history: We citizens have approved MILLIONS for homeless during then Mayor Hickenlooper and now Mayor Hancock. Where is the money?  A few years ago the City Auditor said they did not know.  Also, our government greatly reduced funding to what I will call 1/2 way housing.  This proposal of so many unrelated adults (and unlimited children) is their way of putting a band aid on the problem they created.  No where have they planned for housing at entry level pricing or affordable re-hab.  Now they just want to make it for profit flop-houses in neighborhoods.  I agree with Nancy Bell about Community Corrections and Homeless Shelters, remove this from the number of people that may live in one dwelling.  Lisa Ramos, I believe your heart is in the right place when you say we need diverse and all kinds of people.  No one is arguing this.  But as I speak to my friends in CAP Hill, they are not happy with the recent rise in crime and shooting.  All kinds of people are good, but safety is needed for all of these kinds of people.  Finally, if you have children in your home, you will appreciate the child abuse and pedophile laws that are in place.
I agree that the City and State have done far too little to address homelessness and affordable housing in our communities. It's shameful and I work to hold all elected officials responsible. But - contrary to your assumptions - I have lived in Denver for 25 years and Cherry Creek North for 16 years, and I am a mother. None of those details change my mind about what is right - housing options are right, affordable housing is right, diverse communities are right, this elitist not-in-my-backyard BS is sad, shameful, and very wrong. I speak to my friends and neighbors who are hanging on in this city by a thread- homeowners and renters alike have trouble living in this city and we can change that with sensible group housing rules like those proposed after two years of study and community input.

The ""porch camper"" post reminded me of my father's family who grew up in a small town in Western Pennsylvania. Homelessness was also an issue back then and included so-called ""hobos"" who  rode the rails. Apparently, there was a fencepost on their property that was marked with a symbol designating their house as a place where a hobo could get something to eat in exchange for doing some work around the property. Things weren't as scary back then, and I'm told his mother was welcoming to these who came to the door looking for something to eat IF they were willing to do a little work... (Yes--I realize the world is a much different and dangerous place nowadays, and I'm not suggesting that people should offer food in exchange for work when it comes to homeless strangers.)
Not sure the world is any more dangerous.  We‚Äôre just more aware of the dangers.

You‚Äôre welcome.
Elections do count
Nancy,  Thank you for doing the work to keep this information in the forefront.  I'm very concerned about what is going on, and we're unable to vote or have a say in a situation that will have long lasting effects on our property and quality of life.  Thank you again..
I appreciate that.
This can and will forever change the face of the city and our neighborhoods and homes. I believe that I recently read Amanda Sawyer is now a ""nay"" vote, but she is just one voice. This decision should not be one made by City Council. Where do we go with this?
We need to contact our councilperson, we need to contact our homeowners association, we need to contact all neighborhood and citywide media. Most important is the homeowners association‚Äôs opposition in every district. Their main impetus is to disperse community corrections and homeless shelters throughout all Denver neighborhoods. They have let the leases on their community correction facilities expire and want to shift this expense to the neighborhoods. Please make those three phone calls.(edited)
Joyce Amanda did not say she was a ‚ÄòNay‚Äô.  She said ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt happening in ‚Äòher‚Äô neighborhood and she would vote for a revised version of this law.  What does a ‚Äòrevised‚Äô version mean? Oh and it‚Äôs okay üëå not to be in her neighborhood but ours when we are across the street? This shouldn‚Äôt be in anyone‚Äôs neighborhood.  All she did was ramble‚Äòpolitical speak‚Äô making you believe she was on your side but clearly she isn‚Äôt being completely honest about her vote.
This is an extremely serious situation.  None of the council members would welcome a sexual predator, violent criminal, murderer, or domestic abuser into an extra 200 feet of their homes but they are willing to put 15 of those people into a 3000 square foot home next to any of us.  Undoubtedly the council members vote their mind and not the feelings of their constituents.  Elections do matter.  Certainly recall is an option. Visit Civic Center Park and see what is happening to our city and no one is doing anything about it.  Garbage, trash, drugs, people urinating in public, and our leadership is silent, Hancock and the council.  Are Cranmer and Robinson the next parks to be ruined?
Allen Shaw the last time I checked murderers are not the ones residing in halfway houses....
According to the article in the Glendale Cherry Creek Chronicle, this initiative is being used in Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta and is having a harmful effect on these cities. Do we really have to follow Chicago,Seattle, and Atlanta?
Don't believe anything you read in that rag. I only read it to laugh out loud at the ridiculousness!
Denver has never made any attempt to enforce the > 2 unrelated people in a home provision. What would make us think they'd stay right on top of the new convoluted proposal if it were enacted. We know better. This provision exempts communities whose HOAs have limitations in place (think high end properties, gated communities, etc). It will not be a problem for them, so there is no interest or concern there. It is the middle class ""affordable homes"" that will be the target. Landlords and real estate companies have an opportunity to pack these homes and bring in great rent without any responsibility to exterior upkeep, lawn maintenance, etc. There is no provision to make a landlord or property owner help preserve a neighborhood. We are already seeing the result of rental unkempt properties in our neighborhoods. The present situation will only exacerbate. What's not to like about this great idea put forth in an unfair process?
With Congressman Ken Buck!!  This is just reactionary crap!!
Oh pls Ken Buck who?  I don‚Äôt have a clue why you you are going off about a person that has nothing to do with me and my neighborhood.  I care about my neighborhood and my home.   I‚Äôm pretty sure your Mr Ken is not on my home paperwork.  If he was I would certainly have him help with the upkeep, taxes and mortgage.  But unfortunately it‚Äôs just me and I care about my neighborhood and what happens here and pay for it too.
Denver is the only major city in Colorado and most of the rest of the US that has held onto the 2 unrelated people zoning.  Denver is getting more and more unaffordable and it is the hard-working people, like firemen, police, teachers, nurses, hairdressers and more than cannot afford to live in or near areas that they work.  People who have lived in neighborhoods all their lives are being displaced.  This is an affordability proposal and I support it.
As well as primarily being about Community Corrections and Homeless Shelters/Halfway Houses issue. And on the co-op side = 10 unrelated adults plus unlimited relatives to each.
Another concern with this proposal is allowing all of the changes as ""use by right"". This means, as a use, they are automatically allowed. Instead of issuing permits as needed, use by right has very little accountability. A permit can be revoked if the holder abuses the Code; use by right has no recourse.
A Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) request was made to Community Planning and Development (CPD) for contracts related to the Group Living Zoning Code Amendment. A request was also made to the City Clerk, custodian of contracts.
Hi all here is the link to voice your opinion regarding this amendment.  Your must fill out by this Monday August 10th.  Please send to all friends and family who are Denver residents have them fill it out too.  thanks.

I also know the goal of these halfway houses are to rehabilitate.  But the recidivsim rate in Denver for rehabilitation is only 50%.  I am not comfortable living next to violent criminals (including those that have convicted of rape, child molestation, violent assaults, home invasion, car jacking and more) not when the rate of rehabilitation is so low.

Thank you Nancy for passing this information to us.  Kinda of scary.
Very scary. I to have kept up with all the information.
Glad to see actionable steps being taken to help the unhoused in our community. I hope the city is able to follow through and execute this with the support it will need.
This will not be regulated if it passes. It is very poorly written and should be implemented by permit only.
Anna McCaffery you are not kidding it‚Äôs a joke but not for the people it will impact.
Nancy can you please post the link to these documents? They are difficult to read and we should all know where to access these public documents. Thanks.
We don‚Äôt have the links.  They were sent in an email.  If you want what Nancy private message your email to her.  I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd be happy to send via email.  Or you can also message me your email.
Our city government in action.  Instead of finding a solution to the problem, let's just slowly destroy all Denver neighborhoods by introducing the problem to each of our doorsteps thus bringing down the standard of living for the rest of us. They allowed this to happen at Morey Middle School and it'll now spread into your neighborhood with this initiative.  Rather than let us vote on such a controversial issue, the city council will just shove it down our throats.  No wonder so many people are considering leaving urban areas in our state and elsewhere.
What is further puzzling me is in essence they are encouraging landlords around the city to become slumlords by allowing them to pack as many bodies into a home without regard to the health and safety of those living there or the neighbors around them. If you've got a nightly rental on your street BEWARE! Why go to the trouble of renting it out each night when you can just cram 10-20 people in all the time and make just as much or more money? Nightly rentals are heavily regulated for the good of the neighborhood but these massive group homes won't be. This clearly isn't about helping those who can't find housing.  It's about attempting to sweep the problem under the rug and spreading the pain to the entirety of the city.
It is your time to send comment in before next planning meeting for rezoning and to attend the rezoning meeting on August 19. If you are concerned about how Denver Council is handling homeless and group living, please read thoroughly and act now!

Bottom line is : Remax Alliance' choice to sever a business relationship with Ms. Reich that spanned AT LEAST 30 years.speaks to an egregious break in the agency's Agent Code of Conduct . I am certain, that after AT Least 30 years, Remax Alliance extended every consideration to Ms Reich while deliberating their decision.(edited)
There‚Äôs not a lot of ‚Äòhigh‚Äô going on these days. I agreed with a lot of what was in Denice‚Äôs article about the homeless situation getting out of hand and Civic Center Park becoming an unsafe place. It‚Äôs too bad that the price of expressing outrage over an obvious problem is to get cancelled.
It‚Äôs too bad she thought she could go onto other people‚Äôs property and steal their signs. It‚Äôs too bad she equated the Black Lives Matter movement with the KKK. It‚Äôs too bad she tried to cancel other people‚Äôs 1st Amendment rights.
It‚Äôs not ok to steal and trespass; am I crazy? She was fired because those are not attributes of a realtor.  If we want to talk about her opinion piece in the Glendale Chronicle  I feel it is open to criticism because it is an opinion. Perhaps it would help ‚Äúsaid person‚Äù if she recognized her behavior was wrong- until then I suspect she will continue to be the subject of ridicule. Again I repeat... stealing and trespassing= bad!!
unfortunately  racism is endemic to the human condition just as stupidity is.    I know Denice and she is not  a racist in any way shape or form.   If she saw a KKK sign she would have removed it as well...be it good bad or indiferent.   BLM has nothing to do with black people..BLM was hijacked and it is now highly offensive to some people...even some blacks.  She has a good heart and i hope this doesn't ruin her life.(edited)
Paula, I‚Äôm not sure where you‚Äôre getting your information from. You are a white woman living in Hilltop and you propose that the BLM movement has been hijacked and you are equating it with the KKK? Please. First, people were saying they needed proof that D.R. did in fact commit a crime, now that she has admitted it, you are now trying to justify her reasons for doing so? That‚Äôs a really far stretch. Then you follow up with ‚Äúbe gentle and kind...life is hard‚Äù when you were anything but just a breath away.(edited)
If she isn‚Äôt racist is she mentally ill? As a person that knows her what do you think drove her to commit crimes, destroy her livelihood and cause harm to her neighbors and community? There has to be a reason she did all this.
We have to be gentle and kind to each other...life is hard.
Gentility and kindness would not only tolerate but encourage a civil rights movement towards equality.

If she isn‚Äôt racist is she mentally ill? As a person that knows her what do you think drove her to commit crimes, destroy her livelihood and cause harm to her neighbors and community? There has to be a reason she did all this.
We have to be gentle and kind to each other...life is hard.
Gentility and kindness would not only tolerate but encourage a civil rights movement towards equality.

Hello East Central Area Neighborhoods & Surrounding Areas,

The Suggestion was made to unofficially form volunteer groups of people to help clear areas beyond the sidewalk & ramps.  The streets in Denver are fairly crowned so crossing can be difficult when it partially melts & refreezes.

If you want to help organize in your neighborhood, either reply below, or email east.central.area.neighborhoods@gmail.com and I'll reply for you to keep the responses organized.

Focus will be on the Bus Routes first, and we'll work out from there.

(Prior Post) Denver weighs code changes allowing up to 5 unrelated people to live together, expanding halfway house sites
The Denver City Council is considering several code changes to help those in need of affordable housing and different types of residential care, though some feel strongly the issues should wait or be shot down entirely.

The first change would allow up to five unrelated people to live together in the same home, said Andrew Webb, senior city planner. And the second would expand the number of places where residential care facilities ‚Äî like nursing homes and community corrections facilities ‚Äî can be located.

Took off w/ the car w/ super $$$$ bike and lots of accessories (helmet, wetsuit etc). WTF!!

He is physically OK, a bit shell shocked. He is a very strong guy, but he was unable to overcome the 300 lb guy w/ the element of surprise (and his 2 hands on the outside door handle). Thank God there was no gun pulled!. The whole thing was caught on video and the 7-11 clerk saw the whole thing. Guy came out of nowhere, broad daylight.

Got the wrong emoji by accident.  The fact that it happened at 2:00 is really frightening.  How could you even protect yourself?
A couple of weeks ago a friend watched in horror as a large man beat up a smaller man until he was out cold and then continued to beat him.  This was at a 7-Eleven on Colfax.
Horrible to watch.  I have been thru this scenario.  Some ways to handle this that have worked in the past, otherwise, I would not be sharing this info.  Lock yourself in your car, if you have one, then call 911.  Have a clear drive off route for yourself as you start honking and flashing lights, day or night at the scene.  Sometimes, others will join you in their cars.  (This happened in our case) This may lead to the aggressor being distracted enough to stop hitting the victim and reassess his situation.  If the aggressor comes after you, obviously drive off.  These actions saved a man‚Äôs life.
Thank you for the information and glad he was not shot.
Makes you wonder if some 7-Eleven stores need to hire security?
We have an obligation to standby behind our police force and those who claim to defund the police force have one aim in mind
Defunding the police is not about not supporting officers.  It‚Äôs about transferring some of the responsibilities to agencies that are better able to assist and letting the police do their jobs.  This topic has nothing to do with the car jacking.
This is terrifying information. Thank you for posting- we too use that store. Will now be MUCH more aware of occupied cars in that lot- it happens a lot.
FYI there were no other cars in the lot. He was on foot, came from around the corner on Josephine.
Thank you for sharing.   At least your friend will be physically ok.  Had to have been terrifying.
Awful!  I'm sorry this happened to your friend.
Stop going to places where lowlife people frequent - 7-11, Walmart, Dollar Stores. I just read an article that Dollar Store has the highest rate of police calls for crimes inside and outside their stores. Crooks are everywhere now but staying away from places they hangout is a good idea.
My kid‚Äôs school is 2 blocks from this 7-11, we go there sometimes for a ‚Äútreat‚Äù after school (when there used to be school). Qualifying any establishment as a place ‚Äúlow life people frequent‚Äù is short sighted and limiting.

163,263,263,160572160,Sara Henry,Cherry Creek North,6 Sep,"Denver Group Living Change.org Petition. I received an email tonight setting forth details of various city council members' concerns about the rapid push to implement changes to the zoning code allowing up to 10 unrelated individuals and  an unlimited number of their relatives to live in the same home. I was heartened to see numerous council members push back and ask numerous pointed questions of the planning department.  Their concerns included: not enough time/input from the community especially during Covid, not enough analysis on whether this would actually hurt neighborhoods of color/low income, outside commercial interests pushing this to make more money, acknowledgment that literally there would be no cap on the number of people in one residence, 90% of public input thus far opposes the zoning change, exemptions will granted to about 25% of Denver areas forcing other areas to absorb more of the impact, etc. Bravo to the council members asking these critical questions before this kind of massive change is shoved down almost all of our throats without giving the voters/citizens of Denver the right to vote on such a life-impacting issue!!

The notifications I'm receiving with these updates from Change.org keeps asking for donations to further the fight against this zoning change. Does anyone know where the money goes that's donated? I never donate to a cause unless I know who's getting that money and how it'll be spent.

Unrelated people are allowed to live together now Scott. Just not 10 of them in a small house with an unlimited number of their relatives in addition to the 10.

Sara, great comment. This is a democratic move to change our cities and suburbs around the nation.This was an add on from the prior administration to the `1968 fair Housing act. /We must vote this down. I don't know where the money goes. You might check Act Blue.
I believe it's actually a socialistic move to change our cities. As for making donations through change.org, it appears your contribution most likely will not go to who you want it to go to. They often continue to take your $$$ each month. Many complaints online. If you evermore donations, please check them out st guidestar.org to make sure they are legit.
RIGHT now only 2 unrelated individuals can legally live together under one roof in Denver.
I agree.  A number below 5 is definitely more reasonable then 10. 10 is obscene and if the number was maybe double the current 2 allowed, more people would probably get on board with the change.  But outside forces are pushing the 10 limit because they'll be able to make the maximum amount of money from each property.  If our government approves 10, they've sold their citizens and their souls  out.
https://www.westword.com/news/denver-group-living-zoning-code-proposal-could-get-update-11788147
How is ""home"" defined? If it passes will a 250 square foot studio allow up to 10 people and unlimited family members?!!
That's a great question
I'm just envisioning dressers with a baby in each drawer now ! 
Areas with HOAs that regulate number of residents are exempt plus some other specially zoned areas (can't remember what the zoning area is called).  Those exemptions total about 25% of Denver neighborhoods.  City council members pointed out that this would be unfair and cause even more of an impact on other less well to do areas.
I can see some of the pros and cons after 20 mins of preliminary thought. 1) Housing costs are at an all time high in Denver along with 3% vacancy rate of rentals (pre-covid), therefore, one might posit that we need more ability to house people more affordably.  2) I understand some cultures have a nuclear family model, but in many cultures the extended family reside in the same locale if not the same ""home?"" 3) Will landlords/managers be able to screen each resident or be limited by cost of running everyone's background check and will landlords require a fee to screen each resident, who keeps track of such, and won't this incur additional costs for those who are already 'marginally' housed? PS. Marissa Star You should see 'capsule hotels' in Japan, in a densely populated metropolis.
I've seen them :) I've also seen unfinished basements with families living in them. I also see alot of homeless here in Denver and wonder how much the rental capacity would impact that , perhaps less on the streets ? YOU are right , that's alot of background checks! Say one had no siblings , they are forced into a one roomate situation,  that is not right. 
Jerimiah Stone these are the current SF requirements .
On several threads now I am seeing posts that chastise those opposed to the Denver Group Living proposal, citing NIMBY, elitist Hilltop residents, etc. This from Channel 7 would indicate that opposition doesn't just come from Hilltop and other upscale neighborhoods. https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/360/backlash-grows-over-denvers-group-living-proposal-allowing-10-unrelated-adults-to-live-in-one-house?fbclid=IwAR1kmyPQNU3EIQ9c4REePnXRkk2oEbH9FK0unhVWRwk4MTK31Qxsun94mJA
Laura, renters who want to rent a house, rather than a bunk bed, will not like this at all, after they see what it brings.
The amount of disdain here for young people, low income people, and marginalized people who can't afford housing in our increasingly expensive city is incredibly disheartening. 
Unfortunately, the proposed change will not work as you have stated.

Sara, great comment. This is a democratic move to change our cities and suburbs around the nation.This was an add on from the prior administration to the `1968 fair Housing act. /We must vote this down. I don't know where the money goes. You might check Act Blue.
I believe it's actually a socialistic move to change our cities. As for making donations through change.org, it appears your contribution most likely will not go to who you want it to go to. They often continue to take your $$$ each month. Many complaints online. If you evermore donations, please check them out st guidestar.org to make sure they are legit.
RIGHT now only 2 unrelated individuals can legally live together under one roof in Denver.
I agree.  A number below 5 is definitely more reasonable then 10. 10 is obscene and if the number was maybe double the current 2 allowed, more people would probably get on board with the change.  But outside forces are pushing the 10 limit because they'll be able to make the maximum amount of money from each property.  If our government approves 10, they've sold their citizens and their souls  out.

How is ""home"" defined? If it passes will a 250 square foot studio allow up to 10 people and unlimited family members?!!
That's a great question
I'm just envisioning dressers with a baby in each drawer now ! 
Areas with HOAs that regulate number of residents are exempt plus some other specially zoned areas (can't remember what the zoning area is called).  Those exemptions total about 25% of Denver neighborhoods.  City council members pointed out that this would be unfair and cause even more of an impact on other less well to do areas.
I can see some of the pros and cons after 20 mins of preliminary thought. 1) Housing costs are at an all time high in Denver along with 3% vacancy rate of rentals (pre-covid), therefore, one might posit that we need more ability to house people more affordably.  2) I understand some cultures have a nuclear family model, but in many cultures the extended family reside in the same locale if not the same ""home?"" 3) Will landlords/managers be able to screen each resident or be limited by cost of running everyone's background check and will landlords require a fee to screen each resident, who keeps track of such, and won't this incur additional costs for those who are already 'marginally' housed? PS. Marissa Star You should see 'capsule hotels' in Japan, in a densely populated metropolis.
I've seen them :) I've also seen unfinished basements with families living in them. I also see alot of homeless here in Denver and wonder how much the rental capacity would impact that , perhaps less on the streets ? YOU are right , that's alot of background checks! Say one had no siblings , they are forced into a one roomate situation,  that is not right. 
Jerimiah Stone these are the current SF requirements .
On several threads now I am seeing posts that chastise those opposed to the Denver Group Living proposal, citing NIMBY, elitist Hilltop residents, etc. This from Channel 7 would indicate that opposition doesn't just come from Hilltop and other upscale neighborhoods. https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/360/backlash-grows-over-denvers-group-living-proposal-allowing-10-unrelated-adults-to-live-in-one-house?fbclid=IwAR1kmyPQNU3EIQ9c4REePnXRkk2oEbH9FK0unhVWRwk4MTK31Qxsun94mJA
Laura, renters who want to rent a house, rather than a bunk bed, will not like this at all, after they see what it brings.
The amount of disdain here for young people, low income people, and marginalized people who can't afford housing in our increasingly expensive city is incredibly disheartening. 
Unfortunately, the proposed change will not work as you have stated.

If someone has the opportunity to address the group, could we please ask (Mr. Webb, if he's present) to confirm or deny that neighborhoods with HOA rules about residency are exempt from the Group Living Amendment, and their HOA rules take precedence? I think we need to hear him confirm one way or the other and it should be specified in the proposal. It would protect several neighborhoods and make others even more vulnerable.

167,268,268,158127610,Nancy Bell,Hilltop,14 Aug,"I wanted to share this letter. Councilman Kashmann: 

For forty-seven years I have made my home in Denver after returning from service in Vietnam. I was attracted to living in Denver because it had a renowned reputation for excellent neighborhood communities and spirit.  I chose Congress Park as the neighborhood in which to live and raise my family, opting to send all three of our children to Denver Public Schools. I volunteered for years on the soccer fields, in the schools, in neighborhood organizations  and in my downtown place of worship.  While we as a family, and I as a practicing lawyer for over forty-four years, assisted those who struggled in our community to meet basic human needs, we felt safe and took pride in neighborhood activities.  I moved to University Park fifteen years ago, when I needed to find a wheelchair accessible home for my daughter (a housing need not addressed or met by Denver's leadership) ; I have continued neighborhood participation and have run for office twice for the University Park area.  

I am therefore appalled and outraged by Denver City Council's apparent effort to disregard the efforts of homeowners and citizens to improve their neighborhoods and develop neighborhood spirit and cohesiveness - open to persons of all racial, ethnic, sexual preferences and social backgrounds, etc  - by undermining the desire of all homeowners to live and raise families in safe, open and livable space, by destroying reasonable density and property use zoning with Group Living mandates.  I was raised in the city of Philadelphia, have lived in a number of high density cities on the East and West Coast, and chose to move to Denver to put those less than desirable experiences behind me.  There is no reason or justification to implant Group Homes with more than three unrelated persons - and their relatives - or Community Corrections half way housing or drug rehab facilities in neighborhoods where young children, play, ride their bikes and walk to school.  As a defense attorney, I have first hand knowledge of the unsafe conditions that attend half way houses and drug rehab centers. No Denver resident should be unaware of the issues posed by current un-monitored ""camp sites"" in family centered neighborhoods, with attendant drug use, crime and health issues.  At the same time, certain City Council politicians seek to defund the police and offer us the chaos and vandalism of downtown Denver; shame on them !   

The Group Home approach reflects a lazy, non creative, and foolish approach to issues that demand intellect and commonsense - spread the problem and pander to certain ideologues and constituents, while doing nothing to address the mental illness, drug abuse, and hopelessness of those on the streets, or cramming more people into homes and neighborhoods where the infrastructure is lacking and the likelihood of those people becoming part of the community is next to nil.  Denver is large enough to implement creative housing options and ""campsites"" that offer basic services and security, without trashing existing neighborhoods. Do citizens really want the unsafe and unhealthy circumstances of Civic Center Park and the downtown Denver Library to be superimposed on our safe neighborhoods? A resounding NO is the answer. 

Councilman Kashmann - represent your constituents and stop cowering to the radicals on City Council that are spearheading this destructive effort, that will lead to families leaving the City for safer neighborhoods. I will look for your leadership in the days ahead.

Bigger question, why are they homeless? Because they are victims of a corrupt system that takes everything and leaves no empathy in its wake of destruction as you are lied to with the kind words "" we are the government, we are here to help you"". Only to find out that all your hard earned money and tax dollars spent foolishly on other things, instead for those in need were loaned to those in need and every time they get a leg up, someone takes it all away with the swipe of a pen to recover funds that were never meant to be paid back. Why are we trusting information that is not close to being Government affiliate supplied or even based on educated repeatable scientifically documented practices. Lockdowns that are created by the expertise of people who know nothing about synthesizing cultures for virus growth, as we scream ""mask"" from the tallest apartments at 8 PM as world software providers can't design a program to avoid your electronics from getting sick, and yet they dictate how you should interact in your pursuit of happiness with social interaction along with, what and when you can have your God and the given right's restored while the economy is destroyed, our lives are ruined, and our kids futures are in debt justified by an invisible enemy all so you can have a better life for you and your children as you move from middle class to homeless as you lose faith in the very thing you worked so hard for.
Where DO we put halfway houses, group homes, campsites, etc?  Globeville?  Five Points?
If I remember correctly, information sent by my council person Amanda Sawyer said they are allowed in industrial zones. Zoning decisions have traditionally been made at the local level.
Thank you for taking the time to put your very carefully considered thoughts into writing.  Bravo...
Dear Mr Linton- thank you for a brilliant, compassionate critique of the proposed density change in R-1 neighborhoods. And thank you, Nancy, for sharing it. Excellently articulated!
Julie Jacobs
The group housing proposal under consideration in Denver appears to be in keeping with the spirit of the Obama-era Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule. The rule provides incentives that in effect impose on local zoning decisions made at the national level. Trump, with full support from HUD Secretary Ben Carson, rolled back the rule. I would guess that it will be back in full force with a Biden presidency.
Ben Carson‚Äôs support was probably along the lines of, ‚ÄúHuh? Wha?‚Äù
Voters need to be informed before casting their vote. Remember, elections have consequences!
Agree with Mr. Linton‚Äôs response.  Very, very well stated.
Several years ago I had a rental property in a tract home development in Henderson, between Denver and Brighton.  This community was a covenant controlled housing development with defined regulations regarding many things including parking restrictions.  I hired a property management company who provided a lease that complied with the neighborhood HOA regulations.  Although the tenants signed the lease indicating the occupants would be a husband & wife with two small children and no pets, they failed to comply with that stipulation.  
I know Paul, and he is one of the most thoughtful people I know. I completely endorse his letter.
Also, it looks like YIMBY are proud they found a way to rig Councilwoman Sawyer‚Äôs poll, ‚Äúyou can fill out as many times as you want in incognito mode.‚Äù
I don't think the person who make that comment lives Sawyer's district and I doubt that he is a YIMBY member. I think he was just making an observation.
Buffy Gilfoil you can read the whole conversation on YIMBY Facebook page.  He was trying to eliminate the preview and open the link to everyone, not just her district which is how it is set up and then he keeps working on it to enable voting as many times as you want. What tech companies do these people work for??
Mrs  Bell
Hi Pauline, Thank you. I‚Äôm usually very quiet. In fact, the people who know me, can‚Äôt believe this is me talking. But, I‚Äôm tired of being quiet and watching our city get destroyed. The muzzle has come off!
Well said.  Thank you.
Our City Counsel Representative Amanda Sawyer put out a questionnaire to get input from the neighborhoods she represents regarding the Group Home proposal.  I am hopeful every City Council member is doing the same. Make your voices heard if you oppose this proposal. This is what democracy looks like.
Except YIMBY has rigged the poll so that they seem to be able to answer numerous times
See above, really??
As a native of Denver, I‚Äôm seriously disheartened by the lack of empathy. This proposal does not just include criminals. We have destroyed so many low income neighborhoods and pushed people out of the only affordable housing in this city. We can‚Äôt do that and then have a problem with these kind of proposals. We take over your backyard but then cry not in my backyard. What do you expect? Then people complain about the homeless problem. If you are that concerned, help fix it instead of just playing Monday morning quarterback. Be part of the solution, address the underlying issues and find compassionate.
Good point. That goes to mayor and zoning and planning departments that let it happen.
Thank you Sir for your message  I concur with you and pray the mayor , representatives, governor will heed to assisting these individuals  with pragmatic living areas to rebuild their lives!!! Let us set up mental health wellness , parameters for job opportunities, accountability/responsibilities the individuals will adhere to and consequences if not met. I do support the rebuilding and building of lives, so all know they have a purpose and contribution to our city , county , state and America. We must let them know they are worthy !!
It‚Äôs so interesting to see the neighborhoods these comments are coming from. You want some white milk to wash down all that white bread? What are you all so afraid of? Thank goodness for diversity and people who care about others who may not look like them. Pretty soon you will all be a minority and won‚Äôt that be interesting to watch. Maybe that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre so afraid of.üßê
^^^ This.  Way to go fellow Mayfairian!  Mayfairite?
Bravo to you!
Thank you, Paul. It takes courage to have an opinion that was not formed in a mob. I presume that you have worked with and defended many people of every color, and I saw no reference to race in your concern. Even so, the attack came. I too, have spent decades working and giving to many people in many nations and almost all in poverty. I love these people, as I love the people in both Denver jails, that I have visited, counseled, taught and prayed with for the last decade.
We are in a national crisis.  Why blame the problem on the most destitute victims of the crisis?  Why can't we find s as nctioned campsites for these victims that includes minimal sanitation and safety facilities to protect them and us?  The adhoc camping facilities should be called Trumpvilles because we have a President who golf's while the citizens suffer.
Yes, just as they did with Hoover during the Great Depression

Only to find out that all your hard earned money and tax dollars spent foolishly on other things, instead for those in need were loaned to those in need and every time they get a leg up, someone takes it all away with the swipe of a pen to recover funds that were never meant to be paid back. Why are we trusting information that is not close to being Government affiliate supplied or even based on educated repeatable scientifically documented practices. Lockdowns that are created by the expertise of people who know nothing about synthesizing cultures for virus growth, as we scream ""mask"" from the tallest apartments at 8 PM as world software providers can't design a program to avoid your electronics from getting sick, and yet they dictate how you should interact in your pursuit of happiness with social interaction along with, what and when you can have your God and the given right's restored while the economy is destroyed, our lives are ruined, and our kids futures are in debt justified by an invisible enemy all so you can have a better life for you and your children as you move from middle class to homeless as you lose faith in the very thing you worked so hard for.
Where DO we put halfway houses, group homes, campsites, etc?  Globeville?  Five Points?
If I remember correctly, information sent by my council person Amanda Sawyer said they are allowed in industrial zones. Zoning decisions have traditionally been made at the local level.
Thank you for taking the time to put your very carefully considered thoughts into writing.  Bravo...
Dear Mr Linton- thank you for a brilliant, compassionate critique of the proposed density change in R-1 neighborhoods. And thank you, Nancy, for sharing it. Excellently articulated!
Julie Jacobs
The group housing proposal under consideration in Denver appears to be in keeping with the spirit of the Obama-era Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule. The rule provides incentives that in effect impose on local zoning decisions made at the national level. Trump, with full support from HUD Secretary Ben Carson, rolled back the rule. I would guess that it will be back in full force with a Biden presidency.
Ben Carson‚Äôs support was probably along the lines of, ‚ÄúHuh? Wha?‚Äù
Voters need to be informed before casting their vote. Remember, elections have consequences!
Agree with Mr. Linton‚Äôs response.  Very, very well stated.
Several years ago I had a rental property in a tract home development in Henderson, between Denver and Brighton.  This community was a covenant controlled housing development with defined regulations regarding many things including parking restrictions.  I hired a property management company who provided a lease that complied with the neighborhood HOA regulations.  Although the tenants signed the lease indicating the occupants would be a husband & wife with two small children and no pets, they failed to comply with that stipulation.  
I know Paul, and he is one of the most thoughtful people I know. I completely endorse his letter.
Also, it looks like YIMBY are proud they found a way to rig Councilwoman Sawyer‚Äôs poll, ‚Äúyou can fill out as many times as you want in incognito mode.‚Äù
I don't think the person who make that comment lives Sawyer's district and I doubt that he is a YIMBY member. I think he was just making an observation.
Buffy Gilfoil you can read the whole conversation on YIMBY Facebook page.  He was trying to eliminate the preview and open the link to everyone, not just her district which is how it is set up and then he keeps working on it to enable voting as many times as you want. What tech companies do these people work for??
Mrs  Bell
Hi Pauline, Thank you. I‚Äôm usually very quiet. In fact, the people who know me, can‚Äôt believe this is me talking. But, I‚Äôm tired of being quiet and watching our city get destroyed. The muzzle has come off!
Well said.  Thank you.
Our City Counsel Representative Amanda Sawyer put out a questionnaire to get input from the neighborhoods she represents regarding the Group Home proposal.  I am hopeful every City Council member is doing the same. Make your voices heard if you oppose this proposal. This is what democracy looks like.
Except YIMBY has rigged the poll so that they seem to be able to answer numerous times
See above, really??
As a native of Denver, I‚Äôm seriously disheartened by the lack of empathy. This proposal does not just include criminals. We have destroyed so many low income neighborhoods and pushed people out of the only affordable housing in this city. We can‚Äôt do that and then have a problem with these kind of proposals. We take over your backyard but then cry not in my backyard. What do you expect? Then people complain about the homeless problem. If you are that concerned, help fix it instead of just playing Monday morning quarterback. Be part of the solution, address the underlying issues and find compassionate.
Good point. That goes to mayor and zoning and planning departments that let it happen.
Thank you Sir for your message  I concur with you and pray the mayor , representatives, governor will heed to assisting these individuals  with pragmatic living areas to rebuild their lives!!! Let us set up mental health wellness , parameters for job opportunities, accountability/responsibilities the individuals will adhere to and consequences if not met. I do support the rebuilding and building of lives, so all know they have a purpose and contribution to our city , county , state and America. We must let them know they are worthy !!
It‚Äôs so interesting to see the neighborhoods these comments are coming from. You want some white milk to wash down all that white bread? What are you all so afraid of? Thank goodness for diversity and people who care about others who may not look like them. Pretty soon you will all be a minority and won‚Äôt that be interesting to watch. Maybe that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre so afraid of.üßê
^^^ This.  Way to go fellow Mayfairian!  Mayfairite?
Bravo to you!
Thank you, Paul. It takes courage to have an opinion that was not formed in a mob. I presume that you have worked with and defended many people of every color, and I saw no reference to race in your concern. Even so, the attack came. I too, have spent decades working and giving to many people in many nations and almost all in poverty. I love these people, as I love the people in both Denver jails, that I have visited, counseled, taught and prayed with for the last decade.
We are in a national crisis.  Why blame the problem on the most destitute victims of the crisis?  Why can't we find s as nctioned campsites for these victims that includes minimal sanitation and safety facilities to protect them and us?  The adhoc camping facilities should be called Trumpvilles because we have a President who golf's while the citizens suffer.
Yes, just as they did with Hoover during the Great Depression

He said he didn't want it but I left it by him any way.",homeless man know story homeless man wheel chair wheel chair sleep bench morning walk early leave couple snack money day say want leave way,"I have seen him quite a bit as well.  I think this is the same person who was seeking refuge at the Post Office a year or so ago.  Lately, he seems to be by CCGrill, or at least that‚Äôs where I have seen him.  I know there was a lot of community outreach before.  Sounds as though he could benefit from some support again.
He adamantly refuses any offer of help
Does he have white hair?
I've attempted to help him numerous times including trying to give him money or a blanket. He always shakes his head no and won't look at me. It breaks my heart to see him on the street but he's made it clear that he just wants to be left alone.
Is he a middle aged amputee? I tried to offer him assistance on 6th Avenue when he‚Äôd been waiting at a bus stop for over an hour and he was EXTREMELY aggressive - I wouldn‚Äôt recommend approaching him.
Yes. That's him.
We've also tried to help him but he declined all offers we made.  This was all pre-pandemic, but we have spoken with the police about helping him.  They know him and said he has also refused the services they've offered him.
I have beein seeing this man in the neighborhood for a long time.  Someone must drop him off and pick him up each day. I don't know if he sleeps on the street.  For a while he was spending time in the CCN library and I contacted the DPL social worker about him (pre-pandemic of course).  But the chances the social worker would be visiting this branch when the man happened to be there would have been slim and probably never happened.
Some people like suffering. It's the only power he has, to refuse your help.
nobody likes suffering - its called mental illness- no human on earth would chose suffering if they were in their correct and healthy mind
Rachael Cotner My mother LOVED to suffer--I think she thought it gave her brownie points with her sky god.
I think this same guy spent a day over here in Wash Park last week. Same experience-refused assistance
As an Inpatient Psychiatric Nurse at DH, we have lots of patients like the person you are writing about.  I totally understand the need to be compassionate and empathetic, but we must all remember to respect a person's wishes.  If he refuses assistance or donations - so be it.  There is nothing worse than having someone impose ""what they want for us"" when our wishes may simply be to ""be left alone.""  Never hurts to acknowledge the individual but no need to try and do more unless asked.
I agree Brian. As an RN and a direct reporter as are you, at what point should be intervention?
He is a fixture in the neighborhood.  He never accepts any money.
One day, when his bony butt was sitting on a hard plywood seat of his wheel chair, I gave him a good closed foam pad.  He said ""thanks"" but the next time I saw him he didn't have it and said he gave it to a woman who needed it more.
He paid it forward! What more can you ask for.
Mary Bird, is this middle aged man the only homeless person in CCN? I can recall two others; a white male in his 60‚Äôs with long white hair. He had a bike when Hickenlooper bought bikes for the homeless. Then, he was wheelchair bound due to a lost foot. Years before him there was a white woman with a long dress, coat (even in the summer), and hat (she put aluminum foil on it.) She pushed an oversized grocery cart and stayed around the Burger King. Anyone know what happened to them?(edited)
And poor Dennis, who wasn't homeless but looked it; real test of one's compassion, as a head injury made him neglect bathing and grooming. He was very nice and not at all scary, just lonely and brain-damaged.
This is the man with no legs.
I am walking in CCN now. 
I‚Äôve had numerous conversations with the white haired gentleman over the years. He‚Äôs a very gentle soul and quite intelligent. He use to shop at Safeway in CCN till it closed. He lived down on CC south river for a very long time and lost his foot to frost bite. He has a phone and money. He use to be in the oil business and knows many of the old oil guys.
This is so good to know. I used to see him by the library‚Äîyears ago, before it became ‚Äúsmart‚Äù. He would comb his hair and adjust his appearance before entering.
I believe there are 2 men and they are often confused with each other.  Kent (and it may be Ken), who I affectionately call Santa Claus, has a foot amputated and is in a wheelchair, and has been for the past several years.   I understand there is another man and he is a double amputee and I am told he does hang out by the CC post office.  Before he lost his foot, Kent got around with a bicycle.  He used to always come down Cherry Creek South  Dr, but now he uses Cherry Creek North Dr. One day he got off the path and took his wheelchair down toward the creek (I was watching from my apartment window), on the edge thinking he was going to crash the wheelchair and roll into the creek, but he didn't and I was shocked that he maneuvered the chair back up the incline and onto the path. He would sit for a while and watch the creek.  Once when he was there an ambulance and fire truck rolled up, got out and talked to him and left. I'm sure someone saw him and thought he was in peril and called for help, but he didn't need any.  One day I saw him up by 23rd and York. After that, I  saw him at Paneras and asked what he was doing up so far away.  He told me there was an assistance place and he was getting a new wheelchair.  I have never been sure he was homeless, the last time I talked to him he told me he was trying to get into Kavod, I don't know if that has happened or not.  He is nice, he is friendly, he seems interested in things, I enjoy it when I have the chance to talk with him.
Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
The man I believe you are referencing (double amputee) was approached several times by neighbors asking if he needed help/water (it was 90 degrees) etc and he refused - phoned non-emergency number requesting welfare check for him.
I‚Äôve seen him many times on my walks. Bless his heart. Seems he‚Äôs been around quite some time.
Please do not make assumptions about this man, whether it be that he is mentally ill or angry. He is very kind and has same amazing stories. He wants to be left alone and doesn‚Äôt want to be poked and prodded. He doesn‚Äôt want handouts. He has his own money and does get a little cranky when people make assumptions that he needs ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. We would all get cranky if people constantly thought we needed rescuing.
The white haired gentleman is Kent. Several people described him well as intelligent and a gentle soul. I don‚Äôt think he needs or wants help but he loves to talk.  He comes to our church occasionally.  He wouldn‚Äôt yell at someone who tried to help him, but he might say no thank you.  And he would likely give something away to someone he felt needed it more.  Talking with Kent has helped me see homeless people more as people.
Thank you for sharing his name.

Hi, Joyce
Didn't they open up streets for snow removal?
Contract for rental ended.
https://nextdoor.com/p/3ZSq35rntRkk?view=detail
I think a better use of the money would be to address the homelessness problem that exists in the City instead of worrying about a street closure . There are still sidewalks and parks that people can go and enjoy .
Tj Kizuka  The cost was approximately $500K since April for sign rental and daily maintenance. It was primarily paid out of pandemic grant funds. The debate is whether those funds could have provided more direct relief for business and people that need help. Since the City has a $200M budget deficit now, I‚Äôm not sure where the funds will come from next.
Thank you Dean Bartell for looping me in. So many people comment without context or facts. This does to me also seem for the most part negate the argument above about their wasted tax money since these were primarily grants. 
Grants only mean the money doesn't have to be paid back. The Pandemic money comes from our federal taxes and some states contribute as well.
Jessica Sherwood  This is a link to the city‚Äôs update on shared streets. 
I didn‚Äôt understand why the streets were closed to begin with. Not arguing, just really didn‚Äôt get why closing streets made sense.
It‚Äôs time for them to be open. The blockades are a hazard in snow and ice for residents that live on these streets.  Close them again in the springs if still needed for COVID-19.  I don‚Äôt see much pedestrian use or bikes etc. since winter set in.
I have lived between 7th and 8th Avenue for 40 years and have always enjoyed supporting the small businesses on 12th Avenue - Capital Heights Pharmacy, Wild Flowers, Ace Hardware, Pappas Market, and the great Dry Cleaners located there. With 11th closed it cuts off the entire neighborhood and makes me go out around Congress Park to the west to 12th, or out on Colorado Blvd to 13th on the east - both sending a very simple shopping trip into a much longer trip into traffic that I try to avoid. I am glad to see the closures end.

I have lived between 7th and 8th Avenue for 40 years and have always enjoyed supporting the small businesses on 12th Avenue - Capital Heights Pharmacy, Wild Flowers, Ace Hardware, Pappas Market, and the great Dry Cleaners located there. With 11th closed it cuts off the entire neighborhood and makes me go out around Congress Park to the west to 12th, or out on Colorado Blvd to 13th on the east - both sending a very simple shopping trip into a much longer trip into traffic that I try to avoid. I am glad to see the closures end.

I've thought a better way for the stores would be to not put out their paper goods all at once in the morning, but stagger distribution about 4 times per day.
Thank you! Stop stock piling!
I agree. And food items.
I've also tried to order food items that normally would be in pretty good stock quantity but they're out of those things too. It's so frustrating and leaves me without certain food items.

And sellers of things like toilet paper and paper towels online are dramatically raising their prices.  Much of what used to be available on Amazon is now out of stock.
I've tried Amazon I've tried online Target Walmart etc everyone is out of stock so because my sister lives in Aurora I've asked her to check in her area for me. She's got a car and she's not disabled.
My sister finally found some Charmin but she's saying that at Target and Walmart in Aurora, the shelves are so empty. Why are people so panicked and greedy? I order groceries to go and most of what I'm ordering is out of stock and that scares me.
Just FYI I was at King Soopers on monaco and there was plenty of tp and some paper towels
OK I am going to admit that I do have my toilet paper preference because of certain issues so I do stick to that and those are what I can't find. üôÉ
Visited Costco off Santa Fe and Target in Englewood...TP totally sold out both places today.  Humans are crazy!
Herd mentality at the big box stores. People visually see others panic buying or low visual supply in the warehouse. Then anxiety kicks in and boom, you have just created a run.
When I spoke to an employee at Safeway, he said it is a supply chain problem. He said the supply chain is very fragile
But everywhere?
I don‚Äôt understand why the supply chain is so fragile. I looked at stoves and it is a 10 week wait , if the store can order it. Two stores said they were sold out of the stove I wanted and Best Buy said they couldn‚Äôt even order it.
Last night at Target they had plenty of both hand wipes and cleaning wipes. I was annoyed to see they had NO prices listed on any of their cleaning products. Makes me wonder if the prices will go up by the day? They were pricey enough as it was. Did not look at TP and paper products. I'm set with those, still, from just after the last panic buying.
I'm sure panic buying is going on (boo!), but please don't be quick to judge an individual shopper as in some cases the person is shopping for multiple households again.  I was getting dirty looks today for my overloaded cart - no panic buying at all, just 3 households and Thanksgiving for my immediate family. :)
Exceptions to the rule don't count nor is it very often. But we thank you for that for sure!!
Just another perspective here: myvsister volunteers with an organization that runs errands for shut-ins.  She often ends up doing grocery shopping for multiple people at once.  It appears that she is buying LOTS of supplies (like TP) in her cart but she is actually getting one package per client.  She does have a nametag that identifies her as a volunteer.  Just a thiught that some people who seem to be hoarding might actually be doing a service for others who cant get out to shop for themselves.
But thats more the exception than the rule. And those who do what your sister does, have a huge part of my heart! Unfortunately,  there are more panic-buying people than precious people like your sister. Tell her thank you!
This won‚Äôt stop panic buying.  It has to come from the store from the top.  If this is happening where you shop just ask management to put a limit on them.  1 per person.  It works.

175,282,282,158182691,Larry Bell,Hilltop,15 Aug,"I want to share this letter. I wanted to share this letter. Councilman Kashmann: 

For forty-seven years I have made my home in Denver after returning from service in Vietnam. I was attracted to living in Denver because it had a renowned reputation for excellent neighborhood communities and spirit.  I chose Congress Park as the neighborhood in which to live and raise my family, opting to send all three of our children to Denver Public Schools. I volunteered for years on the soccer fields, in the schools, in neighborhood organizations  and in my downtown place of worship.  While we as a family, and I as a practicing lawyer for over forty-four years, assisted those who struggled in our community to meet basic human needs, we felt safe and took pride in neighborhood activities.  I moved to University Park fifteen years ago, when I needed to find a wheelchair accessible home for my daughter (a housing need not addressed or met by Denver's leadership) ; I have continued neighborhood participation and have run for office twice for the University Park area.  

I am therefore appalled and outraged by Denver City Council's apparent effort to disregard the efforts of homeowners and citizens to improve their neighborhoods and develop neighborhood spirit and cohesiveness - open to persons of all racial, ethnic, sexual preferences and social backgrounds, etc  - by undermining the desire of all homeowners to live and raise families in safe, open and livable space, by destroying reasonable density and property use zoning with Group Living mandates.  I was raised in the city of Philadelphia, have lived in a number of high density cities on the East and West Coast, and chose to move to Denver to put those less than desirable experiences behind me.  There is no reason or justification to implant Group Homes with more than three unrelated persons - and their relatives - or Community Corrections half way housing or drug rehab facilities in neighborhoods where young children, play, ride their bikes and walk to school.  As a defense attorney, I have first hand knowledge of the unsafe conditions that attend half way houses and drug rehab centers. No Denver resident should be unaware of the issues posed by current un-monitored ""camp sites"" in family centered neighborhoods, with attendant drug use, crime and health issues.  At the same time, certain City Council politicians seek to defund the police and offer us the chaos and vandalism of downtown Denver; shame on them !   

The Group Home approach reflects a lazy, non creative, and foolish approach to issues that demand intellect and commonsense - spread the problem and pander to certain ideologues and constituents, while doing nothing to address the mental illness, drug abuse, and hopelessness of those on the streets, or cramming more people into homes and neighborhoods where the infrastructure is lacking and the likelihood of those people becoming part of the community is next to nil.  Denver is large enough to implement creative housing options and ""campsites"" that offer basic services and security, without trashing existing neighborhoods. Do citizens really want the unsafe and unhealthy circumstances of Civic Center Park and the downtown Denver Library to be superimposed on our safe neighborhoods? A resounding NO is the answer. 

Councilman Kashmann - represent your constituents and stop cowering to the radicals on City Council that are spearheading this destructive effort, that will lead to families leaving the City for safer neighborhoods. I will look for your leadership in the days ahead.  

Paul Linton, Esq.

It seems that council members vote their agenda and not the will of their constituents.  There are 2 ways to correct that.  One is voting at election time, the other is recall.
I agree
Why are comments being deleted?
shame on you. NIMBY is another way to promote us v them, systemic racism and shame people who have had issues. This is EVERYONE‚ÄôS problem, and we all have to do our part.
Francesca, why are the people whom disagree with you racist? Please, out neighborhood is a very nice neighborhood and wanting to keep it that way is simple common sense, not an attack on anybody else.
Francesca, beginning your response with shame on you  was sufficient enough to let everyone know how you feel about Mr Linton and others who don‚Äôt have the same thoughts you have.
I don‚Äôt know Mr. Linton, or many others on this thread, nor did I pretend to. The sentiments expressed by Mr. Linton and others are EXACTLY part of the problem. You say you agree with equality and the American dream for everyone, but not if it affects you. One is part of the problem or part of the solution. How do we reconcile equality and NIMBY?  I‚Äôd love it if someone could actually address a point of view other than Mr. Linton‚Äôs.
Thank you Larry & Paul!  My thoughts exactly.  I have lived in this very charming neighborhood for 30+ years.  Having cheap high density housing does not make for a pleasant city, and will just turn these neighborhoods into crowded non-relaxing noisy urban sprall.  Remember once those changes are made, there is no turning back!
Paul - perfectly stated, 
Denver‚Äôs a city, a growing city. Density is a hallmark of inclusiveness and diversity. Inclusivity and opposition to flexibility in zoning codes that allow for density and other forms of development are diametrically opposed. Further more, substantial research demonstrates that neither density or halfway houses diminish property values.  If you‚Äôd prefer a city that caters to wealthy white homeowners only, feel free to move to cherry hills village with the rest of your conservative friends...and if you fancied yourself a liberal, take a look at the history of exclusionary zoning and it‚Äôs racist roots, then take a look in the mirror and ask if you‚Äôre the type of person that would like to perpetuate that racist history.
Congress Park is already very dense and racially inclusive. 
Well spoken. Please run for office. I will work for your campaign.
Me too!
Apparently these days all tax paying citizens need to sit down and shut up or you're a racist. Just take whatever they force down your throats because otherwise they'll be at your door. Forget that we have always given to charities, forget that we love ALL our neighbors be they a different color than us, forget that we pay taxes every day that supports our elected officials and social programs throughout the entire neighborhood.  That's not enough because no matter what, we are all racist because we were born white. 
This is not an excellent letter. I read a lot about you were this and you are that. But really nothing of substance. 
Well said
You care about people as long as they don‚Äôt live next to you and ruin your ‚Äúneighborhood character‚Äù. Got it.
If there is accountability in these situations where there are reasonable ways to address concerns, I wholeheartedly agree with community housing options. I don't think it makes sense to make permanent arrangements that cannot be changed without an impossible act of congress. If there is some flexibility in how concerned neighbors can expect reasonable standards for safety and hygiene, for all neighbors to adhere to and experience reasonable consequences to address those concerns, I absolutely agree. 
Focusing on the color of one's skin is not getting any of us anywhere. If you are after ""diversity,"" why define it by one's skin color? In the political candidate realm, let's define diversity based on policies, not skin color. It is against the law to discriminate negatively, and it used to be against the law to discriminate positively, based on race or religion. People changed that with ""affirmative action,"" and look where that got to. Few people still seem able to define ""discriminate"" or ""diversify.""
Not focusing on the color of one‚Äôs skin is the ideal, Joan. I join with you in hoping that someday we get there. But we aren‚Äôt anywhere close yet, as we‚Äôve seen in recent times, and in the stories we‚Äôve heard throughout the decades.
Francesca Cheroutes I completely agree! Not focusing on skin colors and the racist history of Denver is a denial of that reality. Denver, like many cities, is an outgrowth of racist roots. Those roots are yielding a fruit that, while less overt, is still an echo of that racism. An open and inclusive discussion must recognize that race is, and remains, a factor in both the history of this nation and this city. Less than 100 years ago the Klan and Nazi apologist played a prevalent role in shaping the Denver of today. Only a conscious recognition of that fact can being the process of dismantling it.
I believe that a recognition of the past without blaming people of today who fight against every form of racism and discrimination is a productive way to move forward.

Nor do I want to be denied a credit card because of my father's lousy credit.Regardless of how abusive he may have been, it does not remove my personal responsibility today.
I agree with you completely. Blame is not really helpful on a micro, or personal level. We need to ficus on the problems (and that‚Äôs a HUGE ask) and ask what we can do going forward. But it won‚Äôt always be comfortable, or easy, and it will require personal reflection and awareness going forward. As for the issue that started this thread, we work WITH the lawmakers, we are open about what our true fears are, we listen to the other side, and we come up with a compromise. THAT is American. THAT is being a community. And clearly everyone on this board has something to say and wants to be heard.

","I want to share this letter. I wanted to share this letter. Councilman Kashmann: 

For forty-seven years I have made my home in Denver after returning from service in Vietnam. I was attracted to living in Denver because it had a renowned reputation for excellent neighborhood communities and spirit.  I chose Congress Park as the neighborhood in which to live and raise my family, opting to send all three of our children to Denver Public Schools. I volunteered for years on the soccer fields, in the schools, in neighborhood organizations  and in my downtown place of worship.  While we as a family, and I as a practicing lawyer for over forty-four years, assisted those who struggled in our community to meet basic human needs, we felt safe and took pride in neighborhood activities.  I moved to University Park fifteen years ago, when I needed to find a wheelchair accessible home for my daughter (a housing need not addressed or met by Denver's leadership) ; I have continued neighborhood participation and have run for office twice for the University Park area.  

I am therefore appalled and outraged by Denver City Council's apparent effort to disregard the efforts of homeowners and citizens to improve their neighborhoods and develop neighborhood spirit and cohesiveness - open to persons of all racial, ethnic, sexual preferences and social backgrounds, etc  - by undermining the desire of all homeowners to live and raise families in safe, open and livable space, by destroying reasonable density and property use zoning with Group Living mandates.  I was raised in the city of Philadelphia, have lived in a number of high density cities on the East and West Coast, and chose to move to Denver to put those less than desirable experiences behind me.  There is no reason or justification to implant Group Homes with more than three unrelated persons - and their relatives - or Community Corrections half way housing or drug rehab facilities in neighborhoods where young children, play, ride their bikes and walk to school.  As a defense attorney, I have first hand knowledge of the unsafe conditions that attend half way houses and drug rehab centers. No Denver resident should be unaware of the issues posed by current un-monitored ""camp sites"" in family centered neighborhoods, with attendant drug use, crime and health issues.  At the same time, certain City Council politicians seek to defund the police and offer us the chaos and vandalism of downtown Denver; shame on them !   

The Group Home approach reflects a lazy, non creative, and foolish approach to issues that demand intellect and commonsense - spread the problem and pander to certain ideologues and constituents, while doing nothing to address the mental illness, drug abuse, and hopelessness of those on the streets, or cramming more people into homes and neighborhoods where the infrastructure is lacking and the likelihood of those people becoming part of the community is next to nil.  Denver is large enough to implement creative housing options and ""campsites"" that offer basic services and security, without trashing existing neighborhoods. Do citizens really want the unsafe and unhealthy circumstances of Civic Center Park and the downtown Denver Library to be superimposed on our safe neighborhoods? A resounding NO is the answer. 

Councilman Kashmann - represent your constituents and stop cowering to the radicals on City Council that are spearheading this destructive effort, that will lead to families leaving the City for safer neighborhoods. I will look for your leadership in the days ahead.  

Paul Linton, Esq. 
University Park.Great letter.  It seems that council members vote their agenda and not the will of their constituents.  There are 2 ways to correct that.  One is voting at election time, the other is recall.
I agree
Why are comments being deleted?
shame on you. NIMBY is another way to promote us v them, systemic racism and shame people who have had issues. This is EVERYONE‚ÄôS problem, and we all have to do our part.
Francesca, why are the people whom disagree with you racist? Please, out neighborhood is a very nice neighborhood and wanting to keep it that way is simple common sense, not an attack on anybody else.
Francesca, beginning your response with shame on you  was sufficient enough to let everyone know how you feel about Mr Linton and others who don‚Äôt have the same thoughts you have.
I don‚Äôt know Mr. Linton, or many others on this thread, nor did I pretend to. The sentiments expressed by Mr. Linton and others are EXACTLY part of the problem. You say you agree with equality and the American dream for everyone, but not if it affects you. One is part of the problem or part of the solution. How do we reconcile equality and NIMBY?  I‚Äôd love it if someone could actually address a point of view other than Mr. Linton‚Äôs.
Thank you Larry & Paul!  My thoughts exactly.  I have lived in this very charming neighborhood for 30+ years.  Having cheap high density housing does not make for a pleasant city, and will just turn these neighborhoods into crowded non-relaxing noisy urban sprall.  Remember once those changes are made, there is no turning back!
Paul - perfectly stated, 
Denver‚Äôs a city, a growing city. Density is a hallmark of inclusiveness and diversity. Inclusivity and opposition to flexibility in zoning codes that allow for density and other forms of development are diametrically opposed. Further more, substantial research demonstrates that neither density or halfway houses diminish property values.  If you‚Äôd prefer a city that caters to wealthy white homeowners only, feel free to move to cherry hills village with the rest of your conservative friends...and if you fancied yourself a liberal, take a look at the history of exclusionary zoning and it‚Äôs racist roots, then take a look in the mirror and ask if you‚Äôre the type of person that would like to perpetuate that racist history.
Congress Park is already very dense and racially inclusive. 
Well spoken. Please run for office. I will work for your campaign.
Me too!
Apparently these days all tax paying citizens need to sit down and shut up or you're a racist. Just take whatever they force down your throats because otherwise they'll be at your door. Forget that we have always given to charities, forget that we love ALL our neighbors be they a different color than us, forget that we pay taxes every day that supports our elected officials and social programs throughout the entire neighborhood.  That's not enough because no matter what, we are all racist because we were born white. 
This is not an excellent letter. I read a lot about you were this and you are that. But really nothing of substance. 
Well said
You care about people as long as they don‚Äôt live next to you and ruin your ‚Äúneighborhood character‚Äù. Got it.
If there is accountability in these situations where there are reasonable ways to address concerns, I wholeheartedly agree with community housing options. I don't think it makes sense to make permanent arrangements that cannot be changed without an impossible act of congress. If there is some flexibility in how concerned neighbors can expect reasonable standards for safety and hygiene, for all neighbors to adhere to and experience reasonable consequences to address those concerns, I absolutely agree. 
Focusing on the color of one's skin is not getting any of us anywhere. If you are after ""diversity,"" why define it by one's skin color? In the political candidate realm, let's define diversity based on policies, not skin color. It is against the law to discriminate negatively, and it used to be against the law to discriminate positively, based on race or religion. People changed that with ""affirmative action,"" and look where that got to. Few people still seem able to define ""discriminate"" or ""diversify.""
Not focusing on the color of one‚Äôs skin is the ideal, Joan. I join with you in hoping that someday we get there. But we aren‚Äôt anywhere close yet, as we‚Äôve seen in recent times, and in the stories we‚Äôve heard throughout the decades.
Francesca Cheroutes I completely agree! Not focusing on skin colors and the racist history of Denver is a denial of that reality. Denver, like many cities, is an outgrowth of racist roots. Those roots are yielding a fruit that, while less overt, is still an echo of that racism. An open and inclusive discussion must recognize that race is, and remains, a factor in both the history of this nation and this city. Less than 100 years ago the Klan and Nazi apologist played a prevalent role in shaping the Denver of today. Only a conscious recognition of that fact can being the process of dismantling it.
I believe that a recognition of the past without blaming people of today who fight against every form of racism and discrimination is a productive way to move forward. Blaming EVERY issue on past circumstances would allow me to have my father arrested for my criminal acts today. Nor do I want to be denied a credit card because of my father's lousy credit.Regardless of how abusive he may have been, it does not remove my personal responsibility today.
I agree with you completely. Blame is not really helpful on a micro, or personal level. We need to ficus on the problems (and that‚Äôs a HUGE ask) and ask what we can do going forward. But it won‚Äôt always be comfortable, or easy, and it will require personal reflection and awareness going forward.

177,285,285,147452844,Trey Isom,City Park,8 May 20,"Remember when we used to complain about goose poop in the parks? Can we get back to that?
Those were the days.",remember complain goose poop park day,"Ah yes,  Can't believe I miss the goose poop.
We nurse squirrels back to life which to me are rodents but kill the geese where do we draw the line on what‚Äôs worth saving, I think I‚Äôve heard of people eating squirrels too.
I miss the guys and gals that make it too!  Wildlife should not be destroyed or thrown out like trash when it is inconvenient for human beings.
What happened to them!!?
Jude Wolf meals for the homeless
Well Trey many complaints were that there was too much poop, and were not really concerned how they were going to get rid of it they supposedly using it to fe Ed people. The city could have just hired more people to clean it up. I thought it was horrible that people wanted to get rid of them because it was inconvenient. What if people were just killed because they were a pain in the ass. There would not be a lot of humans right depending who was choosing.
I want my taxes going up to clean poop at  21.00 per hr when benefis are included. City Park is only  one of many with geese problem. Hopefully more foxes will get the eggs when golf course fence goes down and coyotedo there thing. Unfortunately the natural Urban Wildlife is not doing its job properly. If you have kids playing soccer or a baby getter intlo their poop and heaven forbid eat it or stick their fingers in it and put the small fingers in their mouths. Surveys we're done and your oppion was in the minority by far. Thank Goodness.
Part of the problem is that natural predators had been eliminated - what was the last fox, hawk, or coyote you saw in the park?  With no natural predators, there were too many geese for the space and the poop was too much for an urban park.  What did all those geese do to the water quality of the lakes?  And to the quality/safety of the fish that some folks fish for food?  When we interefere in the natural processes perhaps we have a responsibility to restore balance and even be the missing predator.
I have seen people fish in that lake but it never looked clean before geese. I don‚Äôt really believe it was that many fish in that lake if so they should have caught the fish to feed hungry, either one looked scary to eat. We use to have a red fox that ran thru our neighborhood but there were a lot of feral cats when they disappeared the fox did too.
And why were the natural predators eliminated?  Mankind?  What were the goose to do?  So sad on so many different levels.  Sigh...
So in order to maintain balance of the geese population, would you be ok with bringing back the natural predators to roam the city? I get its not pleasant to think about, but besides culling, what solution would you find acceptable?
Goose tastes very good. If these people saw how vaste majority of  pigs and chickens  are raised they wouldn't be complaining as much about a few hundred geese City wide. Maybe they would complianing is a way for life if one doesn't use reason to  analyze a problem. I had to inspect a hog farm in Logan County near Peetz and had a bad head ache for 6 hrs with sinusitis hurting also.  The factory farm was fully in compliance. The farm owner if he had not gone that route would have lost his family's farm according to his brother that I respected. He was older and had less debt so while offered a similar deal turned it down.
SMOKED goose is awesome!!!  Use to have it for Christmas.  At home in ND our pets negotiated away from Great Horned Owls, Eagles (Golden and Bald), Hawks, weasels (got my rabbit), fox (got my cat) and coyote & raccoons & skunks.   Now how do you think these will live in Denver.  If you want all these predators in your life - just move to the country and enjoy them and the deer eating your nice trees and flowers, et al.  Nothing like accidentally stepping on deer poop or another animal cleaning your flower beds.  This is a metropolitan city - this is not a small town of 125 people where wildlife can hide and survive.  As a farm kid you learn about life (calving season was a favorite) (cows in heat) and death early in life.  I didn't have to read a book to know about the birds and the bees - it just happens in front of you.  Ken Strohson is right about pigs - I've seen worms on patient's brain CT Scans from eating undercooked pork.  Won't touch it.
I think I‚Äôve heard that it was good but never tried it, duck and rabbit for me, it just sounded so inhuman I‚Äôve tasted veal also but it had a wild taste to me. When I ate rabbit my mom tricked us and said it was baked chicken, she was from the south so these really familiar dishes to her, I think I remember her talking about goose as well. This thread is making me sad and reminding me how much I miss her.
Happy Mother‚Äôs Day! To all the mothers that make special memories in our lives.
Mom got her smoked goose from the Hutterites.  They raise them along with chickens and turkeys to sell.

Also, google Councilperson CdeBaca and Halfway Houses.
Hi Nancy, once again your post is spreading false information in our community. I have asked you repeatedly to stop this behavior as these tactics are unacceptable. Your comment indicates a clear misunderstanding of the way our government works and passes along half the facts to the community. 
I don‚Äôt see the need to use the term Trumpian tactics in your response. It is no more useful than using Obamaesque or Clintonian tactics. You are not necessarily elected representing either party but you seem to want to bring politics into play immediately when people in your district are trying to get answers rather than get into a political bent discussion
The Mayor is not in charge of zoning. That is clearly city council‚Äôs sole responsibility. I don‚Äôt know who chooses the director of the CPD but to think that city council doesn‚Äôt have any authority over the CPD seems very odd. Please explain this to me. I am just trying to bring this to the attention of the constituents so they can make their own wishes known.
Hi Nancy, Denver has a ‚Äústrong Mayor‚Äù form of government. All city agency heads are appointed solely by the Mayor and all Agencies report solely to the Mayor. As a quick aside, if this concerns you, know that I have introduced a Charter change amendment that will go to the voters in November 2020 that would give City Council approval of 14 Mayoral appointments including the head of CPD.
Thank you for the clarifications. Please educate us on what actions we can take immediately to change it or stop it from going to committee. What has to happen to get other council members to üëé on it?(edited)
Hi Julie, I would write emails to other Councilmembers as well as to the Community Planning and Development department. You can find out more information at denvergov.org/groupliving. I hope that helps!
Hi Julie let me see if I can help you.  Below are a list of contacts with their names. email, twitter.  I couldn't find emails for everyone but I found either a twitter account or you can always call too for those who don't have email.  All you need to do is copy paste this message into each post:  ""Absolutely NO.  Not in my city. I am a NO for the proposed Group Living Amendment. VOTE NO.""   I would send it as many times as you like to the following people and as quickly as you can.
Nancy is not educating anyone. Nancy is either misinformed or intentionally spreading misinformation. Either way her version of the process is incorrect. This is all publicly accessible information. By simply using google I was able to see the flaws in her post. 
I‚Äôm not an expert on city government, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt use my common sense. Could you please tell me specifically what the flaws in my posts are?(edited)
My guess would be the city and the government of Denver
Huh??
Steffan Tubbs interviews Jane Prancan, 17 year Chairman of Denver Community Corrections Board who is opposed to this initiative:
Per Florence S.:  Another concern with this proposal is allowing all of the changes as ""use by right"". This means, as a use, they are automatically allowed. Instead of issuing permits as needed, use by right has very little accountability. A permit can be revoked if the holder abuses the Code; use by right has no recourse.
The proposed Group Living Amendment is complicated and applies to Congregate Living situations (e.g. Half way houses, sober living communities, etc.) and to more residential arrangements.  The permitted density is very high especially if the relatives of a resident and  affiliated minors are included.  
It‚Äôs not that complicated.  Let me simplify it for you.  (This isn‚Äôt meant harshly just straight forward.). Its about ‚Äòfor profit‚Äô  companies wanting to cram as many convicted felons in our residential neighborhoods üè´ so these companies can make a greater profit off housing these felons.  These are serious offenders including those with convictions of violent assaults, car jacking, child molesters, sexual predators.  This new amendment allows these felons to live next to us in homes, on our blocks in our neighborhoods and next to our schools.  This new amendment also does not require that we are notified that these felons have been placed in group homes in our neighborhoods.  If there are less than 10 in one home.  Also no supervision is required of these individuals living in these homes except they need to check in at night.

Nancy:  GLAC (the Group Living Advisory Committee) an insider group (wishing to remain unamed) brought this proposal to City Council in/around 2018. GLAC is a commercial 'for profit' advisory group with 48 members/companies.

Why has this post ‚Äúbeen removed‚Äù?
","Who initiated the Group Living/Halfway House Proposal. My husband emailed Andrew Webb, Senior City Planner, CPD (Community Planning Department), he asked, who initiated and thought up this proposal (bundling/coupling it with community corrections, homeless shelters,sobriety, co-op‚Äôs, etc)?  Andrew‚Äôs email response was:

‚Äúat the request of city agency directors and City Council Members.‚Äù

So, üëçor üëéis not really the only input by City Council.So apparently this was initiated by city council members and will be passed or not by city council members; therefore, constituents must contact their city council member and tell them if they vote for this, they will not be re-elected.(edited)
Also, google Councilperson CdeBaca and Halfway Houses.
Hi Nancy, once again your post is spreading false information in our community. I have asked you repeatedly to stop this behavior as these tactics are unacceptable. Your comment indicates a clear misunderstanding of the way our government works and passes along half the facts to the community. 
I don‚Äôt see the need to use the term Trumpian tactics in your response. It is no more useful than using Obamaesque or Clintonian tactics. You are not necessarily elected representing either party but you seem to want to bring politics into play immediately when people in your district are trying to get answers rather than get into a political bent discussion
The Mayor is not in charge of zoning. That is clearly city council‚Äôs sole responsibility. I don‚Äôt know who chooses the director of the CPD but to think that city council doesn‚Äôt have any authority over the CPD seems very odd. Please explain this to me. I am just trying to bring this to the attention of the constituents so they can make their own wishes known.
Hi Nancy, Denver has a ‚Äústrong Mayor‚Äù form of government. All city agency heads are appointed solely by the Mayor and all Agencies report solely to the Mayor. As a quick aside, if this concerns you, know that I have introduced a Charter change amendment that will go to the voters in November 2020 that would give City Council approval of 14 Mayoral appointments including the head of CPD.
Thank you for the clarifications. Please educate us on what actions we can take immediately to change it or stop it from going to committee. What has to happen to get other council members to üëé on it?(edited)
Hi Julie, I would write emails to other Councilmembers as well as to the Community Planning and Development department. You can find out more information at denvergov.org/groupliving. I hope that helps!
Hi Julie let me see if I can help you.  Below are a list of contacts with their names. email, twitter.  I couldn't find emails for everyone but I found either a twitter account or you can always call too for those who don't have email.  All you need to do is copy paste this message into each post:  ""Absolutely NO.  Not in my city. I am a NO for the proposed Group Living Amendment. VOTE NO.""   I would send it as many times as you like to the following people and as quickly as you can.
Nancy is not educating anyone. Nancy is either misinformed or intentionally spreading misinformation. Either way her version of the process is incorrect. This is all publicly accessible information. By simply using google I was able to see the flaws in her post. 
I‚Äôm not an expert on city government, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt use my common sense. Could you please tell me specifically what the flaws in my posts are?(edited)
My guess would be the city and the government of Denver
Huh??

I have heard that using a ""Club"" on your steering wheel is what police recommend for cars that are frequently stolen. It is a device that prevents your steering wheel from being turned. There are a few companies that make versions of them. I think you can get them at Walmart. I think they are around $30 each. Might be worth the investment in a place where there are frequent car thefts.
At one point the District 6 Police Department were giving them away.  Don't know if they still have them.

Do they need maternity clothes now? I heard they typically welcome maternity clothes and called a few weeks ago to ask about donating, but the person said they weren't accepting anything at that time. I have a ton of maternity clothes, mostly summer items, ready to go.

If you live in a place where you have to clean your own sidewalks or walkways, or (dig your car out if it comes to that) a shovel comes in handy and will probably be needed. March snow is heavy and wet! 
Booze, food, pet food, candles. If you are low on prescription drugs refill them early; not because you‚Äôll need them, but because it will put your mind at ease to have them around. (I have a spare for my script in my car and my home- all year long.) 
Thank you! Very helpful. I grew up in Pennsylvania so I have good childhood memories. 20 years in Texas dulled my skills.
Booze.  Food is over rated
Plan on food that doesn‚Äôt need cooked or warmed up in case of power outages. Think ‚Äúsnacks!‚Äù
A good flashlight for safety and a comfy knit hat to wear to bed for additional warmth should be on your list.
Assuming your house is already winterized, just stock up on food

Denver is no Texas but you may be on to something. Don‚Äôt forget the aquaphor, T-word and water. Keep us posted!
This will likely be pretty wet, heavy snow.  Plan on shoveling a few inches every cohple of hours - its much easier to move 2 inches at a time a couple times than 8 inches (or however mich we get) at the end of the storm. Plus it'll help burn off the calories from the booze and snacks!
Home Depot on Colo Blvd is SOLD OUT of shovels, but I did see some at the King Soopers on Leetsdale (outside near the front entrance & firewood).

Denver Colorado better be more prepared for this than Texas.
Booze and food should do it.  Gas in your tank is always a good idea. It's funny how many of these historic storms seem to miss us when the time comes.
This isn't Austin, TX. Power shortages usually don't last long, but prepare in the usual ways in case it happens. Shovel your sidewalk! (Pro-tip: use WD-40 or even olive oil spray on your shovel.)
That's interesting, what does the oil do?

Too many Tide Pods for that fine citizen. Any report back from DPD?
Definitley on some drugs. I saw dpd show up but it was 4 am and didnt want to talk to an officer so no clue the end...
Please do file a written police report with as much detail as you can remember. Many times those types of behaviors are gateways to more significant crimes. Any way we can support those in our community to get the help they need early, helps the whole community

You call EMS/police to protect themselves from themself.  They aren‚Äôt thinking rationally and are making poor judgements about safety.   Most likely he was high on meth.
Why would you call the police? ACAB
ALL PAX8 EMPLOYEES ARE BAD
I wish there was a way to call Adult Protective Services or some mental health organization. He could have had a head injury etc. As a caring person I would have wanted to intervene but unsure how. Life is difficult for me during the pandemic. What‚Äôs it like for those homeless, addicted, suffering mental illness?
Because sometimes they run down the middle of Colfax nude and paranoid and clearly delusional and combative.
Yes if someone is trying to break into my house it is warfare because they're threatening my family. I hope you're never forced to truly put your idealism to the test.
Had that happened to me, he would have gotten shot

Never leave anything of value in your car. I would certainly make sure your watching your credit and such if someone got personal information.
Cars are very frequent but garages and homes also get hit. Not now really since everyone is home. But certainly important to lock up.
Angel Martinez stolen documents like registration and insurance can lead to identity theft. I‚Äôd file a police report; because you want as much evidence as possible backing you up.
Got my car stolen earlier this year, be careful. And it was locked your lucky they didn‚Äôt take yours.(edited)
Sadly I would say it is normal  now. We had our cars gone through.  Learned my lesson to lock cars now.
Unseemly folks looking for unlocked car doors is a problem in every big city.  The simple thing to do is to lock your car and house!!!  Double check if you need to but take away the thief's opportunity.  Particularly in the warm months there are many more people outside at all times of day and night.
Would never leave a car unlocked this is a big city with real big city issues, cars are stolen even when they are locked.
It is common all over the city, Congress Park included, if you leave your car doors unlocked.  And I believe it will only get worse as the economic situation  gets rougher for everybody.
It‚Äôs happened to us a couple of times. They took all my car papers too and found several of the things taken thrown out a car window a few blocks away. A neighbor returned my car manual they found in front of their house. Go for a walk you might find some things.
I actually expect my car to be rummaged thru if it‚Äôs left unlocked. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt?
I have two friends whose cars have been rummaged through and items stolen more than 5 times in the last two years when they didn‚Äôt lock their cars. A friend whose tools were stolen when his truck was broken into, and a friend whose car was stolen in broad daylight in January, while neighbors were in their yards. All in this neighborhood. I lock my car any time I get out of it and I leave nothing of value in eyesight.
I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. It is not a nice welcome to the neighborhood. But folks are right: Lock your vehicle. Do not leave anything of value in the car, even if locked. Life in the big city.
One, it helps others to know the intersection you are near. Congress Park is still a big place. Two, yes, breakins on unlocked cars, packages filched from porches, even loose items from alleys all seem to be fair game. Probably worse in this economic downturn. Three, yes you should be concerned about identity theft. Good luck, be careful.
It‚Äôs so common. Both mine and my husbands car have been rummaged through twice, mine has been stole once. I‚Äôm sorry :/
You leave your car unlocked? This goes on in EVERY neighborhood around here.(edited)
Look at my post history and you‚Äôll see I caught one live and confronted him.  You‚Äôre also going to have your packages stolen too.
I think it is wise to lock your car in any urban neighborhood in the country.  There are unsavory opportunists and unfortunate people who have very little  who are tempted by an unlocked car.
https://youtu.be/mRkpPV62VVk car burglary video.
People who do this often walk down the street at night testing door handles until they find an unlocked car. Best to double check when you leave your vehicle so you‚Äôre not a target!
It‚Äôs very common. There‚Äôs a group of homeless people that stay on the 13th and Colorado corner, it‚Äôs most likely them.
Definitely super common, happened to me a few weeks ago. It‚Äôs always when I leave it unlocked.
PS... It is not on random nights. It‚Äôs every night, so be diligent.(edited)

Haha that‚Äôs funny!!!
Are you at the Detroit apartment?  I live on the other side of the alley and it woke me up.   There are often people in that open car port creating noise and mess.  I‚Äôve talked to the Detroit management company and the police, but no one seems to care.
I‚Äôm at Detroit Terraces. It‚Äôs just so bad, I mean last night was nice and quiet. I contacted the management again. They said to keep calling the police and also their emergency maintenance line. So next time I will do that. I know a lot of people that messaged me gave up calling the police but I know if we called every time it would help them to actually get here and deal with this. That car port is private property. I‚Äôm just tired of it waking my 3 year old in the middle of her sleep.
What‚Äôs the ph for emergency maintenance?
Maybe 311
Get off my lawn! Bah humbug
Good idea. Stay off someone elses property.
Get a recording of police sirens, or get a bull horn.
Concealed carry.
I guess announcing that you are armed is a good way to get the cops to finally show up... if this isn't the point of your comment I have to assume you are alluding to murder.(edited)
I recommend playing Mmmmbop at 11
Maybe buy some smoke bombs online.
If there is some sort of management report to them, I would also call police again let them know you had called previously and no one came. Please don't confront yourself.
Hi! I live on the alley side and I call the non-emergency line every time they are loud so I totally understand. I don't know what else to do unless we group together against management for cameras and maybe random security checks?
I hope they do something! I do too! Maybe we can also email the management each time it‚Äôs happening?  So they get annoyed too?
","How is this acceptable? Last night from about 11:00pm- 12:45am there was music blasting what seemed right below in the car port (open garage thing). It seemed like it was some teens or possibly homeless. It‚Äôs private property. 

We have called the police and they didn‚Äôt show. 
Going there to check it out ourselves is super scary. 

But we have jobs that we must be up for during the day and a toddler! Some respect towards residents could be a nice thing. 

Any advice on how to deal with this kind of stuff? It‚Äôs an occurrence ‚Äî it‚Äôs either music or homeless screaming all night.

They need to stop releasing predators to the streets.This is the second one this month. They can not be tracked and its unfair to the population.
They r required to report where they r living and can‚Äôt stay in a proximity that is close to schools etc.
There r a lot of predators on Park ave as well, LifeLock notifies me all the time of predators in that area as well as other surrounding areas.
Oh no!

Yeah well you can take the risk of a sexually violent predator in his 60s might changing his ways. Im not going to though.

Once they get released they all must go to that location, occasionally there r other addresses.

203,335,335,157268079,Nancy Bell,Hilltop,6 Aug,"Community Corrections-Group Living. From Florence Sebern:
Jane Prancan, 17-year member of the Denver Community Corrections Board, answered some questions and commented about the Group Living Zoning Code Amendment and it's connection to Denver Community Corrections.

Q&A with Jane Prancan, August 3, 2020

Q: Can the business model for Denver community corrections accept candidates from other jurisdictions?  
A: Yes, candidates can be accepted from any jurisdiction in Colorado ‚Äì referrals from both the Department of Corrections and Judicial Department (probation).

Q: Do persons eligible for community corrections within Denver limits need to be Denverites?  
A: No, they can be from any jurisdiction in the state.

Q: Can the community corrections business model that steps into the GEO/CoreCivic void, grow beyond what is needed to serve our Denver system?  
A: There is no limit to the number of clients in any facility except zoning and the ability to receive reimbursement from the State for each client.

Council members are leading the effort to create community corrections in small houses in neighborhoods with little to no supervision. They claim that all community corrections clients are simply low level drug offenders.  I might note that no City Council member has ever attended a community corrections meeting.

Low level drug offenders present certain challenges, but community corrections does not place only low level drug offenders.

Thus far, at the four Community Corrections meetings in July 2020, following is the breakdown of sentencing crimes for offenders reviewed. Crimes vary from month to month. This list is typical of the cases reviewed.  It is also important to note that every one of the offenders referred has a lengthy criminal background including misdemeanors and felonies.
‚Ä¢ Assault-usually 2nd degree ‚Äì 21
‚Ä¢ Dangerous drugs-manufacture/sale ‚Äì 10
‚Ä¢ Menacing ‚Äì 8
‚Ä¢ Homicide ‚Äì 4
‚Ä¢ Aggravated robbery (usually with a weapon) ‚Äì 15
‚Ä¢ Aggravated motor vehicle theft (carjacking) ‚Äì 5
‚Ä¢ Vehicular assault ‚Äì 2
‚Ä¢ Child abuse ‚Äì 1
‚Ä¢ Sex offense ‚Äì 5
‚Ä¢ Kidnapping ‚Äì 2
‚Ä¢ Weapons ‚Äì 5
‚Ä¢ Others including identity theft, extortion, fraud, dangerous drugs, stalking, organized crime (usually gang related) forgery and trespass (often domestic violence) ‚Äì 17

The numbers, above, are for individual offenders and the crime of conviction that resulted in each one being sentenced to the Department of Corrections. Many persons have multiple offenses, for example: a person convicted of armed robbery will also have additional charges for unlawful possession of weapons; kidnapping is often accompanied by assault charges.

I have long been a supporter of Community Corrections and worked with communities to assure safety for the neighborhoods.  Now encouraging violent offenders with little to no supervision and few services is troubling.  This new effort is of great concern to me.""

The Denver Community Corrections Board oversees the acceptance and rejection criteria for all offenders considered for placement in the Denver Community Corrections Residential program.

Board responsibilities include reviewing all matters relating to Community Corrections and when appropriate, advising the city on actions to be taken.

The Board acts on behalf of the citizens of Denver to ensure the protection of the community and to safeguard the rights of residents, provide for the needs of offenders who will be supervised by Community Corrections, act as a liaison for Denver with other city and state agencies and establish policies and procedures that govern the administration of the program and criteria for acceptance into the program.

My first instinct was someone being shot and screaming in pain, it was terrifying. But nope, I look out my window to see a man breaking into my car. 

Be careful out there guys. He busted my window in, and I yelled at him to get away from my car through my apartment window and he took off running and luckily with no items.

The strange part? I had absolutely nothing valuable in my car, nor did I have anything in my car out in plain sight besides my fold up massage table (I'm an esthetician) The motive was strange; as he made a lot of noise and drew attention to himself.

This is just a warning, it happened to another neighbor in the same building. Make sure you don't leave valuables inside your car- break ins are happening left and right. I spent my entire Saturday getting the window fixed. I have reported this information to the police.

It's getting so bad :( And my only option is street parking so who's to say it won't happen again?
Just make sure all valuables are out of car. I hope it doesn't happen again.
That is disturbing. I just moved into the neighborhood and love it! I won‚Äôt let the thugs push me out. I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you.
I live on colfax with a lot of foot traffic, especially from the homeless as well. I have multiple problems in this neighborhood quite frequently but I assume it also is partially due to living on a Main Street. I will be leaving this neighborhood though once my lease is over. I can‚Äôt take it anymore :(
Brittany Hagood I understand. I hope wherever you move it ends up being a great space for you. Take care of yourself

The strange part? I had absolutely nothing valuable in my car, nor did I have anything in my car out in plain sight besides my fold up massage table (I'm an esthetician) The motive was strange; as he made a lot of noise and drew attention to himself.

This is just a warning, it happened to another neighbor in the same building. Make sure you don't leave valuables inside your car- break ins are happening left and right. I spent my entire Saturday getting the window fixed. I have reported this information to the police.

Description of person involved ‚Äì Hair: short dark hair, Top: red windbreaker, Bottom: jeans, Age: mid 30s? Early 40s?, Sex: MaleMy sons and several other cars were broken in a couple of weeks ago.
It's getting so bad :( And my only option is street parking so who's to say it won't happen again?
Just make sure all valuables are out of car. I hope it doesn't happen again.
That is disturbing. I just moved into the neighborhood and love it! I won‚Äôt let the thugs push me out. I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you.
I live on colfax with a lot of foot traffic, especially from the homeless as well. I have multiple problems in this neighborhood quite frequently but I assume it also is partially due to living on a Main Street. I will be leaving this neighborhood though once my lease is over. I can‚Äôt take it anymore :(
Brittany Hagood I understand. I hope wherever you move it ends up being a great space for you. Take care of yourself

Are there any non singing service projects in the Denver area where 5-6 of us at a time can help with? 

For example we are making Origami Boxes for a group that honors those who have passed of gun violence, this is through the church we hold our rehearsals at.

Yes, especially when the weather gets better and you go to buildings with balconies so people can come out to hear you sing....and starting with any place that has senior citizens living there.  I would be glad to ride around my neighborhood and provide you with the addresses of all buildings I see with balconies.
No service projects, but just wanted to give a shout out to the Denver Gay Men's Chorus. Was fortunate to see a performance and what an amazingly talented group! Hope the current crisis doesn't impact the group's future too much.(edited)

I think Urban Peak might be able to find a project for you in their work with homeless youth.
Could you stand outside far apart and sing for the residents at Kavod?
I would love for your members to consider volunteering at St. Francis Center, a daytime shelter for the homeless. I volunteer on Thursday mornings and I love it. Due to my age (73), my family asked me to put this on pause for the duration of this crisis. Additionally SFC has asked volunteers 60 and over not to volunteer at this time. And that‚Äôs a lot of us.

You can always donate to a legitimate charity such as Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, Denver Rescue Mission, ARC, Salvation Army, American Red Cross.

There are some young people who are out of abusive homes, maybe even underage runaways, that get recruited into outfits that promise them a decent room & money for working but then, of course, they're taken to a strange city and exploited. If reports of them become more common again (like they were years ago) then posting about the occurrences here might help to determine if police need to be notified.
It really magazine sale is a scam.I looked into it a couple of years ago because I am a sucker for wanting to help kids out.  I subscribed to different magazines-- with a couple different solicitors.  I never saw a magazine.  Its my understanding that there is some sham company that contract with these kids to go door to door.  They meet at a location,  a van drops them off in neighborhoods and then herds them all back in the van.  The kids get an hourly rate + a small bonus if they meet a certain goal.  What I have learned =-- I tell phone and door-to-door solicitors that I do not donate or pay $ for anything without  making sure they are legit but they can leave their info..
I realized that I brought up underage runaways as an emotional appeal argument but even though that possibility exists there is also the possibility that a person doing that could be classified as an 'at-risk' adult and caught up in a crew that's organized to some degree. If any of the people that are doing this have ever been diagnosed with mental illness by a psychiatrist then they would be in the category of vulnerable or 'at-risk' adult. (That actually becomes more likely when taking into account the push for ADHD diagnoses with the younger generation.) People in that demographic are historically marginalized and in turn are part of a defined minority class. Some people are easily taken advantage of and there may be other motivating factors.

Drop all of the Bravo Sierra about rentals and stats. I don't want to live  next door to a frat house with booze bottles and cigarettes butts all over their property and mine, never being able to park near my home again and people coming and going all night long waking me up. That is what the rental next to me was before it went back to a single family owner AND that was before you could have 30 people living there legally.
Is your home in a 90% rental area for say a quarter mile radius?
Christopher Neuman I have no idea. That doesn't matter. If this zoning passes Denver will turn into a giant slum, every where.
The reality is law enforcement can not enforce what is in place now. They will not pursue a Vehicle hit and run when you provide them with the license plate.

Allison, the cafe menu changes daily and currently they offer a choice between 2 mains (one vegetarian), a side salad, bread and tea/coffee.  You do not need to order in advance and yes they have no-contact pick-up.  You can view the menu at https://www.soallmayeat.org/menu.

Thanks for the reminder!
I just dropped off 25 fabric face masks for their volunteers.  (My friend is on the Board of Directors and volunteers there 3 days a week).  She said they need many more masks because besides providing masks for their volunteers, they also give them away to the homeless so if you are a sewer, have a machine and can make masks, please consider donating them to this wonderful place.  If you need fabric, elastic, wire or a pattern, please PM me and I can supply everything for free.(edited)
Wish I knew how to sew! What about the bandana masks?

They are serving healthy, hot lunch outside the cafe M-F 11a-230pm, and sack lunch (2)sandwiches on Saturday - for free or a donation of any amount.  Please share this information with anyone you know who may be facing food insecurity.  
Also thanks to my employer, CookStreet School of Culinary Arts for their generous donation of food, equipment and kitchen space.  Today I made 43 dozen cookies for SAME in the Cookstreet kitchen so the SAME staff could maintain physical distance with food prep in their own small kitchen.  Just yet another story of people helping people to get us through these times.  Stay well.Wonderful!! Thank you for your contribution.
Holed up in winter park, but will support when I return. SAME changes life. Hang in there
Amazing work!
Great folks and food!
Wow so cool they got to stay open! Love this place!
SAME Cafe also has the BEST gluten free food including pizza
love SAME!!  way to go people!!
Do they take volunteers?  Or anyone know of somewhere that does or wants an extra hand?
They are taking a limited number of volunteers at this time.  You can reach out via the website soallmayeat.org.   They are also accepting donations and specific requests usually come through their facebook page.  Thanks so much for your interest.
I love this place üòä they do such amazing work
The SAME is super!
Great food and a GREAT way to help those who struggle with finding a decent meal.   üôÇüôÇ
I have never been here!  Thanks for the info!  Do you know if you can do no-contact pickup?  Just like order to go and pickup outside the cafe?  Thanks!
Allison, the cafe menu changes daily and currently they offer a choice between 2 mains (one vegetarian), a side salad, bread and tea/coffee.  You do not need to order in advance and yes they have no-contact pick-up.  You can view the menu at https://www.soallmayeat.org/menu.  They are open 11a-230p M-F and Sat handing out sack lunches during the same times.  Thanks for your interest!  Oh -and a yummy sugar cookie!
Thanks for the reminder!
I just dropped off 25 fabric face masks for their volunteers.  (My friend is on the Board of Directors and volunteers there 3 days a week).  She said they need many more masks because besides providing masks for their volunteers, they also give them away to the homeless so if you are a sewer, have a machine and can make masks, please consider donating them to this wonderful place.  If you need fabric, elastic, wire or a pattern, please PM me and I can supply everything for free.(edited)
Wish I knew how to sew! What about the bandana masks?
Barb, 43 DOZEN? WTG neighbor
thanks Jeanne.  They are going through about 40 dozen cookies every 4 days - so guess what I am doing tomorrow!(edited)
That‚Äôs some sweet self control right there. I might only deliver 38 dozen üòã
That made me smile üåù
Wondering, when it comes to the type of mask (whether ties or elastic around ears) what's better for homeless folks?

A Judge said it was un constitutional to ban camping..Yes, we voted no on camping but some judge thinks he can do what ever he wants to...We need to get his name and make sure he is not re elected as a judge.
Indeed we need that judge's name.
That‚Äôs fantastic!!!
Probably all of us should contact the mayor and council and ask what the plan is for helping the homeless into something permanent. Where is the funding--or are they planning to create a ballot measure to create a new dedicated source of funding. What is being done to create affordable housing and to expand wrap around services?  This is the minimum those of us who opposed the repeal of the camping ban said we thought would be a better solution to allowing camping.(edited)

Rat infestation is the cause:
not just rats, but rats with the plague!
Kate We you‚Äôre right, i misread the article - not yet confirmed
Wow! How about a little compassion? My partner and I live paycheck to paycheck. If either of us loses our job we could be those people most of you hate. And before you say it, shelters are not safe for queer people. The problem isn‚Äôt these people it‚Äôs a city that only seems to value wealth.
The problem is lack of decent wages, accessible healthcare, affordable housing and adequate mental health care services. NONE of these will be addressed when you have masses of people living on city streets. Allowing ""city camping"" is basically allowing people to live in squalor at levels dangerous to the environment and to the local communities. Locking people up isn't the answer. But neither is allowing people to turn local streets and parks into slums and cardboard/tent cities.
Glad your working most homeless do not want to or are too mentally I'll to work
Just saw the news segment. That‚Äôs great news to get the mess and trash cleaned up. The city should make designated camp areas that aren‚Äôt near sidewalks, businesses, parks and homes. A safe area that has a portable bathroom.
Jennie, many of us are compassionate.  One of my sisters had 5 kids of which the two oldest are gay and I love them dearly!  I do think it is up to the city to come up with a more permanent plan to house the homeless especially those with mental illness and families who can't afford to live here.  However, I do not want a homeless camp living in front of my house on my ""hell strip"".
What does loving your family members who are gay have to do with being compassionate?
And I don't I don't hate you or others in that situation.  I think many of us don't value wealth.  I surely am not wealthy.  I worked very hard for the 789 sq foot home that the bank and I own.
Removing the homeless from your sight doesn‚Äôt get solve the problem, it just forces it onto someone else. The city won‚Äôt do anything as long as Hancock & his cronies are in office.(edited)
I agree Jennie. Understanding the homeless is such a complicated issue. We will never home every homeless person because of mental illness and self-choice. We can provide programs and transitional housing along with education and job assistance. It depends on how the money is spent, and that is the problem.

I do believe that we have a homeless problem and the city is trying to alleviate this problem. But do we want to be Portland or San Francisco with tents everywhere? I don't think so. Building 30 tiny houses will not alleviate this problem! I don't want tents in City Park or on our parkways. I hope they can find a job or get mental illness help.

They closed Lincoln Park in Downtown Denver because of rat infestation, human and animal waste, drug paraphernalia and food waste. It's just not safe! Do you want to be LA, San Fran, Portland..I say no!!!
There is no rat infestation. It is literally just an age old tactic to dehumanize folx and displace them in spite of it being unconstitutional.
We will end up like San Francisvo at this rate.
Has it gotten worse this week or better? About to go for a run around park now
this is why we voted no on 300. not sure why one judge got to overturn that
A judge found the camping ban unconstitutional.  It's still the law and has not been overturned.  Finding a law unconstitutional  makes the issue become a civil rights issue that will likely be litigated.  Prop 300 didn't pass, so it can't be overturned.
It was a county judge. Further, the judge did not issue an injunction stopping the city, but made a decision  based on very narrow facts of one ticket. And even if the judge DID try to issue an injunction, county judges have  no such authority. The city used that one, very  minor decision, as an  excuse to stop enforcement. Until the health hazards became too much to ignore.
It‚Äôs a bad look when the best thing a community feels it can do for its most vulnerable is declare them criminals and lock them up.

Sadly, I don't think anyone who is doing this would read this and think, ""Oh wow! My dog could be cold? Maybe I should bring it in!"" It's awful but if anyone knows of this happening, call 311 with address and if you can take video (or picture) it really helps prove they left their animals out in freezing temps. I will say, I reported this with all of the above when someone left their dog out in negative temps a few years ago. The dog was out for about 12hrs and when the Animal Protection Officer arrived they denied it and that was that. And as unfair as it is, apparently if the animal has access to a covered area (in this case an awning) and water (not frozen) it's legal :( Disgusting!
Heather, I had similar experience a few yrs, back. I arrived home at 5 p,m. It was -14. The dogs across the street were outside and barking. I put a note on their door and said if they were not there within 15 minutes that I was calling animal control. Fortunately they came home and let the dogs in. I believe they're at work all day.
They can say anything.  Those who find out what's going on will ignore said sayings.
The people who left their dogs out in that kind of weather were""nuts""! People like that don't deserve to have dogs!
Jana, And some people don't deserve to have children. It happens all the time.

","Freezing temps. Please everyone...bring your furr babies in.  Remember if you‚Äôre cold...they‚Äôre cold!  
Thanks on behalf of the furr babies!!Yes yes its cold for them especially tonight........mybaby beagle is a senior dog when its this cold she is trained for pee pads.......its safer for her and me too!!!!
Thanks Lynn for the reminder!  I don't let my inside cats out, but I feed a feral cat colony and I have ""dog"" houses in my back yard for them with plenty of wool blankets!  They are fed well with fresh water and are healthy and happy!  Please make sure your own pets are in the same condition!
Awesome!  Thank you for feeding those outdoor babies & keeping them safe.  I have 11 super spoiled indoor cats.  I do feed & water a couple of cats that visit as well as squirrels & a family of mice.  I know ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù. üòÅüêøüêÄüêà
One of my neighbors, I can‚Äôt tell who, has left their dog out for around 2 hours TONIGHT, I can tell by the barking on our security camera but not sure what I can do about it. I‚Äôve reported them before, obviously nothing has become of it, they continue to do it.(edited)
Report again!!

Kacy is a German Shepherd and Kandy is a poodle small they are inside pets we love them so much, I take them out and stay till  finish their business, thanks for reminding.
Tracy, I don't know if you are calling Denver Animal Control, but the Denver Dumb Friends League also has a number to report these types of issues.  Unfortunately, I have had to call them way too many times over the years.  üò≠  Thank you for keeping an eye out.  It is supposed to be 5 degrees tonight!  Too cold for ""man"" or beast.
Yes please call DDFLthey will help get these pets inside...its just too cold do this now please.please call they helped me a few yrs back ....this dog was being dragged by a drunk homeless man .....they rescued the dog ....it went into investgations ..i kept in close contact with the main head guy of the DDFL...the man was no longer allowed pets of any kind....the puppy dog got shots and spay and adopted to a family in the country with a yard. And loving family....they renamed him Charlie puppy..happy ending.....good life...
Thank you Pat!!!  üêïüêà‚ù§üòä
Sadly, I don't think anyone who is doing this would read this and think, ""Oh wow! My dog could be cold? Maybe I should bring it in!"" It's awful but if anyone knows of this happening, call 311 with address and if you can take video (or picture) it really helps prove they left their animals out in freezing temps. I will say, I reported this with all of the above when someone left their dog out in negative temps a few years ago. The dog was out for about 12hrs and when the Animal Protection Officer arrived they denied it and that was that. And as unfair as it is, apparently if the animal has access to a covered area (in this case an awning) and water (not frozen) it's legal :( Disgusting!
Heather, I had similar experience a few yrs, back. I arrived home at 5 p,m. It was -14. The dogs across the street were outside and barking. I put a note on their door and said if they were not there within 15 minutes that I was calling animal control. Fortunately they came home and let the dogs in. I believe they're at work all day.
They can say anything.  Those who find out what's going on will ignore said sayings.
The people who left their dogs out in that kind of weather were""nuts""! People like that don't deserve to have dogs!
Jana, And some people don't deserve to have children. It happens all the time.
I think the folks that leave their pets outside should be given a taste of their own medicine.

Recreative on Santa Fe is a good choice.  The Gathering Place on Colfax & High St. also has a knitting class for their members (women seeking to transition out of homelessness)

It is called Knitting for Peace
Knitting For Peace located at 2600 Leyden Street in the Park Hill UCC Church. They donate items to the homeless, to newborns, etc. It's a wonderful non-profit which creates knit and crocheted blankets, washcloths, hats, scarves, socks, etc.
That's the group that my friend knits for! I couldn't remember the name.

220,364,364,146898852,Philip Rutherford,Congress Park,3 May 20,"Very concerned about the UPS store 700 Colo. Blvd. OK, I know not everyone's concerned about this whole COVID-19 thing, but for those who are at least trying to observe the very basic suggestions on social distancing, I'd like to give you a heads-up on one of our local businesses. I'm 76 so I pretty much need to observe.  I just dropped off a UPS return at the store on 700 Colo. Blvd.  I saw that an extreme minimum of the distancing guidelines are being observed there. The lobby is very small so there's an absolute minimum of space for 6' distancing, clerks are not wearing masks and there are no other forms of barriers, and, a steady stream of observing and non-observing customers are coming in one after the other.  This caught my attention because I've been to many other local businesses that are doing a good job of keeping their customers safe and it's much appreciated.  In those stores, you can at least assume that they try to clean and disinfect regularly.  However, in this UPS store, I got no such feeling and they deal with a lot of customers each day.  My recommendation is that if you need to ship, that you shop around for other UPS stores locally that observe a higher level of citizenship toward their customers",concerned store know concerned covid-19 thing try observe basic suggestion social distancing like head local business pretty need observe drop return store see extreme minimum distance guideline observe lobby small absolute minimum space distancing clerk wear mask form barrier steady stream observe non - observe customer come catch attention local business good job keep customer safe appreciate store assume try clean disinfect regularly store get feeling deal lot customer day recommendation need ship shop store locally observe high level citizenship customer,"They don‚Äôt provide masks for their drivers either
I believe the UPS stores are independently owned. Try the store in the shopping center on 1st and University. It‚Äôs the same shopping center as Christy Sports.
Property owners restricted hallway access so that you can only use one door.  I‚Äôve gone there several times since the start and you are 100% correct masks are not being provided.  
FWIW, I usually take any packing air bubbles I get to them for re-use and they are not currently accepting them due to covid fears.  I understand they have a small space but they really need to provide their workers with masks! O.o
You should call 311 if you want to effect the enforcement of change
There is a  shop at Lowry where The owner is very careful but also very helpful. 
That UPS store was peculiar before COVID.  I went in there one sunday and there were scented candles burning, the lights were low, and slow jams a la Teddy Pendergrass were playing through the speakers.  I felt like I was intruding, largely because it was generously implied by the people behind the counter that I was.  So I'm unsurprised that they're not complying with COVID / social distancing / etc.  The one on University is doing nicely and as far as I know no one's getting ready to get their groove on during business hours.
I was just at UPS at 700 Colorado Blv (10:30 am Monday 4th).  They are limiting access to 3 people at a time in the store - they have 3 stations so that means there is no waiting in line IN the store.  They have floor marked 6' apart between each station as well as from the station counter.  All employees are wearing masks.
I agree. I was there last Thursday and i had to wait my turn outside on an X, and staff were wearing masks and we had to stand on the X as they were helping us.
I concur, and customer flow is one way, in though the front door and out the back.  I was just there at 12pm today and felt very comfortable with what they were doing.  Maybe this post worked?
On a related note I was on a Saturday walk at City Park and noticed multiple groups of people without masks. Also the Porta-Potty was open and used by three consecutive people (including a pregnant woman) within minutes. I often wonder about the surfaces...
The porta potties really need to stay open, as people still need to pee, especially homeless folks who have even fewer places to go nowadays since so many places are closed.  And pregnant ladies need to pee *often*. ;)  However I'd hope that they put in a handwashing station along with it - porta potty companies offer those, but they're not often actually used.  Maybe call P&R and ask them to include handwashing stations if you didn't see one.
The UPS Store next to Home Depot off Quebec was practicing safe measures with masks and distancing. Try that one instead.
There are hand washing stations by the portapotties in Cheesman Park.
I went there today. Yes, not the most organized or cleanest, but they put my package together.....gave me a receipt and I was out the door before I knew what was happening. Quick and efficient. 
How about just not going someplace you aren‚Äôt comfortable with rather than trashing them. If it doesn‚Äôt feel good to you, simply go elsewhere. They don‚Äôt owe you anything other than the their service. I have always had great service there.
I was at this UPS store on Sunday (next door to Snooze). They have a 3-customer maximum inside and mask requirements, even the clerks were wearing masks. Then outside, everyone was standing 6' apart in line to get in. This was my experience.
This will become less of an issue tomorrow: https://www.denverpost.com/2020/05/01/denver-hancock-coronavirus-face-masks/(edited)
I go in there a lot, and the floor is marked with tape for social distancing 6 feet. :)
Yeah, the problem isn't the store, it's the people not practicing proper social distancing.  If you are concerned about your proximity to other people, there are plenty of ship from home / scheduled pick-up options available.  I have been in that store, and they are making very reasonable efforts to comply with the recommendations.
I've been there several times since the quarantine began (needed a notary and to ship stuff).  I found the staff to be diligent about maintaining social distancing.  The bigger problem is they are getting slammed with customers and are not always able to stop customers before they get in (however, I have seen them send people back outside).  I'm sorry that you had a bad experience when you went, but I felt like I should let you know I have have the opposite experience.
Oh great, I have to go tomorrow to return an Amazon purchase.  My daughter works at a UPS Store in another state.  They are provided masks, shields and gloves.

He JUST parked in front of our house this AM and now his engine is smoking. We were planning to call 311 after 72 hours.
I called 311 last week and all the normal ways of reporting ended in ‚Äúno service‚Äù.
I guess I don't understand what's happening - are they parking there and then not moving for months?
Not for months in one place.  Maybe a week in one place then move down the block and stay another week.  This continues because the city won‚Äôt enforce the parking laws.  I had one of them come into my yard and plug their motorhome into my outdoor electrical outlet.
I had an abandoned Jeep in front of my house for a few weeks several years ago.  I mentioned it to the parking ticket people when they were going around for street sweeping, it was gone within 2 hours.  Sometimes a casual conversation with the ticket issuers speed things along...
I just looked up the street sweeping schedule on the Denver site and they are no longer ticketing and towing, which is the root cause of all this.  It‚Äôs going to get really bad this summer with no enforcement.
It could be worse...tons of Curtis Park neighbors are objecting to this in front of their homes, long before the Covid 19 virus.(edited)
I hear you, but I certainly am not posting this so we can all just get comfortable with it.
Maybe it's someone that lost thier home because of all of this. Maybe someone was lucky enough to keep thier job, but have lost thier housing. 
That's a really thoughtful point, Amy. I appreciate you for adding to the conversation. I've never been homeless but I think of things like what you presented fairly often as I see these camps around town. The guy who posted said he did originally communicate directly. I agree, person to person comm, if done safely, is totally useful for initial & respectful contact but beyond that, I'd call the city too...they're strangers on his property stealing electricity. Still, certainly feel sad for folks doing such things to survive because no one wants to live that way but that's what comes of a country suffering from severe wealth inequality.(edited)
And the Moho keeps moving around our block, isn‚Äôt registered, parking illegally, and connecting power to peoples property while every day there are reports of break ins and stolen bikes.  I have lots of empathy but doing this is not ok.
Chad, it's unfair to assume this motor home person is the culprit in the break ins"" and stolen bikes. That is, unless you saw it happen. 
All parking enforcement laws are suspended in the city till may 31.  That includes 72 hr abandoned vehicle towing and 24 hour 22' or longer rig towing.
But if Matthew McConaughey came waltzing out of this I‚Äôd say JACKPOT!
From BRUN, Berkeley NRO:
Beginning July 1 and until further notice: Enforcement of posted parking restrictions for street and enforcement of 72-hour parking limits will resume. This was paused for COVID. https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/covid-19/recovery-guidance/transportation-parking.html(edited)

Maybe it's someone that lost thier home because of all of this. Maybe someone was lucky enough to keep thier job, but have lost thier housing. 
That's a really thoughtful point, Amy. I appreciate you for adding to the conversation. I've never been homeless but I think of things like what you presented fairly often as I see these camps around town. The guy who posted said he did originally communicate directly. I agree, person to person comm, if done safely, is totally useful for initial & respectful contact but beyond that, I'd call the city too...they're strangers on his property stealing electricity. Still, certainly feel sad for folks doing such things to survive because no one wants to live that way but that's what comes of a country suffering from severe wealth inequality.(edited)
And the Moho keeps moving around our block, isn‚Äôt registered, parking illegally, and connecting power to peoples property while every day there are reports of break ins and stolen bikes.  I have lots of empathy but doing this is not ok.
Chad, it's unfair to assume this motor home person is the culprit in the break ins"" and stolen bikes. That is, unless you saw it happen. 
All parking enforcement laws are suspended in the city till may 31.  That includes 72 hr abandoned vehicle towing and 24 hour 22' or longer rig towing.
But if Matthew McConaughey came waltzing out of this I‚Äôd say JACKPOT!

It is parked well past the 72 hour ordinance limit. You can call 311 with the plate, make model and location. Or the abandoned vehicle hotline. Enforcement will come mark their location and if it is still there in another 72 hours, they will be issued a ticket. Small consolation.(edited)

Go ride by. Assuming you filed a police report it's probable cause for them to at least search the van.
Thanks so much for letting us know, John.  My dog died in December and I'm not getting out as much as I used to and this is one block from my home.  They're in our hood a lot of the time and lived in our parking lot for two summers until the new owners finally chased them out.

Is there a Santa Cruz mountain bike on the back?!?
Stolen from my garage yesterday on Cook and 17
Have you notified police?
He has left the location.  No clue where he is now.
It's interesting to watch human behavior on this forum. Why didn't someone at least get a plate/tag number so others may go in search of this vehicle, or contact the non-emergency number for the police? Why do some people wait for someone else to SPEAK UP? Nothing even has a chance to change if it is not reported to the proper authorities. IMHO.
Em, we have been at this for more than a year.
If you do a search for ""white van"" there are many posts about this van. I can't tell by this latest picture, but if they still have the same temporary tags someone posted this number on one of those posts - 253723.
How do they keep having temporary plates?
When police ticket a car with temporary tags, there is no link to database that shows it has received previous tickets.  So it will not be towed. Channel 7, John Ferrugia, did a great story on this several years ago.
PEOPLE... when you see this van, and I mean the very first day, you MUST CALL the police non-emergency number. I can't stress this enough. The officer I spoke with last put this van on their nightly patrol checklist and they seemed to be gone for some time. The fact that they've removed the Redneck sticker is a very big deal.
Thank you for this, I'll update with a new post, but I'm gonna 311 as I got a picture of their new location just now.
311 is not the police non-emergency number so not sure it will result in anything. The non-emergency number is 720-913-2000 if that is who you were trying to reach.
UPDATE: Sgt James Lucero (District 6) has been updated on this situation. He said another neighbor had already been in touch. They will add the van back to their regular patrol list.
Thanks so much for doing that. If others on this thread could do the same, it would be very helpful!
Spotted him at park and Colfax 12:40 pm and has been reported
Thanks for taking the time to make a report!
...fighting fire with fire would be...bad...right?
Has there been a documented crime committed by these folks reported to the authorities? Besides the expired plates...?(edited)
The police are well aware that this group is stealing, parting/selling bikes. They have also been seen selling drugs. If you are going to assert that these folks are being falsely accused or that we should somehow offer them pity or assistance, please stop posting here. They are not innocent. And they are using teenagers and drug addicts to help them take care of this business. Many of us have been working to get rid of these criminals for more than a year.

Oh brother!
When my sister and I were little kids..our Mom and her older sister ""messed"" around with a Ouija board when my dad and uncle worked nights or were out of town. I was too young to remember what happened other than we fled from the house one night during a 'session'. To this day my sis and mom will not discuss it and my aunt carried it to her grave. I do remember watching the planchette fly around the board..and the Ouija board was never brought out again.(edited)
The same thing happened to me after my husband died.  My sister and I were playing with it trying to talk to him and something evil came out of it and started saying really scary things.  We threw that board into the fire place and burned it up.(edited)
Much more empowering than what?  Giving a person power?  Why anyone would choose darkness over light in search of power is a mystery, indeed...(edited)

No responsible loving parent will never lead their child to the dark and dangerous side of evil. Shame on you Robin and other parents thanking this is entertainment on using a board.

TIA :)",seafood restaurant recommendation husband move area miss crab recommendation seafood restaurant area,"Jax's fish house and blue island oyster bar, town and country market produce has great fresh alaskan salmon and other fish if you looking to cook
I highly recommend the crawling crab. It's absolutely delicious and very affordable.  A similar concept restaurant just opened in Stapleton called Hook and Reel, it's a bit more expensive and wasn't quite as good.  Was still good though.
Hook and Reel Cajun is not good depending on what you order, try for yourself, I think comparing from where you came from you will be sorely disappointed.
Stoic & Genuine, Fish N Beer, Humboldt Farm Fish & Wine
Stoic & Genuine!! They fly their seafood in fresh daily üôåüèº
Fresh Fish company  on Hampden has been around for years, and for good reason.  Fresh flown in daily. And great San Francisco sourdough bread.  It's a temptation to OD on the bread, but try not to do that or you'll never get to the seafood.
Birthday brunch percentage off by age. Quit serving crab with brunch you have to order separately but still a discount on your birthday however old you are, must make a reservation or wait forever.
üòÄ
Grew up in that area, Fairfax. You will not find anything close to blue crab out here. I‚Äôve had blue crab overnighted from Lintons Seafood from MD. A bit pricey but totally worth it.
This. From Silver Spring. Best is to get some lump crabmeat and make your own. Everything here has fillers.
Grew up in Bethesda and I have picky tastes when it comes to seafood (particularly oysters). by far the best seafood I‚Äôve had in Denver is Fish & Beer. Only place out here that can properly shuck an oyster and all their food is amazing. It‚Äôs a restaurant that you could easily see being really successful in Georgetown or on U Street. 
JAX is our favorite seafood place
Has anyone tried Hook and Reel Cajun yet?? Think it is it opened by Walmart and Home Depot off Smith road...I haven‚Äôt tried it yet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yes, have you ever been to crawling crab?  Hook and reel is a similar concept,  the food is decent.  Not really good in comparison to crawling crab.  Also a bit more expensive.
Such a great to try list. Thanks all!
I second Stoic & Genuine at Union Station!
Blue Oyster in cc
Blue Island Oyster Bar in cherry Creek is incredible. They are a locally owned business and own an oyster farm on the Atlantic coast that they fly oysters in from daily. Their food is delicious
I am from Maryland and I haven‚Äôt found anything crab cake-wise that holds up to Faidley‚Äôs in Baltimore. There are several places that ship or you can bring back crab cakes on dry ice. Oysters are decent at the places mentioned. I was liking Mario‚Äôs Ocean Club on Broadway but they went under. 
My friend lives in the Baltimore suburbs - we would always get pappas crabcakes.  Those were huge and delicious
I think the crabcakes at The Officer's Club in Lowry come close.  We lived 20 years in DC.
Stoic and Genuine and Fish and Beer.  I'm an east coaster too!
Sorry but you will find nothing like them around here. New Orleans or Florida. I had the best salmon in DC, I wanted to ask restaurant for recipe, no chance right, blue crab yum. If you find some. please let us know. Thanks.

","seafood restaurant recommendations. My husband and I moved here from the DC/VA area, and I'm missing some of those Maryland crabs!  What are your recommendations for seafood restaurants here in Denver area???

TIA :)Jax's fish house and blue island oyster bar, town and country market produce has great fresh alaskan salmon and other fish if you looking to cook
I highly recommend the crawling crab. It's absolutely delicious and very affordable.  A similar concept restaurant just opened in Stapleton called Hook and Reel, it's a bit more expensive and wasn't quite as good.  Was still good though.
Hook and Reel Cajun is not good depending on what you order, try for yourself, I think comparing from where you came from you will be sorely disappointed.
Stoic & Genuine, Fish N Beer, Humboldt Farm Fish & Wine
Stoic & Genuine!! They fly their seafood in fresh daily üôåüèº
Fresh Fish company  on Hampden has been around for years, and for good reason.  Fresh flown in daily. And great San Francisco sourdough bread.  It's a temptation to OD on the bread, but try not to do that or you'll never get to the seafood.
Birthday brunch percentage off by age. Quit serving crab with brunch you have to order separately but still a discount on your birthday however old you are, must make a reservation or wait forever.
üòÄ
Grew up in that area, Fairfax. You will not find anything close to blue crab out here. I‚Äôve had blue crab overnighted from Lintons Seafood from MD. A bit pricey but totally worth it.
This. From Silver Spring. Best is to get some lump crabmeat and make your own. Everything here has fillers.
Grew up in Bethesda and I have picky tastes when it comes to seafood (particularly oysters). by far the best seafood I‚Äôve had in Denver is Fish & Beer. Only place out here that can properly shuck an oyster and all their food is amazing. It‚Äôs a restaurant that you could easily see being really successful in Georgetown or on U Street. 
JAX is our favorite seafood place
Has anyone tried Hook and Reel Cajun yet?? Think it is it opened by Walmart and Home Depot off Smith road...I haven‚Äôt tried it yet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yes, have you ever been to crawling crab?  Hook and reel is a similar concept,  the food is decent.  Not really good in comparison to crawling crab.  Also a bit more expensive.
Such a great to try list. Thanks all!
I second Stoic & Genuine at Union Station!

This makes no sense at all.
Brick and mortar retails stores are already struggling so not sure of their logic to do away with 1hr parking. Macy‚Äôs and others are definitely struggling
Oh and I love how they commandeered the once public road of cherry creek north between university and Steele!!!
My goal every time I go is to get in and out in that first hour
Super lame. Only time I go there anymore is to the movie theater. And they validate!
I think the goal is to keep the 
Movie theater coming to 9th and Colorado Boulevard soon, and I am told free parking, so soon no reason at all to go to that mall
I heard they implemented the paid parking because construction workers were using there parking lots and they wanted to put an end to that?  Not sure if that‚Äôs true?  I do think we need to support the shopping mall.  I can walk there so I don‚Äôt have to worry about paying for parking though.
Just doesn't bother me..... there are to many big things in life to worry about other than parking. For anybody that doesn't agree with the fee, we certainly have a great alternative to drive to Park Meadows and shop. Great shops down there too.  Lots of alternatives....
I‚Äôm told that the paid parking brings in $4 million per year to the mall owners. The individual shops are not happy either.
My understanding is that there are several reasons for charging at the CC mall, including people parking there and taking the bus or biking downtown as well as people living in condos nearby without sufficient parking would park at the mall leaving less spots available for people shopping there.  It doesn't make sense that they will no longer offer 1 hour free
That was the original reason(excuse), but why eliminate the one hour grace period? I don‚Äôt get it...üòê
I stopped shopping there when the started the pay parking. I am very happy about my decision. Yes, boycott the mall(edited)

The age of the congregation probably skews more towards older but I think there are more younger people recently than in the past so this may be shifting.
Augustana Lutheran Church ( 5000 E. Alameda) is a very welcoming congregation with two female pastors, an active youth group and  I believe a welcoming congregation ( I‚Äôve been a member a long time, let me know if that isn‚Äôt true.). Services are 8;30 AM in the chapel ( upper level of the south building)  and In the main sanctuary at 10:30.   Sunday School classes are in the South building and  there is also an adult forum there with a variety of speakers/ discussion topics, etc.  A coffee/fellowship time is between services in the lower level of the main building , 10;00 to 10:30.

St. John‚Äôs Episcopal Cathedral. LBGT, female, and African American clergy and leadership. Beautiful music (traditional) lots of kids, many different activities and a mission to help the homeless. It may look Roman Catholic when you walk in but pretty much opposite end of political spectrum. They welcome inquirers and those from other faith traditions. If you are interested in a smaller, more intimate setting there are at least four small Episcopal parishes within a mile.
I second Ellen Reath's recommendation of Montview Presbyterian Church. The congregation is a good mix of young families as well as older members. Also has an awesome Minister of Music. In one service, the music can range from Plainchant to Dave Brubeck. Montview has a vibrant children and youth involvement, and is a More Light Presbyterian church, which works ""for the full  participation of LGBTQIA+ people in the life, ministry, and witness of the Presbyterian Church (USA)."" Montview is also a designated Sanctuary church for undocumented immigrants. Check it out at montview.org!

St. John‚Äôs Episcopal Cathedral. LBGT, female, and African American clergy and leadership. Beautiful music (traditional) lots of kids, many different activities and a mission to help the homeless. It may look Roman Catholic when you walk in but pretty much opposite end of political spectrum. They welcome inquirers and those from other faith traditions. If you are interested in a smaller, more intimate setting there are at least four small Episcopal parishes within a mile.
I second Ellen Reath's recommendation of Montview Presbyterian Church. The congregation is a good mix of young families as well as older members. Also has an awesome Minister of Music. In one service, the music can range from Plainchant to Dave Brubeck. Montview has a vibrant children and youth involvement, and is a More Light Presbyterian church, which works ""for the full  participation of LGBTQIA+ people in the life, ministry, and witness of the Presbyterian Church (USA)."" Montview is also a designated Sanctuary church for undocumented immigrants. Check it out at montview.org!

Christmas is a Christian holiday - not everyone is Christian.  I imagine this wording (i.e., Seasons Greetings, Peace, Joy and Happiness) was chosen because it addresses *everyone* living in Denver.

From Gail Skyes, with permission. To
City Council members, Mayor Hancock and Andrew Webb,

I listened to Wednesday‚Äôs presentation by Andrew Webb regarding the recommended changes to Denver‚Äôs Group Living Zoning, and I want to express my strong concerns and opposition to what is happening.   

The Committee has lumped together so many major changes in to this proposal that citizens cannot intelligently consider what the overall impact will be to our city. 

The Committee says new zoning regulations will ‚Äúsimplify‚Äù the Zoning code for the city. This is blatantly untrue.  It will, in fact, create a quagmire for citizens and make it impossible for us to address our neighborhood‚Äôs needs. 

The proposed zoning changes push enforcement and monitoring of zoning regulations on to the citizens while absolving the city zoning agencies of any responsibility for the effects of the changes.  Citizens have been told we can call 311 or the police for help on violations. 

What involved citizens are hearing and being sensitive to is what affects them - not the holistic body of changes being proposed and what this re-zoning proposal ultimately means for our communities.   

Some people are concerned that the current definition of unrelated adults and their families is discriminatory to the LGBTQ community and that it does not recognize current societal norms or desire for communal living. 
They support the zoning proposal.

Older people are threatened by all of the changes at once, particularly with all of the neighborhood issues we are already facing each and every day, without government support.
They do not support the zoning proposal.

Homeowners and neighborhood communities are rightfully concerned about overcrowding, residential care facilities, homeless shelters, and prison facilities in the neighborhoods without clear and defined rules regarding density, proximity to schools and community gathering places , 
They do not support the recommended changes. 

Many people support pieces of the bill, but we cannot currently consider or support them separately.  I believe this is exactly what the special interests driving this initiative want - chaos, ignorance and apathy that will ensure approval of their initiative without allowing citizens to address each piece intelligently. This feels very much like what is happening to citizens on a national level, and is flat out wrong. 

The ‚Äúdata‚Äù, as we are consistently hearing from the Committee, is that it's good (!) for our neighborhoods  to encourage:  Severe overcrowding of single family residences without bathroom or minimum square footage requirements; unregulated and unlicensed halfway houses, residential care, nursing, rehab and correctional facilities without regard for children and home owners‚Äô well being; and expanded congregate living (rent by the room).  

Let me simplify - the Committee is paving the way for:  overcrowding of neighborhoods and public services for the enrichment of landlords and real estate speculators, profiting by private investors for the unregulated care of our most vulnerable citizens needing nursing and rehabilitation services, price gouging and profiting by investors of private prison expansion (that WE tax payers will also be paying for) and, of course,  Air B&B. 

And for all of this ‚Äúprogress‚Äù under the guise of ‚Äúaffordable housing and helping the homeless‚Äù,  we tax payers and citizens who have built these desirable neighborhoods to live in get to monitor and deal with the inevitable abuses and problems that will result. 

A selling point for the Committee is that  Seattle, Portland, Washington DC and other cities have this progressive model in place and it‚Äôs the way to go for Denver.  This conclusion is based on naivety and / or stupidity. Denver is not those cities nor do we want to be. 

In response to safety concerns voiced by citizens, Mr. Webb stated that city code requires sprinklers and other safety installations.  Therefore, we can be assured that domiciles under the new zoning proposal will conform to safety and fire codes.  

These building codes apply to new build, not to existing structures.  Old domiciles will not need to update and conform, just as current homeowners are ‚Äúgrandfathered‚Äù in on other unsafe situations such as illegal apartments that don‚Äôt meet current zoning requirements.    

Most of the rentals in my neighborhood have out of state owners who contribute directly to speculative housing price increases, do not care for the properties they own, and do not contribute one thing to our neighborhoods or the fabric of our community.  Why are we continuing to encourage more of this type of investment at the expense of our citizens?

WE are the economic base for Denver city initiatives.  WE are the fabric that holds community together and makes Denver a city that people of all ages want to live in.  WE are Denver residents. 
Ignoring our concerns and lumping everything the Committee has proposed under one umbrella is unconscionable.

Council representatives and mayor Hancock, I ask that you do the right thing for Denver and it‚Äôs citizens, and reject the Committee‚Äôs rezoning proposal. 

Respectfully,

Gail Sykes

So, mark, what do u have in mind for ur future?
I miss getting together with my friends without feeling like a hug could be deadly. But i dont miss the traffic. Which seems to be recovering.
Hate to say it, but the whole purpose of a city is commerce and services. With commerce and services shut down it has little of the value of a city. It you can work from home (or not work), value less traffic, a dark night sky, clearer air and the lack of a rat race, move out of a city. Kinda simple really.
Good points. But a city also offers options which are not easily found in rural areas.  I struggle between the two.
Thank you for that great photograph!
I'm definitely less stressed out and much calmer now.
I agree with your premise, but I don't think we're post-covid yet.  There are second waves starting in places that opened up too soon/without adequate testing, already.
Imagine
That quiet is the sound of millions of people losing their jobs, a lifetime of work being lost in a small businesses, and people wondering how to pay the bills.  We all want a smaller, slower, more intimate time but the cost to others is huge.
You are right, but the virus doesn‚Äôt care and we need to learn something at least.
Karen Kaiser What is that 'something' that we need to learn?

From Gail Sykes, with permission 
City Council members, Mayor Hancock and Andrew Webb,

I listened to Wednesday‚Äôs presentation by Andrew Webb regarding the recommended changes to Denver‚Äôs Group Living Zoning, and I want to express my strong concerns and opposition to what is happening.   

The Committee has lumped together so many major changes in to this proposal that citizens cannot intelligently consider what the overall impact will be to our city. 

The Committee says new zoning regulations will ‚Äúsimplify‚Äù the Zoning code for the city. This is blatantly untrue.  It will, in fact, create a quagmire for citizens and make it impossible for us to address our neighborhood‚Äôs needs. 

The proposed zoning changes push enforcement and monitoring of zoning regulations on to the citizens while absolving the city zoning agencies of any responsibility for the effects of the changes.  Citizens have been told we can call 311 or the police for help on violations. 

What involved citizens are hearing and being sensitive to is what affects them - not the holistic body of changes being proposed and what this re-zoning proposal ultimately means for our communities.   

Some people are concerned that the current definition of unrelated adults and their families is discriminatory to the LGBTQ community and that it does not recognize current societal norms or desire for communal living. 
They support the zoning proposal.

Older people are threatened by all of the changes at once, particularly with all of the neighborhood issues we are already facing each and every day, without government support.
They do not support the zoning proposal.

Homeowners and neighborhood communities are rightfully concerned about overcrowding, residential care facilities, homeless shelters, and prison facilities in the neighborhoods without clear and defined rules regarding density, proximity to schools and community gathering places , 
They do not support the recommended changes. 

Many people support pieces of the bill, but we cannot currently consider or support them separately.  I believe this is exactly what the special interests driving this initiative want - chaos, ignorance and apathy that will ensure approval of their initiative without allowing citizens to address each piece intelligently. This feels very much like what is happening to citizens on a national level, and is flat out wrong. 

The ‚Äúdata‚Äù, as we are consistently hearing from the Committee, is that it's good (!) for our neighborhoods  to encourage:  Severe overcrowding of single family residences without bathroom or minimum square footage requirements; unregulated and unlicensed halfway houses, residential care, nursing, rehab and correctional facilities without regard for children and home owners‚Äô well being; and expanded congregate living (rent by the room).  

Let me simplify - the Committee is paving the way for:  overcrowding of neighborhoods and public services for the enrichment of landlords and real estate speculators, profiting by private investors for the unregulated care of our most vulnerable citizens needing nursing and rehabilitation services, price gouging and profiting by investors of private prison expansion (that WE tax payers will also be paying for) and, of course,  Air B&B. 

And for all of this ‚Äúprogress‚Äù under the guise of ‚Äúaffordable housing and helping the homeless‚Äù,  we tax payers and citizens who have built these desirable neighborhoods to live in get to monitor and deal with the inevitable abuses and problems that will result. 

A selling point for the Committee is that  Seattle, Portland, Washington DC and other cities have this progressive model in place and it‚Äôs the way to go for Denver.  This conclusion is based on naivety and / or stupidity. Denver is not those cities nor do we want to be. 

In response to safety concerns voiced by citizens, Mr. Webb stated that city code requires sprinklers and other safety installations.  Therefore, we can be assured that domiciles under the new zoning proposal will conform to safety and fire codes.  

These building codes apply to new build, not to existing structures.  Old domiciles will not need to update and conform, just as current homeowners are ‚Äúgrandfathered‚Äù in on other unsafe situations such as illegal apartments that don‚Äôt meet current zoning requirements.    

Most of the rentals in my neighborhood have out of state owners who contribute directly to speculative housing price increases, do not care for the properties they own, and do not contribute one thing to our neighborhoods or the fabric of our community.  Why are we continuing to encourage more of this type of investment at the expense of our citizens?

WE are the economic base for Denver city initiatives.  WE are the fabric that holds community together and makes Denver a city that people of all ages want to live in.  WE are Denver residents. 
Ignoring our concerns and lumping everything the Committee has proposed under one umbrella is unconscionable.

Council representatives and mayor Hancock, I ask that you do the right thing for Denver and it‚Äôs citizens, and reject the Committee‚Äôs rezoning proposal. 

Respectfully,

Gail Sykes

Thank you City Council for disincentivizing further use of environmentally harmful plastics.
It's about time.
Bring your own shopping bags and you contribute to safe the environment!

Yay, joining the national trend of being aware of our consumption! https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/8/20/20806651/plastic-bag-ban-straw-ban-tax
Thank you Brad Patton.  Such an easy score for City Council. I read that the fees benefit the grocers.  Everybody needs more tax and fees at the grocery line.
These are not taxes or fees. Just the price of a bag that you are not required to buy. You only need to purchase plastic bags if you want. Personally I don‚Äôt want to buy a plastic bag so I bring my own.  If you think this is bad, the Mexican city I spend time in the winter has banned all bags and styrofoam. You don‚Äôt get the option to pay two pesos for a bag. You must bring your own.
I am good with that or bring our own bags which is what I normally do.  We need to be a part of making a difference.
This is done in California and works very well. Most people bring their bags to the store. We have to stop polluting just for the sake of saving money or time. Mother Earth needs help...NOW!
I wish they‚Äôd do what they did in California. The stores don‚Äôt carry plastic bags anymore
The stores in CA do carry plastic bags, they just charge you for them. And if you think it doesn‚Äôt make them money, think again. No way those low quality bags cost .10. More like .02-.03. Just making you aware. I always bring my own bags in CO, TX and CA. It‚Äôs just what you should do!!!
I hope this happens! Just bring your own bags, its easy. Also reusuable produce and bulk bags!
They‚Äôve been doing this for decades in Europe - let‚Äôs contribute to a significant decrease in plastic use!
Yes for 50 years at least, and they survived!
Thank you City Council. Long overdue!(edited)
Read the proposal: ‚Äú4 cents out of the 10 cents will be kept by the retailer.‚Äù And ‚Äúif the proposed ordinance does pass, the city would distribute reusable bags.‚Äù City resources for this, who pays for that, you?  The grocers should front this.
The grocers have to pay for the bags too, what‚Äôs wrong to charge for them? As already mentioned bring your own bags!
I fully support this. Anything to encourage people not to use plastic is ok in my book.
Agree 100% on the plastics issue.  But, we need to create and keep focus on priorities:  traffic management, speeding and zoning issues are far and away needing our collective DENVER attention‚Äîfirst and foremost.  If the issues I noted were being handled with expediency or dedication, I‚Äôd have no issue with the focus on plastic shopping bags.  
Yes, a lot of things require large scale changes, most require money and budget allocation.  This is an easy fix, that only cost consumers sone awareness.  Gotta start somewhere...(edited)
Thank you city council.  It‚Äôs a wonderful idea.  I already carry my own bags.  It‚Äôs very easy, not to mention affordable and environment friendly.  You should try it sometime!
I‚Äôm all for it.  We spoiled Americans need to do A LOT more for our environment.  This is merely a tiny step.
Excellent idea and I have seen it‚Äôs success in action when I lived in California for a year. Much better than a bag that either ends up in a landfill or a bag full of other bags after being used once. No need to be so wasteful, and this encourages people to recognize that!
100% agree with it.

Robin Wells I command you for what you are doing to stay afloat in this difficult times! Please dismiss rude comments, many more ppl feel to support each other! Best wishes...
Robin Wells  I can testify that Robin's masks are great.  I was so glad to have her make some for me since I can't sew and they are almost impossible to buy.  Her masks are complex and beautifully made.
Plus, it costs about five dollars a mask to make.
You are welcome!  I am fortunate to be able to donate masks to support non-profits who serve the homeless, sick kids, or single moms.  As a fiber artist, I have LOTS of beautiful fabric and thread in my stash so my immediate expenses are limited.  But I understand why there are people who are selling masks on this site.  With all the unemployment in our community, people are trying to just make ends meet.   They deserve our support.   Believe me, no one is ""making a living"" by making masks that sell for $8-$12 dollars.  As Barbara said it costs about $5 in materials.  Plus labor.  I can make about 4 masks per hour (and I'm a FAST sewer!) so even at a minimum wage of $15.00/hour, that would add another $3.75 so actually, someone selling masks for $8.00 is losing 75 cents for every mask they sell.
I need  a mask; can you send a photo ; is there a choice of styles?
The numbers here may relate to a particular person you know making them but in honesty the price of creating a mask can be so varied depending on where the materials are sourced from and the labor/skillset of the person making them.
And you are too Barbara!!!
Thanks either way.  Encourage everyone to wear a mask.  You could save someone!  Older, immune compromise or not in great health.

Robin Wells I apologize, I didn‚Äôt mean to offend. Thank you for all that you are doing. Please let us know if we can help you at all.
Sylvia Cohen Hi, who are you addressing this to?
","Masks. Shout Out to all you amazing people creating and giving out masks for free. You are amazing, your love of community, good hearts and minds are more than we could ask for ! 
In a time when people are charging up to 25$ a mask I've seen on here, you guys are real heros to these Viral times! 
Thank you for your amazing devotion, time, energy and kindness! 
You make such a difference! 
Thank You ‚ô°

This is not a post to offend those making masks to sell. 

This is a post to say thank you to those people who are able to get them out for free to our community! 
We have a lot of people in our community that cannot afford to buy a mask. The fact that you can't afford to buy a mask doesn't keep you from spreading germs, so in a place where perhaps our government should have stepped up to provide masks to every individual, big props to those who have stepped up to deliver those masks for free to those who can't afford them this way it can keep everybody and I mean everybody rich or poor from spreading germs to everybody else. 
The virus knows no monetary limits.I can‚Äôt believe people are charging for masks... have some compassion. Big thank you to the people giving masks away for free! You are the best of human spirit ‚ù§Ô∏è
Robin Wells I command you for what you are doing to stay afloat in this difficult times! Please dismiss rude comments, many more ppl feel to support each other! Best wishes...
Robin Wells  I can testify that Robin's masks are great.  I was so glad to have her make some for me since I can't sew and they are almost impossible to buy.  Her masks are complex and beautifully made.
Plus, it costs about five dollars a mask to make.
You are welcome!  I am fortunate to be able to donate masks to support non-profits who serve the homeless, sick kids, or single moms.  As a fiber artist, I have LOTS of beautiful fabric and thread in my stash so my immediate expenses are limited.  But I understand why there are people who are selling masks on this site.  With all the unemployment in our community, people are trying to just make ends meet.   They deserve our support.   Believe me, no one is ""making a living"" by making masks that sell for $8-$12 dollars.  As Barbara said it costs about $5 in materials.  Plus labor.  I can make about 4 masks per hour (and I'm a FAST sewer!) so even at a minimum wage of $15.00/hour, that would add another $3.75 so actually, someone selling masks for $8.00 is losing 75 cents for every mask they sell.
I need  a mask; can you send a photo ; is there a choice of styles?
The numbers here may relate to a particular person you know making them but in honesty the price of creating a mask can be so varied depending on where the materials are sourced from and the labor/skillset of the person making them.
And you are too Barbara!!!
Thanks either way.  Encourage everyone to wear a mask.  You could save someone!  Older, immune compromise or not in great health.

Flophouse Zoning
This is interesting.  Maybe I‚Äôm not interpreting things correctly right now but is the current code that you can only have two unrelated adults no matter the size of the house or number of bedrooms? If that‚Äôs the case, much like a lot of our zoning, permitting, etc I doubt it‚Äôs being followed in the first place.
Tim Russell my neighbors at one point had 11 people living in an 900 sq ft. house. They had dogs who were never on leashes, they basically ignored the city's noise ordinances, and had multiple cars parked far beyond the three day rule of street parking in Denver. I was able to report all of these issues to the city, but it stemmed from them violating the current group-living rule. After the city's code enforcement came out, just like magic my neighborhood is quiet again. The group-living rule isn't always followed, but the city is responsive to code violations.
Laura Baumgaartner Exactly! once the city removes the current zoning if a neighbor does this, you would have no recourse.  And good luck selling your house with that next door.
Here is the link with meeting dates and lots of info:
Sounds horrible. Too many people in Denver now.. Time to sell and move.
If u think it‚Äôs time to sell good luck with that and finding somewhere else to move. I don‚Äôt get u people it‚Äôs time to sell and move because u have a house in ur block or next door to u with a lot of people in it. Tell me how does how another persons living arrangements affect u?
Once/if the city removes the current zoning if a neighbor rents to a bunch of people/construction workers with cars/trucks you would have no recourse.  And good luck selling your house with that next door.
One of my thoughts, exactly.
People that want to live this way already are. I guarantee that law is not enforced. I doubt there will be any increase in households due to this law change.
Real estate investors are very good at exploiting weak zoning rules.  
Good point.  And if the rental creates problems for the nearest neighbors, they may move and so on in a chain reaction that destroys a nice neighborhood.  The developers have Hancock in their back pocket because they funded his re-election campaign.
That rule is obscured especially since the cost of living is outrageous . Why does it matter how many people r in a house ? None of their business a persons living conditions. They have a roof over their head probably the best they can afford. A lot of families, it is their culture for the  all of the family to live together.
Yes. A lot of extended families live together. The change is to increase from 2 unrelated adults living together to 8 unrelated adults and unlimited minors living together.
Actually if a persons living conditions moves into the street such as with the smell of animal hoarders it will become other's business, wouldn't you agree? Blanket statements don't work.
What kind of group homes r these? Just families or, for people newly released from jail or what.
I think if people own their owns - no one has a right to tell them who can and can‚Äôt live in their home. As for renters, I highly doubt a rental company or landlord would allow 11+ people in a house. Renting is NOT cheap in Denver. My rental is $1,750 for a shitty, 675 sqft house. I need a roommate, if it was > 2 bedrooms I would have more roommates.
People buy their homes with expectations that are determined to large degree by the characteristics of the neighborhood, which in turn is determined by city code.  It's not appropriate to alter the code so dramatically.  These are numbers I would expect for a neighborhood of opium dens.
Sadie, the city has codes and they allow how many unrelated people may live in a home.
Perhaps it's a mistake and they mean 16,000 square feet for that many people.  1600 is too little even for 5 adults + minors.
It could be students trying to make ends meet or families rents can barley be afforded by one person or even 2, wages r not that great either, I‚Äôm sorry u feel u would have to move, the conditions could be worse.
I understand choosing a neighborhood by character, as long as rentals and Bonn exist anything is subject to change. Maybe a neighbor that is already established would be better but if it is sold things could still change. I‚Äôm sure people who moved to Cole, Whittier and five points did not consider the location but only the home they wanted to buy, inner city and urban city r different, the only way to get away from these things is suburbs, there is even crime there. Let ur concerns be known that‚Äôs all u can do.
It may be a way to work with the homeless population buy increasing multi family dwelling. I am not affected with this change right now but it could be a matter of time. Homes in my area r not large enough for multi family dwellings. I am a landlord and a person with that many people would not even look at my property for multi family dwelling not enough rom by far. My property is 3 bedroom I rent now. My tenant has been with me for over 10 years. That‚Äôs a blessing for me, it is a single mom and 2 kids.
Yes if that is the case but that is an extreme example, doesn‚Äôt happen that much where it could  be noticed, it is at that point someone‚Äôs business. But not my problem to just move, the city or whoever else would deal with that problem. Not worth giving up my house to move, there are other choices.
Why profile, OMG, I can‚Äôt believe, the responses of some of the neighbors on ND.? Team work makes the dream work, so quit complaining which usually will get u no where unless directed to the correct officials

Hi! I just made some plain green or blue masks. 100%cotton. I‚Äôm at 825 Saint Paul.
$10 a piece
Costco on Wadsworth has 3-packs of plain black/red/blue
These are great because they are adjustable.
I saw Capital Heights has some plain cloth masks.
Definitely try Etsy. There‚Äôs all price points.
dry cleaner on 12th and elizabeth selling masks, $7.
If you need them right away, Target has them in chambray, gray, and other plainer colors for $2 each or $4/2 pack. They're under ""women's,"" but they're unisex.
I have masks available.

Lutrelle, you are a great friend! I have a great one for a man, but it is colorful. Made by Prince's, Cher's, Jimmy Buffet's, and Celine Diaz's clothing designers. It has a beautiful African textile print (blue and yellow), so if a fashionable man would like it, please everyone, let me know. Let's let this mask go to someone who would be proud to wear Prince's designer's gear! It is made from a customary pattern and really well made.(edited)
Thanks.  It sounds great for a fashionable man, but my friend would not wear it.  I'm sure a lot of other men will.  Stay safe.

The city requires that the event sponsors clean the area thoroughly after a big event. If they don't, the city can retain fees from the permit to reimburse for additional clean up activities. They can also charge the sponsor for damages. Typically Parks will also close off areas that are being overused to allow the grass to recover. There are maintenance crews that cover the park as well as a nonprofit, called Civic Center Conservancy, which also helps with park related issues. You may want to contact the Conservancy and also Parks and Recreation. Given the proximity of the park to city services, it will continue to be a place for homeless to gather until we, as a city, can address the issues facing homeless persons in a comprehensive fashion.(edited)
Hey Laurie, this has been an issue for many years now and just one of the factors that city council passed their camping bans. Still, the city doesn‚Äôt really have any incentive to clean up every day and to date I have not heard a good solution to the problem.
Wouldn't it be great if whomever has trash, ie: homeless or not, put their trash in the trash barrel. 
Even those who have homes drop trash all over.  Try walking around a middle or high school..
I think a huge issue across the city is the lack of accessible trash receptacles.
CW Candi CdeBaca is advocating for more public trash receptacles and pickups along neighborhoods and on city streets.
Amazing that a simple thing like an adequate amount of trash receptacles is such a tough figure for Denver Government. 
It's called anticipation.

EOC is a nonprofit organization with the mission of making sure that all Coloradans can afford their energy needs.  We work extensively with the State of Colorado and all major utilities around the state.

In this pandemic year, more Coloradans are struggling financially and help with their energy costs can make a big difference in their lives and, in many cases, keep a family from homelessness.  If you are struggling with your energy bills this winter, please visit the EOC website (www.energyoutreach.org) to see if you might qualify for assistance. 

If you are fortunate enough to be in a position to help your neighbors with their energy costs, I would ask you to consider EOC in your year-end giving.

253,404,404,182686900,City of Denver,,7 Apr,"I want a COVID-19 vaccine, but... As of April 3, 2021, all Coloradans age 16 and older are eligible to get their vaccine. You do not need insurance and the vaccine is free. Still, vaccine access can be confusing, and sometimes things get in the way of getting the healthcare you need. If you are facing any of the following barriers to vaccine access, we have services and resources to help. 

... I can‚Äôt get an appointment.

Vaccine supply doesn‚Äôt currently meet the demand in our community, and appointments can be hard to come by. Still, all residents are strongly encouraged to get a vaccine as soon as they can, wherever they can. 

In Denver, the state is currently operating Ball Arena as a mass vaccination site. Schedule an appointment by visiting truecare24.com/co. The City and County of Denver also supports four community vaccination sites to ensure residents in vulnerable communities have easy access to the vaccine. Residents ages 18 and over can call 720-865-3005 for information about dates, times, and registration requirements. 

There are also many resources available online and by phone to help you find an appointment or get on a waitlist for providers in your area. Sites like www.vaccinefinder.org and www.vaccinespotter.org/CO/ are up-to-date tools that help you track down COVID-19 vaccine appointment openings, and providers like Kroger, Safeway, CVS, and Walgreens all have appointment systems of their own.  

Find more information about vaccine options in Denver at www.denvergov.org/Government/COVID-19-Information/Vaccination 

... I can‚Äôt leave my home for medical reasons.

The Denver Department of Public Health and Environment offers at-home vaccination for people who can't leave their homes. For more information on how to get this service, visit our website or call the DDPHE at 720-865-3005 and press option 4. 

... I don‚Äôt have a ride.

If you lack access to transportation, call Mile High United Way‚Äôs 2-1-1 help center. Mile High United Way and Lyft have partnered to help Denver residents get to their non-emergency vaccine appointments.

Mile High United Way connects residents to childcare for those who need it. Call 2-1-1 for more information. 

... I have a health condition and I‚Äôm afraid the vaccine could make me sick.

According to the CDC, most people with underlying health issues can safely take the vaccine. If you are worried, talk to your doctor. 

... I am undocumented.

You do not have to be a documented citizen to get a vaccine. Providers may ask for ID or insurance information at your vaccine appointment. These documents ARE NOT required to get your shot. You will not be turned away for not having these documents. 

... I have a language barrier.

The City of Denver‚Äôs community vaccine sites provide language support for a variety of languages, as do many other vaccine providers in the community.  

... I am afraid of needles.

Understandable! Healthcare providers are trained to make the vaccine shot as painless as possible. Don‚Äôt let your fears keep you from getting this lifesaving vaccine! 

... I have concerns about effectiveness.

The COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in preventing infection. All vaccines available in the U.S. are nearly 100% effective in preventing serious illness and death related to the virus.

Thanks for this!  It's been printed and posted on the fridge.
Are you advocating someone who‚Äôs been sexually assaulted not contacting the police? Are you high?
I do not think the above advocated not contacting the police regarding a sexual assault at all. Nowhere does that seem to even come up. The Elijah McClain case has no mention of sexual assault. This new comment is inflammatory, diverting and misleading. The above was to expand information, options and resources for people. Especially when just about everyone (on all sides) agrees that we need more and better mental health resources in this country.  This comment incorrectly and inappropriately tries to make this a black-&-white, us-versus-them argument. How can that be helpful in any functioning society.
Uh, I am 100% calling the cops if sexual assault is involved. And the mere fact that that was included on this list makes me doubt the rest.
Mental Health services, Food Access, Homelessness. There are good resources on this list. just mark out those you do not agree with. Eliminating everything else makes little sense to me.
Edward Hoffman I appreciate you acknowledging that it said that. I‚Äôm merely pointing it‚Äôs dangerous to advocate things with little thought to how they result. I‚Äôm absolutely proud of calling it larping because that‚Äôs what it is . I‚Äôm not on board to move our society to together to a better place ( what an absolutely insipid and meaningless platitude ) when marxists are leading this. I‚Äôm watching statues of abolitionists and American heroes like tedy Roosevelt get destroyed by the mob. I lived through the gang war here in the summer 92 did you? Have you ever experienced violent crime because I have. I‚Äôve visited third world countries with non functioning police forces, have you?
I was not here in 1992. I was not involved in world war 2. i was not involved in the influenza epidemic of the 1918. I was not involved in the black death bubonic plague. i do believe in science and progress. I do believe you are distorting what is going on in our society right now - yes there are some bad actors and excessive actions. how does that excuse white supremacy, slavery, or repressive police states? it is a false (fake news) argument that this is all a mob of marxists and that we are moving towards a 3rd world country with a non-functioning police force. You could help moving things in the right direction (because it will move somewhere) but everything you are writing will just distort and overwhelm any meaningful diaglogue. If you believe every person for himself, don't help your neighbor up but just leave him down, oppress anyone different from you, and the police and laws are to keep the rich rich and the poor poor, then we really have nothing to say. I do believe in law and order and fairness. I also believe this world and humans have more faults then good qualities; how many wars do we have? is Denver getting hot enough for you (or do you not believe in science or climate change either)? You may want to live in an imperfect world and keep it so, or make it even worse. I believe differently, and am not wasting more time on this.
I agree the gang war was rough.  I have vivid stories from that time as a charge nurse.  It was rough
Edward Hoffman respectfully you‚Äôre putting words in my mouth, and that‚Äôs a lazy argument. So basically you haven‚Äôt witnessed gang violence or seen the affects of these terrifying policy proposals, and me as someone who has experienced them is pointing this out yet you dismiss me as being backwards. My great great great great grandfather died at Vicksburg fighting to end slavery, the other side of my family died in Buchenwald, excuse me if I don‚Äôt feel the need express white guilt. In fact I believe people should be judged by content of their character not by the color of their skin. I don‚Äôt believe in group guilt for your ancestors. When I spent time in Germany I didn‚Äôt blame the grandchildren for the crimes of some of their families. In the mean time i would take a step back and ponder why people advocate not calling 911 in the case of sexual assault.
Thank you for sharing! This is great!
It boils down to humans having opinions/views based on their life experiences, and calcifying around that 'model'. So when they make a statement from the view of their existence, it is met by force.

A new service being piloted STAR based on Eugene OR's CAHOOTS. No police- paramedic and mental health professionals respond in non-police vehicle 720-913- STAR. Last week it was reported 105 calls - zero police involvement. People are connected with resources and follow up case management. 
You can call whomever you want>  And please keep politics off of these neighborhood post.  Why don't you just forward it to your email contact list and spare the rest of us from reading your opinions.
And note to the editors or the people who oversee this website, FYI  I don't need to read political opinions, or be on nextdoor.  But it was helpful today because a neighborhood dog fell into our window well and the owner posted that his dog was lost and I contacted him.  That is useful information, politics - not so much.
Sorry, I could and have been clearer, STAR is a response for people in a mental health crisis. Deescalation and support  are offered for people in those circumstances. If necessary police will be involved, so far they have not been needed. The approach adds one more step in de-stigmatizing mental health issues. The program was featured in the Denverite recently. 720-913-STAR. Stay well folks.
I‚Äôve never heard of star. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs political to realize mentally ill people can be frightened by police and it‚Äôs good to have an alternative. But who staffs STAR. People have to go voluntarily, right?  Aren‚Äôt police and psychiatrists only ones that can place a MH hold.
Thank you SO MUCH for posting this!
Love this. Thank you!
Thank you for the info! I‚Äôm sorry people have to pick apart every little thing! People will twist and turn every thing just to find something wrong!! This is a great resource!
Thank you for the list and the info on STAR.  I hope both are widely distributed so we all learn that who to call depends on the situation.
","Alternatives to Calling 911. Here are some Denver alternatives to 911 that may be more appropriate than a traditional all-police response (attached photo). 

Edit: I am not saying to never call the police, and all of these sources listed here say to call 911 if someone is in danger. In the case below, no one was in danger until the police showed up.

The incredibly sad story of Elijah McClain‚Äôs killing has a lot of traffic now and I want to point out that police are not trained to interact with anyone who is not neurotypical, instead seeing someone who different as a threat. I see a lot of similar reports of ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù behavior on Nextdoor and want to stress that someone who was ‚Äújust trying to help‚Äù by calling the police on someone led to the death of one of their neighbors.How do I get that list? Everyone should have this.
Great point! Here‚Äôs the link from the QR code in the bottom right: https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/15h7weAT5lFk3XbOsFDoeqo8gePqJYMUu?usp=sharing
Thank you so much for posting this! We need to tap into other amazing resources we have right here in our community!
I have had many patients arrive safely in the ED via police or ambulance high on meth
that‚Äôs great, but it is unrelated and it doesn‚Äôt invalidate the countless people who are killed by racist and negligent police/first responders
Thanks for this!  It's been printed and posted on the fridge.
Are you advocating someone who‚Äôs been sexually assaulted not contacting the police? Are you high?
I do not think the above advocated not contacting the police regarding a sexual assault at all. Nowhere does that seem to even come up. The Elijah McClain case has no mention of sexual assault. This new comment is inflammatory, diverting and misleading. The above was to expand information, options and resources for people. Especially when just about everyone (on all sides) agrees that we need more and better mental health resources in this country.  This comment incorrectly and inappropriately tries to make this a black-&-white, us-versus-them argument. How can that be helpful in any functioning society.
Uh, I am 100% calling the cops if sexual assault is involved. And the mere fact that that was included on this list makes me doubt the rest.
Mental Health services, Food Access, Homelessness. There are good resources on this list. just mark out those you do not agree with. Eliminating everything else makes little sense to me.
Edward Hoffman I appreciate you acknowledging that it said that. I‚Äôm merely pointing it‚Äôs dangerous to advocate things with little thought to how they result. I‚Äôm absolutely proud of calling it larping because that‚Äôs what it is . I‚Äôm not on board to move our society to together to a better place ( what an absolutely insipid and meaningless platitude ) when marxists are leading this. I‚Äôm watching statues of abolitionists and American heroes like tedy Roosevelt get destroyed by the mob. I lived through the gang war here in the summer 92 did you? Have you ever experienced violent crime because I have. I‚Äôve visited third world countries with non functioning police forces, have you?
I was not here in 1992. I was not involved in world war 2. i was not involved in the influenza epidemic of the 1918. I was not involved in the black death bubonic plague. i do believe in science and progress. I do believe you are distorting what is going on in our society right now - yes there are some bad actors and excessive actions. how does that excuse white supremacy, slavery, or repressive police states? it is a false (fake news) argument that this is all a mob of marxists and that we are moving towards a 3rd world country with a non-functioning police force. You could help moving things in the right direction (because it will move somewhere) but everything you are writing will just distort and overwhelm any meaningful diaglogue. If you believe every person for himself, don't help your neighbor up but just leave him down, oppress anyone different from you, and the police and laws are to keep the rich rich and the poor poor, then we really have nothing to say. I do believe in law and order and fairness. I also believe this world and humans have more faults then good qualities; how many wars do we have? is Denver getting hot enough for you (or do you not believe in science or climate change either)? You may want to live in an imperfect world and keep it so, or make it even worse. I believe differently, and am not wasting more time on this.

255,406,406,133146870,Jim Celmer,Cherry Creek North,29 Dec 19,Is it offensive to call someone sweetie? I‚Äôm from the south and saying sweetie is like saying Ma‚Äôam. For me it‚Äôs a sign of respect and gratitude.  Is it inappropriate? Do I need to talk differently or do people need hear better? I‚Äôm open please be nice.,offensive sweetie south say sweetie say sign respect gratitude inappropriate need talk differently people need hear well open nice,"Sweetie is great for a child. I‚Äôm not offended by it but women are not sweeties, unless of course they are ‚Äúyour‚Äù sweetie! üòä
Miss Bonnie you have a valid point. When I give someone a compliment I want to hear it the way I mean it. Not take offense
Jim Celmer you are very considerate!
I was born in a small west Texas town many years ago at a time and place where manners and respect were taught..and just as important as the lessons I learned in school. Now as a ""mature"" gentleman from the south..Ma'am is the preferred greeting to a lady that I have never encountered before. To a lady that will recognize me from a previous crossing of paths sweetheart or dear is acceptable..in my humble opinion. I would never address a stranger as sweetie.(edited)
I also have difficulty remembering names so I go to sweetie. I‚Äôm so sorry ladies
üò¨
It can be perceived as condescending by some. It‚Äôs about context. Generally, I only let people close to me use something like that. If you don‚Äôt have an equal or clear relationship with the recipient, best to not use it.
Also, age and gender of the person calling me ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù does have an impact. Best to be mindful of that as well. :)
Sweetie is an endearment saved for people in your inner circle. I would find it unnerving if someone not dead to my heart (and older) used it when speaking to me.
I promise I‚Äôm just trying to be nice. I will change how I talk. Thanks for helping me.
Oh my!!!! It offends to be nice!
I believe in the north that being called ma'am, sweetie or dear is perceived as ""OMG--I'm old!"" 
Miss Bonnie. Would you prefer Ma‚Äôam or miss? I‚Äôm being honest.  I will switch out sweetie  for the right word. Thanks.
Absolutely, Ma'am. ""Miss"" is the correct title for my 11 year old granddaughter. I notice many young people addressing 70 year old me as ""miss"", which I find very condescending. I've earned the title ""Ma'am.""
Yes, I would lean towards Ma‚Äôam.
Today, people are always looking for a reason to be offended and run to their safe spaces.  So try to restrain yourself. It does not offend me.  But then, I'm looking for joy...not a reason to be offended.
Ditto. 
I agree 100% Evelinda. I don‚Äôt mind being called sweetie because I look at the intent behind it.
Jim, one thing I learned long ago is to be authentic and not be what others want you to be. Soon as you do, they're in charge, exactly what they want. 
Ok sweetie.
Im southern and I call people sweetie, baby, honey, pumpkin,  peaches, sweet xheeks, etc. If they are offended, thats their problem. Im not going to censor myself .. idiots getad and 'offended"" if yoy call them ma'am or sir!!ü§£ü§£ü§£ Just keeping being you and live your life. People look for reasons to be upset and you dont need all that!
I agree with you with exception, sweetie, you are not in the south!   Those from the north have another language and it would be nice to have a happy medium.   I‚Äôve lived all over the country and it just feels better to fit in rather than rock the boat.
Bonnie McCay well, we are supposed to accept. everyone, right Sweetie? Maybe Colorado needs  sweetness from the south! Ive also lived all over and never had a problem with sweetie or any term lol. Maybe the problem lies with the offended. I mean what a ridiculous thing to be upset about regardless of location .
Ignore the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù people who are looking to be offended. Intent is everything. Most rational and emotionally mature people understand that.
There's an inverse correlation between one's level of wokeness and emotional intelligence...
Joshua Wilson ü§£
Incidentally, anyone who has ever stopped at a ‚Äúmom & pop‚Äù diner in the south or rural Midwest knows all about such terms. Leave ignorance to the ignorant and be who you are.
I get that--the truck-stop waitress calling you sweetie is expected, a cliche, a movie moment! Not offensive at all to me. Usually the director has her chewing gum as well.
I‚Äôm Southern too. And I advise against it. Thanks for posing the question. You sound like a great guy.
It may not be offensive but I don't like it. Take the trouble to find out my name and use it. BTW, I'm 79, and I've felt that way all my adult life.(edited)
Me 2
Jim - I think it's great you're asking the question - I sent you a Private Message with my response.
Are you calling women or men sweetie?
I understand the intent, but it can be offensive in the wrong context. Do you have a southern accent? Did you just ask your equal female coworker to get you coffee ""sweetie""? Ooof thats condecending. Are you warning a stranger about a puddle in the sidewalk ""look out, sweetie""? Perfectly fine. Are you asking a stranger out for the first time? No, too forward .""What makes you think I am your sweetie after talking to you for less than 3 min?"" This one might just be my hangup. Are you speaking to a child? Sure go for it.
Yeah, Ma'am is a scary line in the sands of Time... I advise defaulting to 'miss', always.
I agree that context matters, but unless talking to little children, probably best to err on the side of not calling women ""sweetie.""  I'm sure it's a cultural thing.  It seems as if some places use Mr. and Mrs. (usually Miss) followed by a first name.  That always sounds strange and a bit condescending to me.  Just my first name is fine, or Mrs./Ms and my last name.  But I do understand cultural differences and don't feel too upset. I will ask someone I interact with regularly to just call me by my first name.
I'd just stick with m'am or miss. I don't like being called sweetie by strangers.

256,407,407,135804957,Lynn Turner,Congress Park,1 Feb 20,"Be aware when pulling into garages from alley. At around 6:40pm tonite a man slipped into my garage as I was pulling in with my daughter in our car after a basketball game.  He approached the car and said ‚Äòdon‚Äôt kill me‚Äô, and startled me when I opened the car door.  I asked him to leave several times and he rambled about his band, Georgia, some issues with a female.  He was carrying a sizable metal flashlight.  Each time I asked him to leave, he seemed aggravated and would say ‚ÄòAnyway...‚Äô and continue in non-coherent sentences.  He was under some kind of influence and his tone was sad, desperate, pushy, aggravated...all over the board.  It was sad.  He was in his late 40s or early fifties, white male, black ball cap with Metalhead in white letters, black long sleeve metal tee shirt with sleeves rolled up, tattoo sleeves both forearms, blue eyes, skinny and around 5‚Äô7.  This went on for 10-15min before I was able to get him to leave the garage.  It freaked my daughter out.  It has been reported to the police, they were very responsive.  Just be vigilant when entering your garages!

Thank you and glad you both are okay.  I am very cautious about getting in and out of my garage.  PLEASE lock your car the second you get in it.  Also lock your car when putting gas in your car.  You are distracted and thieves will reach in and grab your wallet, purse, etc.
Yup! I do this all the time! I learned in college to lock my car door as someone tried to get into my car at a stop sign one night!(edited)
Awful. Really awful.
Denver voters passed Caring 4 Denver, a sales tax increase to provide, initially, $45 million a year for mental health and addiction services. We should all become familiar with this new mental health funding source and make our taxpaying voices heard about our community priorities. http://caring4denver.org/
Wow!  You said he slipped in as you entered.  I often push my opener as I round a corner when I can't see the garage door yet.  From now on I'll be waiting until I'm close to the garage before opening the door.
...Which makes this extra scary, because, 1) he may have been waiting for her to come home (like, having been watching her house, knows her schedule, etc), and 2) despite acting as though he had been ‚Äúcaught‚Äù, he knew that she was going to be aware of his presence, and still didn‚Äôt care, which can be interpreted that he was willing/planning to take aggressive actions against her.
Lynn - this sounds so frightening. I‚Äôm so sorry.
Thanks for the heads up!  I will be more diligent. I‚Äôm so happy neither of you got hurt. It could have ended badly.
That's scary and I'm glad you are okay. I've had people try to slip into my apartment building when I'm entering or leaving. I think some of them are looking for a warm place to stay.  It's sad the richest country in the world can give aid to the mentally ill and homeless. There are over a million in America.
Thank you for sharing this.  I can't imagine how unsettling that was.  I come late from work and always wait until the garage is closed before getting out of the car, but I never thought someone might have already slipped inside.  So scary!  I hope you and your daughter are ok!  Thanks for making us all more aware.
Anna Kaye We are fine, it was a bit startling and definitely scary at moments, but as it turned out...he got a few things off his chest that were important to him and no one was hurt.  Sometimes
That's wonderful, Lynn.  You truly are a beautiful person and a lovely example for your daughter.
Wow wow wow
One tip I was given is to back into the garage so I can see anyone entering before I exit the car.  The police told me next time to get back in the car and call 9-1-1.  Hope this helps someone else if ever in that situation...
Um...yeah!
I agree with backing in...you can stay in your car until the door goes down and if someone follows you in just drive out...we also always lock the door from the garage into the house so the intruder couldn‚Äôt get into the house.
I'm glad you're ok and that it was just a lonely, disturbed man and not someone violent. I am heartened by all the responses showing compassion (as well as your post!) for the man.  But also thanks for the reminder for everyone to be more aware of their surroundings.  That's always good advice.
Wow! This is one of my worst fears and have prepared myself in what to do in this situation. My plan is to NOT engage in chit chat but start blowing the horn and sound the alarm while calling 911. Glad you're safe.
jimminy crickets..so scary...so so glad you are both OK..and hope you stay that way..
Scary! Be smart and don't get out of the car without checking mirrors and doing a blindspot check. This might be the same man caught in our alley a few weeks ago! Sadly he only got community service despite violating his probation and repeatedly returning to our neighborhood!
Thanks for sharing Robby.   Was the man stopped in Park Hill slipping into garages and trespassing or what was he caught doing and on probation for?  Thanks, I think awareness of repeat behavior is helpful to know for neighbors.
Yikes.  One  of my fears too because sadly this happened a few years ago to a friend in Crestmoor.  Someone came into the garage when she pulled in with her son (13yo) and they beat her to steal her purse.  I've also heard of a local situation where a man demanded that the woman drive to an ATM (at gunpoint) for money.  the garages (and alleys) are ripe for these types of crimes because the victim is startled and also has no escape.  I actually sit in my locked car every time I pull in to the garage, day or night, until my door is down before I get out.  I think about these two incidences every time I pull in.  I am so grateful that in the current situation it turned out ok.
That's so awful.  I'm very sorry to hear that...I feel grateful nothing bad happened and now will be more aware.

Allie Powell 11th & Columbine
I recently went to an apartment building to do some work for a tenant  and on my way out there was guy walking up to the front door.  I apologized to him, but told him I didn't know him, didn't live there and had to let the door close behind me.  He said no problem and had a code to get in.  Maybe all people should be reminded to follow this ""procedure"".
","Be aware when pulling into garages from alley. At around 6:40pm tonite a man slipped into my garage as I was pulling in with my daughter in our car after a basketball game.  He approached the car and said ‚Äòdon‚Äôt kill me‚Äô, and startled me when I opened the car door.  I asked him to leave several times and he rambled about his band, Georgia, some issues with a female.  He was carrying a sizable metal flashlight.  Each time I asked him to leave, he seemed aggravated and would say ‚ÄòAnyway...‚Äô and continue in non-coherent sentences.  He was under some kind of influence and his tone was sad, desperate, pushy, aggravated...all over the board.  It was sad.  He was in his late 40s or early fifties, white male, black ball cap with Metalhead in white letters, black long sleeve metal tee shirt with sleeves rolled up, tattoo sleeves both forearms, blue eyes, skinny and around 5‚Äô7.  This went on for 10-15min before I was able to get him to leave the garage.  It freaked my daughter out.  It has been reported to the police, they were very responsive.  Just be vigilant when entering your garages!  

Person 1
Hair: Black ballcap with Metalhead in white letters 
Top: Black long sleeve tee shirt 
Bottom: Jeans 
Age: 50 
Sex: Male 
Race: White 
Physical Build: Skinny 
Other: Metal flashlight, 5‚Äô7

I have reported this information to the police.Sorry that happened to you...frightening.  Sad people out there that desperately need helpüò™
Thank you and glad you both are okay.  I am very cautious about getting in and out of my garage.  PLEASE lock your car the second you get in it.  Also lock your car when putting gas in your car.  You are distracted and thieves will reach in and grab your wallet, purse, etc.
Yup! I do this all the time! I learned in college to lock my car door as someone tried to get into my car at a stop sign one night!(edited)
Awful. Really awful.
Denver voters passed Caring 4 Denver, a sales tax increase to provide, initially, $45 million a year for mental health and addiction services. We should all become familiar with this new mental health funding source and make our taxpaying voices heard about our community priorities. http://caring4denver.org/
Wow!  You said he slipped in as you entered.  I often push my opener as I round a corner when I can't see the garage door yet.  From now on I'll be waiting until I'm close to the garage before opening the door.
...Which makes this extra scary, because, 1) he may have been waiting for her to come home (like, having been watching her house, knows her schedule, etc), and 2) despite acting as though he had been ‚Äúcaught‚Äù, he knew that she was going to be aware of his presence, and still didn‚Äôt care, which can be interpreted that he was willing/planning to take aggressive actions against her.
Lynn - this sounds so frightening. I‚Äôm so sorry.
Thanks for the heads up!  I will be more diligent. I‚Äôm so happy neither of you got hurt. It could have ended badly.
That's scary and I'm glad you are okay. I've had people try to slip into my apartment building when I'm entering or leaving. I think some of them are looking for a warm place to stay.  It's sad the richest country in the world can give aid to the mentally ill and homeless. There are over a million in America.
Thank you for sharing this.  I can't imagine how unsettling that was.  I come late from work and always wait until the garage is closed before getting out of the car, but I never thought someone might have already slipped inside.  So scary!  I hope you and your daughter are ok!  Thanks for making us all more aware.
Anna Kaye We are fine, it was a bit startling and definitely scary at moments, but as it turned out...he got a few things off his chest that were important to him and no one was hurt.  Sometimes
That's wonderful, Lynn.  You truly are a beautiful person and a lovely example for your daughter.
Wow wow wow
One tip I was given is to back into the garage so I can see anyone entering before I exit the car.  The police told me next time to get back in the car and call 9-1-1.  Hope this helps someone else if ever in that situation...
Um...yeah!

The Arvada Safeway has sugar yesterday morning. I was there a little after 7. It has also been available through Prime Now and Amazon Fresh although delivery windows are hard to get.
Correction, Wheat Ridge Safeway. I go there when I go to the Arvada Costco. Also, I have some extra packs of yeast that you would be welcome to. Right before all this happened I thought I was ordering nine individual packs of yeast, but it was nine packs of 3 so 27 packs! Have donated some but still have some available.
The Cap Hill King Soops has sugar if you go around 8am. I got some Tuesday
Marcyzk has yeast.  It's not instant though.
Hi, Gladys: I can share sugar with you from Sam‚Äôs Club if you DM me your address. I had trouble finding it, so joined here and went for the first time this am.
It‚Äôs not a perfect fix but if you can find a box of Pillsbury Hot Roll Mix it comes with a packet of instant yeast.
Flour and sugar at the Safeway on 14th this morning
12th Ave Market has yeast! As of yesterday around 5pm
A pizza shop is having a sale right now of flour and yeast , I have to return with the name though
Did you remember the pizza shop?  I would love to get some yeast. I'm immobile due to a broken leg and ankle and baking is pretty much my only pastime.  :)(edited)
I have a mother if anyone wants to feed their own starter once a week to bake! Let me know!
Target on Glendale  yesterday at 7am had a ton of packets and little jars and i think I also saw sugar. You can make sourdough starter from flour and water which then has heaps of yeast and then you can make stuff with the discard after you feed it every day.
Great Harvest sells yeast!
Marzyks on Colfax had cans of yeast last week...
I suggest you call Walmart about the sugar.  They did have flour.
I can share yeast if you send me your address. It‚Äôs instant. Dm me.
Good human alert.  This is a really great reply.
The Noshery at 50th and Lowell (I used to be a baker there) is selling staples, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd sell some yeast as well.
try Natural Grocers or Trader Joe's.  But don't go without wearing a mask!
I'd be happy to share yeast with anyone who needs some.  I drove around in frustration myself, and managed to find a can of italian yeast at Marzyks.  So I can share.    And if anyone has some sourdough starter they are willing to share with me, I'd love some.
I‚Äôd be happy to share some sourdough starter with anyone. My starter, Eric the Bread, has been doing overtime lately. üò¨

They are all so nice there. I hope the person recovers quickly. Thanks for the heads up.
Ironically, I was about to head over there when I read this.  I can't tell from this post if the person had it back in April and they are telling you, or if this was recent.  I'm going to avoid Target for a little bit just in case because if 1 employee had it, it's likely that others contracted it as well.  I really, really appreciate this information.  Along the same lines, one of the King Soopers in Denver currently has 8 employees with COVID.  It's from the Colorado Dept. of Health website, so they won't state which one, just that it's in Denver.
There was one employee at the King Soopers on Chestnut Place (20th and Wewatta by Union Station) a couple months ago. Maybe other employees at that one; I haven't heard of any others.
I know of the one downtown King Soopers on 20th by Union Station.
Thanks for sharing this information.
If they are not at the location, you can't get it from them.  If you are worried, stay home.
Read a medical journal about how long this can remain on surfaces. 
....the irony. Taking the chance at getting ‚Äúthe Corona‚Äù at a place named ‚ÄúTarget‚Äù, specifically.
I don't think anyone needs to worry about this. They have cleaned multiple times since then, and let's be honest, I am sure there have been a lot of people who have been in and out of the store and have had the virus as well as other employees. This goes for many other businesses that are currently open. Take precautions, yes, but just note there is no foolproof way to avoid catching this. You would have to never leave your house again to be sure. I just read an article that a virologist was recently diagnosed with it and he took every precaution possible. He contracted it through his eyes.
Wow! So now we'll have to wear a mask that covers not only our nose & mouth, but also our EYES??  lol
I think posts like this are helpful.  In this case, if this was really back in April when the employee got sick, and no one has been sick since, it's not necessary to be afraid or avoid Target.  But, in the case of King Soopers, the date of the illness being on May 12th and 8 staff members sick, I think it's better to avoid.  Those 8 staff members could have spread it to others who are asymptomatic and could spread it to you.   With masks and distancing, that's still unlikely but maybe avoiding the store for a couple of weeks and watching the outbreak information on the CDPHE website, makes sense to me.
April Link from the string above, it sounds like the one downtown.  There are 8 cases of Covid positive staff as of May 12.  The Colorado department of health outbreak information just says King Soopers, Denver.  I wish they would have a little more transparency.

As a nurse on the front line I see alit if unsafe behavior in public . people should avoid gloves. They are not sterile, actually spread germs if you don‚Äôt remove them ie when you touch the keypads, dig into your purse and climb into your car. Use sanitizer or was them hands.  Yes they should be wearing non n95 masks which are being diverted to the frontline workers.
Fellow nurse here. YES AND YES>  The virus is not absorbed through the skin on your hands. Gloves are also designed as one time use only, for a patient procedure and then discarded and hands should then be washed. I'm seeing people wearing them in stores etc throughout their trip. Because of the 'sticky' nature of the material they are actually shown to attract viruses etc and are less safe than your hands. God forbid you touch your face while wearing them! Just use hand sanitizer or wash your hands as soon as you are able and try not to touch your face until you can do that. . I would be very unhappy to see a single pair of gloves being worn all day in the stores by employees....it's bad enough seeing customers wearing them. Yes to cotton masks for everyone.(edited)
I agree...
Same with Safeway in lowry including the Starbucks in Safeway in lowry. When asked the other day they said wearing gloves was optional.
No no... I would not get a drink from that Starbucks.
And I didn't even know that Starbucks is an essential service. Learn something every day.
Say what you want about Whole Foods but I‚Äôve witnessed them wiping down food in cans and boxes before putting on shelves as well as all employees wearing masks and gloves. Very different experience than Safeway.
And I also find Marczyk's to be commendable! I have an excellent sense of smell, & I was getting a very faint whiff of ""Clorox"" at the refrigerated cases, down each aisle, etc. Was there yesterday---everybody masked, baskets wiped, sneeze-guards @ checkout, etc.
Quite commendable. I generally shop Safeway but lately they don't seem to be stocking their shelves to have things available even first thing in the mornings and have been out of most of what I am going shopping to get. I've had to develop work-arounds and find alternative sources for things I need.
I also have had to stop people from handing me receipts with their gloves on after touching many peoples stuff and money ahead of me
Went today and employees had mask on though out the store  King Soopers(edited)
When I was at Safeway on Quebec last week, there were no wipes by the grocery carts in either dispenser. I had to ask for them to be filled. And I received attitude when I asked. And this was first thing in the morning. I guess everyone is stressed out a whole bunch.

Safeway on Krameria had toilet paper this morning
I saw toilet paper, tissue, breads, cereals, napkins, etc at Target. I was there today around 7:20am.
Home Depot has TP.
Safeway has toilet paper  in Lowery.
If you get desperate, I can loan you a couple of rolls.
Nancy, i asked at Target in Glendale about hand sanitizer and was told they receive shipments every single night with sanitizer and TP. They open at 7am and it is sold out by 9am. So get to Target when they open.
I would befriend some grocery store worker. Ask them to get you some. Slip them a 20. Password is flush.
Thank you for all these helpful posts. It seems that we need to be in the stores when they open to get T paper as it is gone in a few hours. (or minutes) Will keep after it but no wonder it goes so fast.  Hoarding begets hoarding.
I ordered this from Johnstown paper company in PA. Takes 5-7 business days. The money is used to clean up the town.
How did you learn to do so? I am willing to help out.
Thanks for the tip I will try them Plus I had a neighbor drop off a few rolls People can be so wonderful and kind. Who'd of thought toilet paper (and many other small  needs) would bring us together. (:
The Walmart on Quebec Street has toilet paper. You have to go to the back of the store and request it. They have it separate from everything else. Good luck also Walgreens have their truck delivery on Wednesday at noon and they have toilet tissue there after. Good luck to you!
I have had luck at Soopers on Leetsdale and Target but you need to get there by 9:30 am. I do not think that stores restock during the day.(edited)
I have heard that the stores in the suburbs are more likely to have TP.
Target on Colorado this morning had plenty.
Toilet paper is at Walmart in Stapleton right now 2:30 pm
I have issues getting tp in the mornings since I‚Äôm still working. I do have a Sam‚Äôs membership, and they‚Äôve recently restocked their TP and have plenty, even in the evening. If you get desperate and need a pack, I can get you one.
Chocolate lab has tp
Try Western Paper Distributors at Havana and I-70.  They normally sell to businesses but they've made stock available to individuals.

Take a look at Impact Denver.  They feed and cloth the homeless.  They also have a free store that the homeless can come an shop for an outfit.  Wonderful group.  They even have a Santa gift giving party. My good friend brings her daughter.  It‚Äôs a wonderful family event.

My wife and I have done Meals on Wheels around the Holidays with our little ones in years past. They always seem to be happy to have volunteers to give their usual drivers a break this time of year.

So it‚Äôs nice to pay it back, if only a little.
Not sure what u would really like to do but at Christmas many organizations give dinners and food away to the homeless, that might be a little frightening. One year my church was doing meals for the homeless in civic center park I took my teenage daughter to help with the process. It is good to teach our children to not be on the receiving end all the time but to learn how to give as well, it is a lesson that adults need to learn as well, I commend you for even thinking about exposing ur child at such a young age, we hear about children on the news creating ways to help others, it amazes me but I know those parents are so proud. I don‚Äôt really know of anything for such a young age, but u r awesome for even wanting to expose ur chip to giving at such a young age. It really goes a long way as they get older.
By the way my daughter I took to volunteer with me is a CNA, and that is truly a job that requires u to give a lot of you, honestly more than I could, working and taking care of combative alztimers patients at the least and she said she likes her job which is a hard thing for a lot of people to say.

273,424,424,154319803,City of Denver,,9 Jul,"Extra Trash Collection Changing to 8-Week Schedule. DOTI is making adjustments to its extra trash collection service that go into effect next week. As Denver households continue to set out more extra trash amid COVID-19 safer at home guidance, DOTI is needing to create smaller collection routes to meet daily demand.

In creating four (4) additional extra trash collection routes for a total of eight (8), we move to an eight (8) week extra trash collection schedule and increase our capacity to collect the extra trash our customers are setting out and meet their expectations.  

Here are additional resources we hope are helpful: 
‚Ä¢ Residents can go to www.denvergov.org/trash to access their waste collection schedules, sign up for alerts and reminders, and download our app to keep track of their upcoming extra trash collection days.
‚Ä¢ Customers that can‚Äôt wait until their next extra trash collection service day can find on the city‚Äôs website, listings of licensed waste haulers and private drop-off facilities for excess trash, where fees apply. https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/trash-and-recycling/trash-collection/ETC.html",collection change 8-week schedule make adjustment extra trash collection service effect week household continue set extra trash safe home guidance need create small collection route meet daily demand create additional extra trash collection route total 8) week extra trash collection schedule increase capacity collect extra trash customer set meet expectation additional resource hope helpful ‚Ä¢ resident access waste collection schedule sign alert reminder download app track upcoming extra trash collection day ‚Ä¢ customer wait extra trash collection service day find city website listing licensed waste hauler private drop facility excess trash fee apply,"direct link to a more readable map/calendar/instructions for Extra Trash:

I see 5 is niw GVR!
But now they are collecting large items half as often :/ How does this help with the increase?
Budget cuts. We pay the price.
Yea that makes sense.... higher demand so lets make you wait double the time! People already dump trash in unauthorized areas due to lack of pickups
I agree, it makes perfect sense. It takes them longer to pick up more stuff with the current resources.
Really disappointing. More trash yet less collections. This will increase litter and give people more time to rummage through everyone's excess.
I just tried looking at the calendar and i dont see a pickup anywhere, i looked through December
Ditto!
recycle people recycle -
I have 2 recycling bins! Im thinking of getting a third. But we still have items that dont fit in trash or recycle ‚ôªÔ∏è
I may be thick in the head, but I can't make heads or tails of that map.  Is it possible to go back to the former way of inserting your home address and getting the calendar with the date?
Sally H. you can still do that, but the calendar won't be updated until the end of the week (according to a note hidden down the page) ‚Äî click ""View my collection schedule"" on the page the city linked, or use this direct link:
what they seem to be saying is that much more trash means the crews can't cover as much of the city in a day; there's no money to hire more crews and buy more trucks, so they've had to make the routes shorter; that means it takes longer before they can get back to each neighborhood(edited)
A lot of residents put things out for extra trash that can legitimately be donated. I just saw a neighbor discard a fridge (Xcel pays up to $75 for your old fridge in any condition) and bookshelves, that Goodwill or ARC would have accepted. Just because the city is willing to pick it up doesn't mean it makes sense to send it to the landfill.
My neighborhood arc and goodwill wont come pick items up.
The city created this problem when they took away the dumpsters. It takes more man hours to visit every single home than it did to dump four or five dumpsters in each block. And then on top of that they have to add extra work by adding the extra Trash crew.(edited)
But not all areas had those dumpsters.
I can understand why the City is doing this from a budget perspective, but it is only going to result in more illegal trash dumping.
Now we get to see longer periods of trash dumped in the alley.  How about extra trash can‚Äôt be placed in alley until week of  pickup?
That‚Äôs already a rule
Maybe im just crazy but i can not figure out when our new pick up day is?!?!?!?! 4Th and Elati

Well this sucks 'more demand, less service.....
It's VERY frustrating for those of us who take the time to put the LIP dates on our calendars that you published the announcement the week of our scheduled LIP that was actually happened the PREVIOUS week and now it won't come again for EIGHT WEEKS. That's actually 13 WEEKS of no LIP. Almost 1/4 of the year at a time when many of us have yard debris.
I‚Äôm sure once they iron it out, a simple call to 311 and you‚Äôll get your schedule. 
I agree it's pretty frustrating. It's been 5 weeks and I thought that they'd be picking up tomorrow but the website reads that now my address won't happen for another 8 weeks? So if it's supposed to start next week, why isn't it happening THIS week, Ms. Burke? Also, they missed my trash and recycling last week and I've submitted a ticket 3x with no response....
Same thing happened to me.  I complained to DOTI and Candi Di Baca on City Council, but no response yet.
According to this, the large item pickup schedule is to be adjusted starting NEXT week. So then why won't there be large item pickup tomorrow (7/10) as per the original schedule?
That is my question too :)  https://www.denvergov.org/pocketgov/#/mySchedules/trash
There will be Extra trash pickup this week if scheduled previously. Mine was today and they picked up. 311 said this week‚Äôs schedule is still good. Just not showing on website. I was confused too.  Change begins next week. Not sure why they took last week and this week‚Äôs schedule off the website-made it more confusing.
I get the weekly email reminder of what will be picked up, and the one I received today made no mention of extra trash, even though 7/10 is the scheduled date for my neighborhood. It just listed regular trash and compost.
I have gone to the denver.org/trash and CANNOT get an extra trash recycle date for myself.  It is not on the calendar at all and when i  go to the icon for extra trash on the right hand side, the link for 'my schedule in the first  few lines does not have a schedule with ETC dates on it.  I can't figure out this silly map either.  We need to be able to put in our address and find out our dates or you are going to have a bunch of extra trash our when it shouldn't be!

Two households at most is my current understanding. Maybe consider going virtual (maybe with a fun recipe switch idea) so that everyone will be around to share the next one! Be well.
Just live your life.  COVID is not going away.  Remember 99.8% recovery rate.
Unbelievable
We are struggling with the same problem.  If everyone can quarantine for the two weeks prior, it's probably OK.  Add a rapid test a day or two before, even better.  Anyone who cannot do those things should not attend.
Follow the rules. Gatherings of no more than five is the maximum currently allowed, and if things keep up at the current pace will be lower by Thanksgiving(edited)
into your heart it will creep
starts when you're always alone
what are you so afraid of ?
Killing immune compromised family who have just as much of a right to exist as you do.

You ok there...Edgar?
For What It's Worth, yes
stop now..what's that sound
everybody look what's goin round
The city says you can‚Äôt have more than 5 people now. So I would say, ‚Äúpump the breaks‚Äù.
üòÖüòÖ  Ridiculous.
Marisa Baldwin and you're not qualified to make that statement
Just found out today that some friends of ours had a family gathering, everyone ended up testing positive today.  Many have pre-existing conditions.
I have a family friend that just flew on a small private plane to Nebraska for bird hunting one of the passengers was positive when they left all eight person on the flight and their significant others now have COVID. Some have symptoms, some don‚Äôt, but they all get to quarantine for 14 days. That means no one gets to leave their homes for two weeks. Why would you even consider having such a party. It‚Äôs just Thanksgiving.
In their pockets
I‚Äôm a nurse on the covid floor, beds are filling up fast, and younger and younger people are heading to the ICU.   Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday, I will miss having my family around the table but not worth the risk!  Unfortunately I will not be having dinner with my children and spouses.  Out of love for them and my work family.  Stay safe .
Thank you Sharon for all your hard work.  It must be so insulting to hear from all the disbelievers .Gee-does anyone think they cancelled the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, St Patrick's Day parade and the Stock Show for nothing?  All the concerts and Movies.  Restaurants closed? people laid off? Some people going hungry? Afraid of losing their housing?  I'm still amazed that there are disbelievers and somewhat pissed off that they would attack someone who would save their life regardless. You are a hero and many other essentials as well. 
Just kidding, they all were wearing masks. That‚Äôs why they thought it would be fine sharing a tin can for an hour to go bird hunting.
5 people. Same family. That's what Dr. Fauci said.
Penny Smith it‚Äôs extremely hard to hear the crap .. when I‚Äôm putting myself at risk, and having to come home each night after I arrange hospice service for so many families.  My heart breaks over and over.
We are out here, Sharon, we just aren‚Äôt as loud and we don‚Äôt have time to taunt and smear online. But please know - we are here, masked up, distancing and thanking you every day

In places where masks are required - and people do it - the covid rates drop.  Look it up if you don‚Äôt believe what mask proponents are saying. You could even look at numbers on mask wearing from Europe or anywhere if you don‚Äôt trust our news. And when you decide EACH time you go out to wear a mask, think of not only the overwhelmed healthcare workers, but think of your community. If we all wear masks, we can do everything we can for our small businesses.  They can‚Äôt survive much more, if they are even still around. Wear your mask so they can stay open. Wear your mask to protect your neighbor and business owner. Wear your mask so you CAN go back to your favorite shops.

","Thanksgiving entertaining. Just wondering what the general consensus is about large (15 or 16) family groups coming together for Thanksgiving dinner.  If we jump to a ""stay at home"" order again, I would cancel.Not recommended. Likely to infect a guest or two. Is it worth the risk to all?
Two households at most is my current understanding. Maybe consider going virtual (maybe with a fun recipe switch idea) so that everyone will be around to share the next one! Be well.
Just live your life.  COVID is not going away.  Remember 99.8% recovery rate.
Unbelievable
We are struggling with the same problem.  If everyone can quarantine for the two weeks prior, it's probably OK.  Add a rapid test a day or two before, even better.  Anyone who cannot do those things should not attend.
Follow the rules. Gatherings of no more than five is the maximum currently allowed, and if things keep up at the current pace will be lower by Thanksgiving(edited)
into your heart it will creep
starts when you're always alone
what are you so afraid of ?
Killing immune compromised family who have just as much of a right to exist as you do.
step out of line, the Man come and take you away
You ok there...Edgar?
For What It's Worth, yes
stop now..what's that sound
everybody look what's goin round
The city says you can‚Äôt have more than 5 people now. So I would say, ‚Äúpump the breaks‚Äù.
üòÖüòÖ  Ridiculous.
Marisa Baldwin and you're not qualified to make that statement
Just found out today that some friends of ours had a family gathering, everyone ended up testing positive today.  Many have pre-existing conditions.
I have a family friend that just flew on a small private plane to Nebraska for bird hunting one of the passengers was positive when they left all eight person on the flight and their significant others now have COVID. Some have symptoms, some don‚Äôt, but they all get to quarantine for 14 days. That means no one gets to leave their homes for two weeks. Why would you even consider having such a party. It‚Äôs just Thanksgiving.
In their pockets
I‚Äôm a nurse on the covid floor, beds are filling up fast, and younger and younger people are heading to the ICU.   Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday, I will miss having my family around the table but not worth the risk!  Unfortunately I will not be having dinner with my children and spouses.  Out of love for them and my work family.  Stay safe .
Thank you Sharon for all your hard work.  It must be so insulting to hear from all the disbelievers .Gee-does anyone think they cancelled the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, St Patrick's Day parade and the Stock Show for nothing?  All the concerts and Movies.  Restaurants closed? people laid off? Some people going hungry? Afraid of losing their housing?  I'm still amazed that there are disbelievers and somewhat pissed off that they would attack someone who would save their life regardless. You are a hero and many other essentials as well. 
Just kidding, they all were wearing masks. That‚Äôs why they thought it would be fine sharing a tin can for an hour to go bird hunting.
5 people. Same family. That's what Dr. Fauci said.
Penny Smith it‚Äôs extremely hard to hear the crap .. when I‚Äôm putting myself at risk, and having to come home each night after I arrange hospice service for so many families.  My heart breaks over and over.
We are out here, Sharon, we just aren‚Äôt as loud and we don‚Äôt have time to taunt and smear online. But please know - we are here, masked up, distancing and thanking you every day
There is no way I would consider having a gathering of that size! Yikes!

282,433,433,139619446,City of Denver,,6 Mar 20,"COVID-19 City of Denver Update. The Mayor and the City and County of Denver are taking the threat of COVID-19, also known as the novel coronavirus, very seriously. This week, Mayor Hancock directed the formation of a task force to coordinate efforts to protect and prepare our city, and all of you, for potential cases of COVID-19. 

This work is led by the Department of Public Health & Environment and the Office of Emergency Management. These agencies are coordinating planning and resources with local schools, shelters, public facilities, medical providers, Denver International Airport and other partners. The Mayor has also directed the Department of General Services to begin the installation of sanitation stations in public city facilities and recreation centers. 

 We can all play a role in preventing the contraction and spread of this virus. 

¬∑         Wash your hands often, vigorously, for 20-seconds with soap and water. 

¬∑         Cover your nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing 

¬∑         If you have symptoms of flu, a cold or fever, stay home.

Funny how a Propaganda Virus spreading to Colorado happens when Federal Funding got cut
Isn't it!! More people have died from snake bites this year. Corona virus has been around since the 1960s. MARS and SARS are both corona viruses . I don't remember during those outbreaks. People act like sheep anymore the news said it so it must be true!
we can thank you know who for cutting the finds.
What funds?
Not funds, Valerie, the finds.  I don't know what Voldemort (does anyone really say ""you know who"" anymore?) found, but it must be big
Sounds like regular FLU season ... wash hands and don‚Äôt touch things
I work for Raytheon and they are taking it very seriously.  (14 day quarantine for all travel to the effected countries).
High density housing is only going to add to the problem.
Love how they will take a Single Person with Maybe and bring them from Summit Co to the Most Populated Area, Denver ... nope, not trying to spread ...
How much did this new task force cost, is it a new force, didn‚Äôt you already for have a force ...... .
The process is there but it's most cost efficient to only activate the force when needed. Duh.
make rent free until its done so we can stay home
Are you saying b/c of cold/flu season you should get rent free ????
Public sanitation stations huh??? Interesting... wonder how that's going to work why dident we do this for the regulare flue? Just wash your hands ppl! The only thing killing ppl is poor hygiene and panic over a flue, oh and Colorado's rent prices that's the real epidemic!(edited)
This isn't the flu.
This week!! He should of formed a task force weeks ago.
Drop the ban on pit bulls!
Here‚Äôs a novel idea Mr. Hancock. Rather than spending money on making up a task force, and doing all these ridiculous things, why not simply purchase and make available lots of sanitizer and wipes and soap?  there!  IJust save you a bunch of money!  Now please give me a chunk of the change that you would‚Äôve spent on a task force :-)
That is exactly what having stations in rec centers and gov buildings means.  Did you even read the post?
Interestingly, the state of NY is making their own hand sanitizer (I think prisoners were already making something similar) and using it for all the state institutions.  This helps everyone, though, because now that state and all its agencies, prisons, hospitals, etc will not be competed with citizens for hand sanitizer on the open market.
Thank goodness our city and state has a plan! Our medical providers have a plan. We aren't experiencing shortages. We don't have a blizzard to contend with at this time. So we're good.
Oh, she ‚Äúwas joking.‚Äù üò´Funny thing I don‚Äôt share her sense of humor.
WHY THE RUN ON TOILET PAPER DO YOU SHIT MORE WHEN YOU GET THE VIRUS
Possibly so in Centennial. Kings shelves were empty, Westminster Kings had plenty.  Go figure?
Where can I buy stock for the antiviral inoculations which will be available next season? Anyone? The Pharmacy Corps are making Billions alone on all Flu üò∑ cough, masks and all the other necessities! Incredible! I understand it‚Äôs a serious problem but really? It‚Äôs Allergy season.. come on!
Just a simple question for the mayor. He talks about now setting up ‚Äúsanitary stations‚Äù across Denver, especially in public buildings. So...great. But wait one minute. You see, Denver has this other major problem that no one including the city council and the mayor want to seriously address...its called the homeless population. Trash and needles scattered all over the sidewalks, tent cities with rats, deification at residences and storefronts, including the 16th street mall. How is this not a more immediate, serious threat to public health than this virus. How would you like to be a resident close to downtown or a business owner that has to power wash their storefront every morning before they open for business. Btw, the cities answer to helping these folks is fining them if they don‚Äôt clean the feces and garbage up.
Ms. Marchetta - thank you for posting this update.
Are we still going to spend $100,000s of thousands to round up geese and kill them this spring???
Welcome news that the city of Denver is getting woke to this!  I hope they incorporate adequate city-wide testing and publish locations (perhaps not exact) of positive tested cases so we have a better sense of our risks in public locally.
Yes! Because if you don‚Äôt look out for a known problem like this, it will find you!

Great photo.  Hopefully it will be sufficiently clear to lead to an arrest.  Thanks for being such a caring neighbor!!!
I have to say I am honestly concerned about Cherry Creek North and Congress Park.  This is only one woman at this time.  What happens when low income housing and homeless shelters are built on the  North side of Congress Park.  There is more to come neighbors.  This will also eventually effect our property values.  Again, one of more to come.  Soon there will be groups.  And yes, looking at other options.  My best to all during this upcoming transition.
Robin Wells Thanks Robin!  Guess I should be glad the defender of property values didn't use terms like ""vermin"" or ""white trash"".

Stupid--bright red jacket--should be wearing ORANGE, the new black...
Did you send this to the police? They can‚Äôt see Nextdoor posts.
Send it to the police.
Wow, thank you for the warning. Maybe it was a love letter to her lover and she changed her mind üòÇ and went back to retrieve it.
I agree with Herb. They should be thrown in jail. Absolutely disgusting.
Not sure it was the same woman, but someone was also skulking around our front gate this morning at about the same time (Adams between 4th and 5th).  Unfortunately no pic.
This photo and some of the others I've seen lately indicate that Porch Pirates are not necessarily homeless people or vagrants.  In addition to the individuals who do this routinely, I'm guessing there are people who do this type of thing when the opportunity presents itself.  Maybe the package size fits into their backpack or maybe the labeling on the box gives a clue to what's inside.  Thank you Ruth McIntyre for your diligence.  This is what our Neighborhood Watch program is all about.
Thank you Ruth for taking charge of the situation!!!!! I appreciate you!

285,436,436,145523311,John Sadwith,Crestmoor/Mayfair Park,21 Apr 20,"Jeff Stone at Paris Automotive and Tires. I know that everyone has their favorite automotive repair place but I want to give a shout out to Paris Automotive and Tire at Leetsdale and Oneida.  Jim Paris, at one time, had several stores but after he passed away most closed, but the family sold this one to Jeff Stone, the manager at the time.  I have known Jeff from taking my cars into him when he worked at a Michelin place on Bannock St. in the late 70's.  Jeff then worked for Jim Paris at the current location and bought it many years ago.  He has stayed open and applied for a small business loan as soon as they were available but still was too late as the money ran out.  There is not a more honest, personable, capable, person out there, no matter what you think of your person.  One time I had an issue with some part and it was out of warranty.  Jeff sent me a check to reimburse me notwithstanding that he owed me nothing.  He knows all his customers by first name and always has a smile. He needs your work now.  Few people are driving so when the stay at home order expires, no one will need oil changes, new tires and other automotive repairs (he does almost everything not just tires) for some time.  Please think of Jeff and his loyal employees-- he is paying them, and somehow keeping them working, albeit little business and he doesn't expect business to pick up for some time.  Please support your local independent business person and not the chains.  If you tell Jeff I referred you, I will get nothing, you will get great service with no discount and maybe even a higher bill because you know me.  There is no other business I have ever given as much money to over the years and felt good about it.  Please don't tell him that or he will end up owning my first born son.",know favorite automotive repair place want shout time store pass closed family sell manager time know take car work place late work current location buy year ago stay open apply small business loan soon available late money run honest personable capable person matter think person time issue warranty send check reimburse owe know customer smile need work people drive stay home order expire need oil change new tire automotive repair tire time think loyal employees-- pay keep work little business expect business pick time support local independent business person chain tell refer great service discount maybe high bill know business give money year feel good tell end own bear son,"All - I am the General Manger of John Elway Chevrolet in Eglewood.

Of course we will treat Anyone and Everyone fairly regardless of what you do !
This is very disrespectful to the original post. You work for a multi millionaire company when someone is trying to keep a local company alive. That company you're touting isn't even in this neighborhood. I've worked for multiple dealers in my life and all they care about is the bottom line probably just like you do. Are you going to miss out on your bonus?
I love them and always take my cars to them for repairs
Completely agree, Jeff is a class act.  My father was a mechanic and if it wasn‚Äôt something he could fix he always took his car to Jeff.  I‚Äôve been going to him myself since HS and to this day he still remembers me when I walk in.  Thanks for supporting him and this post!
I went to them forever!  Then I had to stop driving.  Best place in town. Always honest & on time.
Could not have said it better about Jeff and his crew at Paris Tire.  Moved here 16 years ago and two unrelated people told me I had to go to Jeff.  He's taken great care of four of my cars, and helped me in other, less concrete ways: he's just a good guy to be around.  South side of Leetsdale, just past Springbrooke Home, just before light at Oneida.  They're the best.
Hijacking someone‚Äôs post to advertise is a pretty shitty thing to do.
Yes!
Monica Geocaris I would imagine that Jeffrey Silverberg has a multi million dollar advertising budget over there with Elway. He chooses to advertise on ND on a post that is giving a shout out to a small local business. That is quite the slime ball move.

Jeff and his crew have been helping our family for well over 20 years.
I am one of the owners of Automotive Search.  We have Jeff inspect all our used cars before we even decide to keep for sale. His opinion is worth his weight in gold.  We ALWAYS refer our friends, family and clients to Jeff.  Never a better or honest guy!!
Automotive Search is an Auto Broker.  We recently purchased a car through them because the dealer was being unreasonable, not price wise but procedure wise.  This was over the holidays and we found a car we liked but couldn't get the bank work done until the next Monday (this was a Friday).  We asked the dealer to hold the used car and they declined even after I offered a deposit.  Automotive Search got possession of the car within one hour and held it for me until I could get the money transferred from one bank to another.  They washed the car and had some missing things located and installed.  They were a delight to work with. We had great service and this is another small business to consider patronizing if you are looking for a new or used car.  Thanks Debi and all for your comments about Jeff.  What a stand up person he is!!
We have been taking our vehicles to Jeff for about 20 years. Our three adult children now take their vehicles to him.  He is honest and his crew at Paris tire do a great job!
I agree with all of the others who have recommended Jeff‚Äî‚ÄîI also have been taking our cars to him for over 25 years.   Please give him some business
Thank you! Good to know. I need some stuff done on my car and didn't want to have to spend $$$$$$$ at the dealership.
All stars ! They are honest, provide quality service and  fair prices!  Nice to know there are still some people who care about the work they do.(edited)

We've been going to Jeff's Paris Automotive for years. I can't say enough great things about him and his crew!
I have gone there for many years and love them!
Went there one time because my engine light was on. Charged me $121.16 then told me that I would have to pay over $2k for repairs. When I said I would take the car somewhere else, lowered the price to $1650. I took the car to another repair shop and there was nothing wrong. The other repair shop did not even charge me and the engine light was on due to cable from rodents which they fixed for free. Don't agree with you. I would never take my car there and I think I should report this. What do you cheerleaders think?
I‚Äôve been going to Jeff since 1988 and couldn‚Äôt agree more. He‚Äôs just awesome!
","Jeff Stone at Paris Automotive and Tires. I know that everyone has their favorite automotive repair place but I want to give a shout out to Paris Automotive and Tire at Leetsdale and Oneida.  Jim Paris, at one time, had several stores but after he passed away most closed, but the family sold this one to Jeff Stone, the manager at the time.  I have known Jeff from taking my cars into him when he worked at a Michelin place on Bannock St. in the late 70's.  Jeff then worked for Jim Paris at the current location and bought it many years ago.  He has stayed open and applied for a small business loan as soon as they were available but still was too late as the money ran out.  There is not a more honest, personable, capable, person out there, no matter what you think of your person.  One time I had an issue with some part and it was out of warranty.  Jeff sent me a check to reimburse me notwithstanding that he owed me nothing.  He knows all his customers by first name and always has a smile. He needs your work now.  Few people are driving so when the stay at home order expires, no one will need oil changes, new tires and other automotive repairs (he does almost everything not just tires) for some time.  Please think of Jeff and his loyal employees-- he is paying them, and somehow keeping them working, albeit little business and he doesn't expect business to pick up for some time.  Please support your local independent business person and not the chains.  If you tell Jeff I referred you, I will get nothing, you will get great service with no discount and maybe even a higher bill because you know me.  There is no other business I have ever given as much money to over the years and felt good about it.  Please don't tell him that or he will end up owning my first born son.All - I am the General Manger of John Elway Chevrolet in Eglewood.  I live in Crestmoor.  We are offering free oil changes to all first responders.   Please take me up on this if you are a first responder.    Of course we will treat Anyone and Everyone fairly regardless of what you do !
This is very disrespectful to the original post. You work for a multi millionaire company when someone is trying to keep a local company alive. That company you're touting isn't even in this neighborhood. I've worked for multiple dealers in my life and all they care about is the bottom line probably just like you do. Are you going to miss out on your bonus?
I love them and always take my cars to them for repairs
Completely agree, Jeff is a class act.  My father was a mechanic and if it wasn‚Äôt something he could fix he always took his car to Jeff.  I‚Äôve been going to him myself since HS and to this day he still remembers me when I walk in.  Thanks for supporting him and this post!
I went to them forever!  Then I had to stop driving.  Best place in town. Always honest & on time.
Could not have said it better about Jeff and his crew at Paris Tire.  Moved here 16 years ago and two unrelated people told me I had to go to Jeff.  He's taken great care of four of my cars, and helped me in other, less concrete ways: he's just a good guy to be around.  South side of Leetsdale, just past Springbrooke Home, just before light at Oneida.  They're the best.
Hijacking someone‚Äôs post to advertise is a pretty shitty thing to do.
Yes!
Monica Geocaris I would imagine that Jeffrey Silverberg has a multi million dollar advertising budget over there with Elway. He chooses to advertise on ND on a post that is giving a shout out to a small local business. That is quite the slime ball move.

Nathaniel Millard Great, thank you!
Hello Nathaniel, you may have already done so, but please reach out to the property owners before doing a rent strike. (Sorry if I‚Äôm misunderstanding your intended meaning.) There is assistance available from the IRS and local government. A combination of help and reduced rent is far better than a rent strike. The mortgage and utilities on the property still have to be paid. So sorry you are out of work! We‚Äôre all in a tough spot! 
Clare, thanks for highlighting.  it's both prudent and fair to tell your landlord you wont be paying rent so they can seek assistance from the government.
Just don't pay it.  There are no evictions right now.  What's up with all the social categorization of yourself and all these people that you think you need to help?  If you have to make a choice between rent and food.  Feed yourself.  Nobody needs social martyrs right now.  Privilege is believing that you need to be someone's savior.
Horrible advice. Colorado is a very strong landlord and property rights state. There are already lawyers lining  up at the courthouse doors demanding access to the courts. The governor nor the legislature has the power to close the courts. We are a co-equal tricameral government. The courts will reopen soon and evictions will be right back on the dockets.
Hey Nathaniel,
here is a guide from a tenant advocate, the best resource ive seen...
Talk to your landlord and make arrangements. That is the adult thing to do. Don't create animosity and bad karma, you don't need that. A lot of people are in the same boat.
Hey Nathaniel!! I live in one of the buildings managed by Rio and reached out on the 1st about not being able to pay rent (am in a similar situation- a queer service industry worker) and they were pretty responsive and sent out a list of resources and were very clear that they would not be enforcing late fees, as it is against the law right now to do so. I would suggest asking for your property mangers list of resources if you haven‚Äôt already. I still have not paid and have been looking into the resources, while it is a lengthy process to apply for most, Rio has been patient and kind throughout. Hope this helps, best of luck.
Just for clarification: this isn‚Äôt a post made for anything other than opening a venue for individuals with concerns to reach out, this isn‚Äôt a call to action, and this isn‚Äôt about the ethics of land ownership/property management.
It seems manipulative to use sexuality as some sort of privileged or loop hole unless I'm not understanding something.(edited)
I would write them and explain your situation. Sexual orientation should be left out. KEEP your correspondence and see what happens.
I don‚Äôt know much about that management company, but I do know there are a few rental assistance programs in Denver. TRUA Is in the 80220 neighborhood. They cover up to 80% of your rent.
Hi Nathaniel, 
Thank you for using white male privilege to speak up! üôèüèª.
Jewel- pathetic to offer that advice. It puts homeowners/commercial real estate investors at risk of losing their homes - they have mortgages to pay. Sexual orientation should have nothing to do with this...(edited)
making people accept the consequences of the financial risk they assumed...the horror
I am a landlord. Wish I could just not have my tenants pay but the mortgage is still due. But there is a buffer in rent to cover anything that breaks, repairs etc. Maybe tenants for individual landlords can ask them to just pay the actual mortgage until this is over and not the buffer amount. Landlords get a bad wrap but plenty are understanding and hopefully have some wiggle room. Not too much wiggle room cause that means they are charging too much rent üòâ.
Anita, have you applied for any govt assistance?
So for my tenant who paid less than half of her rent this month, we offered to gift her half of her deposit back to try to get her back on her feet. She is super neat and no pets. Her deposit is her money and not earning any interest so we gifted it back as a credit. My concern here, is that tenants don‚Äôt realize that we have a mortgage and bills to pay, not to mention Denver taxes. Not asking for sympathy, merely to educate tenants.
i think most tenants get that.  but when faced with the decision between food and keeping someone's investment in the black, there is an obvious choice.
When you have a mortgage..
Whether or not things in your building get to the point where a strike is possible, it's always good to organize your building.  If you're curious, there was a good intro to tenant organizing put together by People's Action that can be found here: https://youtu.be/1IJWEjVpzgU 
During this time, too, the CARES act allows for a minimum 180 days of forbearance on mortgages purchased through a federal program (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, etc) & a moratorium on foreclosures.  If you know any friends of friends of friends in real estate, ask them to do you a favor and look up the mortgage info on your property OWNER.  If they're granted forebearance, they can't charge any fees or rents to the tenants.
I find your comment about ""white privilege"" to be racist and genderist. What is with you lefties? Judging people by race or gender is okay so long as the race is white and the gender is male. NO.
i mean, as a group, we are the most destructive force in human history.
And furthermore!  If you can't pay your rent, how are able to help others who can't pay their rent.  The impoverished do not pull people from poverty
I work in an industry where I live on Tips as well, and pay high rent for a one bedroom. 
I understand CJ. But it won‚Äôt do any good to contribute to the bankruptcy of a small time landlord. I am not one and have no bias. Banks punish small landlords with a vengeance that does not apply to the big guys. As usual, when there is massive pain, conversation and mutual empathy is more important than ‚Äúrent strikes‚Äù or other unilateral destructive actions. We are in this together; jobs are available; assistance is available; civility and mutual respect will win out.
The big landlords are entirely different from the small fry. The later are as squeezed as anyone else and are dependent on the banks giving them some relief from their mortgage.
Kevin, we're talking about tenants with no job, no savings...and with every day that goes by, less hope.  this is largely not the case for landlords of any size
Hey Nathaniel - I strongly recommend you talk to your managers.  I happen to know the owners of Rio well and they are incredibly nice and accommodating people.  They know everyone is struggling and will help - they are not going to target you or come after you for being in an adverse position.  Believe it or not, the vast majority of landlords are decent and reasonable people.

But there is a buffer in rent to cover anything that breaks, repairs etc. Maybe tenants for individual landlords can ask them to just pay the actual mortgage until this is over and not the buffer amount. Landlords get a bad wrap but plenty are understanding and hopefully have some wiggle room. Not too much wiggle room cause that means they are charging too much rent üòâ.
Anita, have you applied for any govt assistance?
So for my tenant who paid less than half of her rent this month, we offered to gift her half of her deposit back to try to get her back on her feet. She is super neat and no pets. Her deposit is her money and not earning any interest so we gifted it back as a credit. My concern here, is that tenants don‚Äôt realize that we have a mortgage and bills to pay, not to mention Denver taxes. Not asking for sympathy, merely to educate tenants.
i think most tenants get that.  but when faced with the decision between food and keeping someone's investment in the black, there is an obvious choice.
When you have a mortgage..
Whether or not things in your building get to the point where a strike is possible, it's always good to organize your building.  If you're curious, there was a good intro to tenant organizing put together by People's Action that can be found here: https://youtu.be/1IJWEjVpzgU 
During this time, too, the CARES act allows for a minimum 180 days of forbearance on mortgages purchased through a federal program (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, etc) & a moratorium on foreclosures.  If you know any friends of friends of friends in real estate, ask them to do you a favor and look up the mortgage info on your property OWNER.  If they're granted forebearance, they can't charge any fees or rents to the tenants.
I find your comment about ""white privilege"" to be racist and genderist. What is with you lefties? Judging people by race or gender is okay so long as the race is white and the gender is male. NO.
i mean, as a group, we are the most destructive force in human history.
And furthermore!  If you can't pay your rent, how are able to help others who can't pay their rent.  The impoverished do not pull people from poverty
I work in an industry where I live on Tips as well, and pay high rent for a one bedroom. 
I understand CJ. But it won‚Äôt do any good to contribute to the bankruptcy of a small time landlord. I am not one and have no bias. Banks punish small landlords with a vengeance that does not apply to the big guys. As usual, when there is massive pain, conversation and mutual empathy is more important than ‚Äúrent strikes‚Äù or other unilateral destructive actions. We are in this together; jobs are available; assistance is available; civility and mutual respect will win out.
The big landlords are entirely different from the small fry. The later are as squeezed as anyone else and are dependent on the banks giving them some relief from their mortgage.
Kevin, we're talking about tenants with no job, no savings...and with every day that goes by, less hope.  this is largely not the case for landlords of any size
Hey Nathaniel - I strongly recommend you talk to your managers.  I happen to know the owners of Rio well and they are incredibly nice and accommodating people.  They know everyone is struggling and will help - they are not going to target you or come after you for being in an adverse position.  Believe it or not, the vast majority of landlords are decent and reasonable people.  
Rio cancelling rent for how many months exactly?

Awesome!!! Glad your back and pray for your Health!
Hi Steve!  I'm happy to help, too!  Looks like you got a lot of offers.  Glad you're home safe!
Thanks Josh. I appreciate it. Hopefully, will be able to take care of myself in a few days. then i will volunteer to others . Great neighborhood
There are some restaurants too, like modern market and hanks bbq that are putting together grocery packages for delivery. The modern market is particularly good as it has meat and veggies (or just veggies if you don‚Äôt eat meat).
Thanks much for the suggestion. Will keep in mind. Definitely eat meat.
This is a perfect example of being neighborly. It warms my old ticker. The current situation is tragic, but you guys jump to help, no questions asked. Needless to say, I am very impressed & thankful. It reminds me of how everyone helped each other during a big snowstorm when I was a kid...that was MANY moons ago. Keep it up you all, maybe we can start a trend that will last AFTER this tragic time is over. It would be so nice to wave to someone & actually be acknowledged. Ahhhh, ""Those were the days.""

289,440,440,152700192,Bety Ziman,Hilltop,24 Jun,"KingSoopers on Leetsdale. I was told by an employee that Glendale does not require enforcement of face coverings and that's why they allow people to walk around the store without them after I asked three  employees to tell costumers that didn't have a mask on to ask them to wear one.
Interesting",tell employee require enforcement face covering allow people walk store ask employee tell costumer mask ask wear interesting,"ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
You are correct. Glendale doesn‚Äôt require them. If King Soopers doesn‚Äôt require it and you object, why not just shop elsewhere?
Perhaps she has started shopping elsewhere after finding out.  I, for one, appreciate the information.
I didn't know that
Why wouldn‚Äôt you wear a mask? It‚Äôs for the health of everyone.
I am also glad to know - won't be going there.
Thanks, Glad to know that. Won't be shopping there.
Interesting is that you found three employees wearing masks correctly...
I work up in the Longmont Firestone area.  Nobody wearing masks up here.  Once people started rioting in the streets, I think most people gave up on the masks honestly.  I have been seeing huge back yard BBQ and pool parties.  Its not supposed to work unless we all wear them right?? I believe this battle has been lost.(edited)
I heard that protesting actually makes you immune /s
Thank you so much for sharing because I had no idea. I like to confirm information and educate myself, so I called King Soopers, Safeway, and Target corporate offices to find out what each of the policy are for each. All three of them do require their employees to wear masks due to state regulations. However, Colorado does not mandate the customers wear a mask. ‚ÄúDrawing on these orders, Amended Public Health Order 20-28 mandates that employees at businesses wear non-medical face coverings, and recommends that businesses encourage all clients, customers, or patients to do the same.‚Äù Updated 6/19/20 and copied from the ‚ÄòGuidance for Employers and Places of Public Accommodation‚Äô located on the Colorado government page: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14DNDIBBr8guROAjywtfpIxio24qbexF6xatv2t7bpRU/edit  
Trader Joe‚Äôs requires them, and since in the city of Denver it‚Äôs a mandate, I think more would follow. It‚Äôs interesting that they require their employees to wear them for the safety of the customers, but don‚Äôt require the same respect of customers for their employees.
Kelly Hanson Thank you, I often forget Traders because the location near me is on Colorado Blvd so it is somewhat of a pain to get in and out of. BUT, Natural Grocery stores also require it. Now I have a couple of options. :)
i think this would be better to take up with management and glendale, rather than just the employees as they can't really do much. I do agree tho, people should be wearing their masks
It‚Äôs not required
It‚Äôs the same at every store. I called the manager at Safeway off Krameria and 14th about the same thing. They can‚Äôt enforce it.
I think it‚Äôs time for everyone to stop wanting to force others to do what they think is right. If a city or county does not require masks in certain settings and others do, great! Enforcement should be LOCAL. 
Freedom to make other vulnerable people sick? That‚Äôs sick...
I shopped there earlier today, only grabbed a few things from the produce department but the entrance was very clearly marked with multiple ‚Äúfacial coverings required‚Äù signs and I only saw one or two people without. You aren‚Äôt going to be able to control everyone, especially with the some of the less desirable folks that hang out there (one guy without a mask was bragging about how he‚Äôs finally quit smoking after a month in jail...), and you‚Äôll probably drive yourself nuts if you try.
Considering I just watched a video of this elderly guy literally shoving and pushing a Walmart employee in Florida who was telling him he couldn't go in without a mask, I can hardly blame the employees. Retail is a terrible job. Try and tell a lady with a purse dog that she can't bring in the purse dog and she'll flip a lid on you; I can only imagine how much worse it is trying to enforce masks. I wish more cities would be the ones to say ""masks required inside"" like Denver does because that at least takes SOME burden off the employees.  Either way I'm grateful I don't work retail anymore.
Maybe shop elsewhere, just a thought
AMEN
King Soopers on Leetsdale is Arapahoe County, not Denver.  Denver is the only county that is requiring them at this point
John Mink only the northeast corner is Denver. The rest is Arapahoe
Parts of Glendale are in BOTH Arapahoe & Denver county. Google it. & WHY is this relevant???
I was at the King Soopers on University and Hampden today multiple people were not wearing masks.
Is that Denver or Arapahoe County?
Denver
Isn't it about time people stop complaining about everything? When I shop at Spers Leetsdale, I feel grateful for how nicely they keep up the store, how kind and helpful is almost every employee, and that I have access to so much fresh produce. Can't we spend more time thanking workers and management and being aware how things continue to work well more or less. The ""victim"" and blaming mentality has been overdone.

Gardner has a history of painting constituent calls as ‚Äúoutside interests‚Äù interfering with Colorado business. This was based on the mistaken assumption that out of state numbers are not constituents. I have a 503 area code and live in 80209. I inform him of this whenever I call. 
Good luck with that.
I called and left a message in the answering machine without a problem
I have called and gotten voicemail, but not recently. Emails generally go unanswered for about three to four weeks.

Send an email. Someone checks those
Every time I call Cory Gardner, I get voice mail, received only one scripted response to numerous emails.  I called Michael Bennet, spoke to an assistant who listened, took notes and thanked me for my call.  I hope this information helps.

Dear Kelli:
If this is what can be considered a political post then so to is every one about housing issues and zoning of 5 story buildings in a residential area. Can we start taking those down too?
Fact based discussion on reaching our pols is not politics.  They‚Äôre the politicians and work for us.  We are their constituents and in a democracy we have every right to expect them to reply to us.
Give it a rest. Not a political platform here. Grow up
Grow up???? What a shocking response---really??? Our republic is not about being a grown up?? You may not like to see this and that's fine but grow up?? How old are you??
Sandra, Trying to find an effective avenue to reach elected representatives is only political due to the category.  It is not expressing a view.  You trying to suppress the asking of the question is inappropriate, honestly.
I agree.  In particular, local issues such as schools and roads and garbage and policing always have a political dimension.  Often times, organizing to fix something even without politicians involved still requires coordinating with them.  All of us care about Denver, and about Colorado.  We can support each other in that caring regardless of party.   I haven't seen much ""politics"" in this thread other than people trying to help each other out to get in contact with their representative.
Everything is political now, Gardner does not care about Colorado, only Trump.
","Cory Gardner. I have tried to call Cory Gardner‚Äôs office in Denver and Washington DC a combined total of 16 times today to express my opinions on the impeachment process.   No one ever answered the phone at either location.    And no return call.   Important time for us all to be involved citizens and to express opinions, and to help our elected leaders represent us.  Just sorry that there does not appear to be an avenue to do that.   Have others had different experiences?   I‚Äôm getting peeved.  Talked to someone in Bennett‚Äôs office on first try.   Please note‚Äî-this is only a political post in that ‚ÄòWe,The People‚Äô should have access.  Please don‚Äôt turn this into something it is not.  But, please make your thoughts known to our reps, if you can....Only calls from the White House of Sen. McConnell
This is political..not the place please
Not political.  It‚Äôs a process question.
Big suprise here
Have you tried contacting Cardboard Cory? Tends to be more reliable.
Do you have Cory's number? I'll try calling too.
(202) 224-5941
I posted all Bennet‚Äôs & Gardner‚Äôs numbers elsewhere in this thread.
I have emailed him many, many times over the past 3 years and have gotten canned responses back several months later.
Same with DIANA DeGette, except I never even got the canned responses

It should be on the bike wheel. But it‚Äôs the circumference of the tire. Nobody
Oops I didn‚Äôt mean to write nobody
Walmart will still sell one
I just went and measured. I believe it is 24"". the bike was my son's, he grew out of it. It has been in 1 small crash, just needs a little adjustment. It's a pretty bike, black, leather seat, upright handlebars. Want to come take a look? I'm home usually. (That's my little joke...) PM me if so.
Bike shops are open
Campus Cycles is open on Evans near DU.  They had a couple of 24‚Äù girls bikes yesterday.
Cycleton in Stapleton is still open!  And I think Denver Bicycles on Colfax is too.
Also, there is a Specialized Hot Rock 24"" that was just posted on Lowry Kids Swap.   Looks to be a metallic light blue color.

293,444,444,146063663,Anne Bouise Ward,Hilltop,26 Apr 20,"Goodwill needs donations. Hi everyone. Goodwill is asking everyone to continue to donate. Here‚Äôs an email from the CEO.

Dear Friend of Goodwill,

Like many Coloradans, Goodwill has demonstrated its ability to adapt to a fast-changing landscape. The COVID-19 pandemic facing the country has had a profound impact on charitable organizations like Goodwill to provide services in an unprecedented manner. We cannot do this without you! Please donate today!

Goodwill is more than a retail store; it is a crucial resource that provides workforce development programs to our community, and our services are needed now more than ever as many of our neighbors face significant financial hardships. The closing of our retail locations has led to a perilous loss in revenue. Your support is needed now more than ever.

Goodwill continues to donate clothing to shelters for homeless individuals, and is laundering and donating medical scrubs. In addition, we are continuing many of our mission programs to help individuals achieve greater independence‚Äîespecially important during these uncertain times. Most recently, Goodwill has begun to collect PPE and canned goods at our store donation centers for Colorado's Office of Emergency Management. Your financial contribution will aid in our ability to continue to meet the needs of our community.

Please show your support and give now to help Goodwill extend our mission to more Coloradans. Your generosity will help individuals stay healthy and safe, and experience greater independence.

We deeply appreciate your support, thank you!

ÔªøSincerely,

It couldn‚Äôt have been easier. They have a drive thru set up and someone removes the items from your car. I think they are open M-Sat.
Thanks for that update I‚Äôve been purging like crazy but didn‚Äôt think they were open so I‚Äôve got stockpile of great stuff
Great to know , thanks for the info.
Donation hours are 10 am- 6 pm daily. Per website.
I just googled CEO of Goodwill - and found that the CEO Jim Gibbons made $729,000. in salary and deferred compensation in 2017.  That's a very big salary for a ""non-profit.""  A little offensive to me.
Where can I apply for that job lol
The Assistance League of Denver, which is 100% volunteer non profit, has a Thrift Shop at 6265 E Evans. The money raised supports programs for children and seniors. Hopefully the shop will open June 1.
We are taking them lots of things. They recognize our car now!
Will they take furniture and other items besides PPE and canned food?  How about ARC?
Goodwill is a fake charity. Support Arc or other local thrift stores instead
Not true, and Nextdoor is not the place to make accusations like that.(edited)
Thank you, I wasn‚Äôt sure if they were accepting donations!
Where can you drop off clothing etc. donations?
Drive thru at Leetsdale store. Upon arrival - stay in the car and pop the trunk. GW managed to keep employees working (out of the unemployment line) . . . If only my employer was that committed.
Goodwill on Leetsdale and Elm St is where I drop off. Its the most convenient for me and they remove it from your car trunk with masks and gloves on, to maintain social distancing.
I have started donating to Denver rescue mission thst works with many worth organizations, helping people set up their homes,,resetting refugees etc.  They art at 39th near holly and are AMAZING. ( donations are given away, not sold) and they also have programs to help people get back on their feet.   I donated lots of furniture to habitat but they sell the stuff...
Excellent idea.
Meredith- what kinds of things do they take?
Everything.  Nothing gets wasted.  My mom just passed and I donated medical ( walker, first aid, etc) soft goods ( clothing, linens, feather bed) household items ( drip leaf table, bookcases, coffee table, )  office supplies, electronics, food and sbacks ... they are sooooo cool and kind.  My go- to organization. Some things by appointment because this is theur warehouse and I think they have classes there.
Where can we make a drop off? The one on 6th and Clayton is closed.
We have a large bag that my husband dropped off at 6th and Clayton. He said there were other bags out there as well.  Had I read this before he did this, I would have advised against it.  I hope the people in need will receive it.
Please consider donating to ARC.
Where is an Arc drop off? They closed the one on leetsdale rd.  I‚Äôm happy
Thanks Anne.  Glad to know some of them are open because I noticed the 6th Ave one reason closed.  
Thanks so much for sharing! Didn‚Äôt know they were still taking donations. Will spread the word to friends cleaning their homes!

Please contact director of Asset Management at Colorado Housing Finance Authority Monday as there are many tax credit properties in the neighborhood.  I will also give them a call
I work for a company called Sonder. We have 90 apartments around the city that we operate like Airbnb‚Äôs- we are providing 40% off stays for 14+ nights. We are trying to help people in this exact situation. Feel free to take a look online or let me know if you have any questions!
We are looking at providing RVs and motor homes to medical providers in need of quarantine from their families. Pm me for more details and thank you for the amazing work you are doing for the rest of us.
Justin Case thank you. We used the same model with wildfire survivors in CA and delivered 80+ RV‚Äôs to families who lost their homes in the fires. We are all volunteers and would love to help our brave medical professionals who need an emergency housing solution during this crisis.
James Faircloth. 
Thank you James! I hope we don‚Äôt get into the situation. We are still in knee deep trying to sort out what we are going to do with PPE shortage. I will for sure reach out to you as soon as I know there is a need
Hi, Karina. Please reach out to me directly. We have a home a block away from PSL with extra rooms that we have on Airbnb. Obviously, they're not being used right now so we have some space.
Im a landlord!  Message me.  I have four rooms to donate.
We will contact our landlord. The unit below us (1 of 6 in our house) is vacant right now.
I emailed the top execs at CHFA.  Waiting to hear back
I have heard back from the Colorado Housing &Finance Authority.  They are checking their availability and will get back with me.  If there are units CPW can helpfully donations for some beds and household goods. More to come
Thank you for your help.
I created intake forms for housing donors and medical providers.  I‚Äôm happy to track and match both. This is the same model we used to help families who lost everything in the California wildfires and our org was named a CNN hero of the year in 2019 for our work. Happy to help organize this. 
Shout out to a stand up guy! Thank you James ""Woody"" Faircloth. What items do you need to stock the apts, RV's, houses? I have an extra toaster oven, coffee maker, lots of extras. Let me know
I'm RIGHT by both Presbyterian St Luke's and Jewish National. Colfax and High. I have been doing Airbnb and there's a vacant apartment here as well. Let me know.
Would you be so kind as to fill out this intake form so we can keep track? It will take you less than 5 minutes. 
James ‚ÄúWoody‚Äù Faircloth I did.
Hi Woody, I filled out the housing available form. It took less than 5 minutes. Thank you for all that you are doing!
Thank you!!! The only way this works is because of caring generous people like you! I‚Äôll be in touch!
I want to thank you all for the generous reply. I have communicated this to the ceo of my group and our hospital. I will be getting back to you all very soon!

Please contact director of Asset Management at Colorado Housing Finance Authority Monday as there are many tax credit properties in the neighborhood.  I will also give them a call
I work for a company called Sonder. We have 90 apartments around the city that we operate like Airbnb‚Äôs- we are providing 40% off stays for 14+ nights. We are trying to help people in this exact situation. Feel free to take a look online or let me know if you have any questions!
We are looking at providing RVs and motor homes to medical providers in need of quarantine from their families. Pm me for more details and thank you for the amazing work you are doing for the rest of us.
Justin Case thank you. We used the same model with wildfire survivors in CA and delivered 80+ RV‚Äôs to families who lost their homes in the fires. We are all volunteers and would love to help our brave medical professionals who need an emergency housing solution during this crisis.
James Faircloth. 
Thank you James! I hope we don‚Äôt get into the situation. We are still in knee deep trying to sort out what we are going to do with PPE shortage. I will for sure reach out to you as soon as I know there is a need
Hi, Karina. Please reach out to me directly. We have a home a block away from PSL with extra rooms that we have on Airbnb. Obviously, they're not being used right now so we have some space.
Im a landlord!  Message me.  I have four rooms to donate.
We will contact our landlord. The unit below us (1 of 6 in our house) is vacant right now.
I emailed the top execs at CHFA.  Waiting to hear back
I have heard back from the Colorado Housing &Finance Authority.  They are checking their availability and will get back with me.  If there are units CPW can helpfully donations for some beds and household goods. More to come
Thank you for your help.
I created intake forms for housing donors and medical providers.  I‚Äôm happy to track and match both. This is the same model we used to help families who lost everything in the California wildfires and our org was named a CNN hero of the year in 2019 for our work. Happy to help organize this. 
Shout out to a stand up guy! Thank you James ""Woody"" Faircloth. What items do you need to stock the apts, RV's, houses? I have an extra toaster oven, coffee maker, lots of extras. Let me know
I'm RIGHT by both Presbyterian St Luke's and Jewish National. Colfax and High. I have been doing Airbnb and there's a vacant apartment here as well. Let me know.
Would you be so kind as to fill out this intake form so we can keep track? It will take you less than 5 minutes. 
James ‚ÄúWoody‚Äù Faircloth I did.
Hi Woody, I filled out the housing available form. It took less than 5 minutes. Thank you for all that you are doing!
Thank you!!! The only way this works is because of caring generous people like you! I‚Äôll be in touch!
I want to thank you all for the generous reply. I have communicated this to the ceo of my group and our hospital. I will be getting back to you all very soon!
We have two single family homes and an RV lined up already thanks to some very generous neighbors. We also set up a simple web page to capture donors and recipients.

I was sadly surprised to see that my go-to shoe repair shop in east Cherry Creek has been replaced by a 10ish story building. 

I searched nextdoor for shoe repair with minimal results. 

Anyone have a great recommendation for shoe repair?",neighbor sadly surprised shoe repair shop replace story building search nextdoor shoe repair minimal result great recommendation shoe repair,"Dardanos on Colorado, roughly across the street from Safeway and Nordstrom Rack.
I agree- Dardanos is the place
I second Dardano‚Äôs
In Cherry Creek North. I have used them several times. http://www.modernshoesrepair.com/(edited)
I second modern shoe repair!  I have used them several time and they do great!!

I third Dardanos!

The shop by the bakery and Dollar Store on Holly and Leetsdale has very nice owners and did a good job for me.
I've had wonderful experiences with Phelps Shoe Services
Y &L  shoe repair on Holly in the strip of businesses to the south of Morning Story on Leetsdale on the west side of those businesses, next to the French bakery
I took a pair of boots to the Dry Cleaners that is behind the Starbucks at 8th and Colorado. They give it to their shoe repair guy and then when he brings it back they call you. The price was reasonable and they did a good job. :)
The   Cherry creek shoe repair is in the shopping center Leetsdale and Holly

Dardano‚Äôs!!!
Y and L Shoe repair 600 so Holly, west side of building. Very nice owner. I brought in a pair of men‚Äôs boots from a homeless man. They replaced and upgraded soles and heals and charged for materials only.
There is this little place by Bungalow in the same parking lot As Stein Mart and Joannes on S. Colorado Blvd. and Yale. He is very affordable and wonderful to work with. Dardanos  is a very weak shoe shop in my opinion try this guy you‚Äôll love him.
It‚Äôs called Phelps Shoe Repair and he‚Äôs much more affordable than Dardano‚Äôs.(edited)
Dardano's has a shoe repair place right in the back of the store
Dardano's!
The Custom House @ Expostion & Leetsdale. I took a pair of boots to Dardano‚Äôs that needed more extensive work and they sent me to The Custom House. Lovely small business that did excellent work (and they also do tailoring). I highly recommend them.
Same experience too....They are lovely at The Custom House. (& very nice of Dardano‚Äôs to recommend them).
I‚Äôve been using Phelps Shoe Repair in University Hills for years. Eddie, the owner, can do anything and is more than reasonable. They‚Äôre behind BatteriesPlus and across from Joanne‚Äôs.

just had a delivery from Amazon and they instantly notified me and emailed photo of package on my doorstep .. went out and all good ..
I can usually do the same as I‚Äôm usually home. I had run by the house in between errands bc I got a notification 30 minutes before this of another package. But I was further than 12 minutes away when I got the next notification of another delivery.
Points for the movie reference.  I've chased people away while walking my dog in the neighborhood.   They get defensive, as if I'm taking something away from them, or it's their right to steal.  I'm actually afraid of violence with these people.  They are amateur and brazen, and will do stupid things. Be careful.
Yes, you do the same. The sense of entitlement is ludicrous. Thanks for getting my humor!
Amazon now has delivery lockers. There is one at the 7/11 on 8th and Colorado. Consider shipping your purchases there to put these Porch Pirates out of business. They just follow the Amazon van around. Easy pickings.
Yep, I was just telling my mom this will be my new delivery address for Amazon. It‚Äôs just sad and annoying that I have to be inconvenienced bc of some strangers sense of entitlement.

His sweatshirt might say ""Hawkeyes"" on it -- as in Iowa.
It was probably stolen the day before. If anyone gets footage of him in a green ‚ÄúPaddy‚Äôs Pub‚Äù tshirt you know where it came from
If you have a dog or a cat you can start filling used amazon boxes with a nice surprise and leave them out there. May not stop the problem but at least a little revenge.
CREEPS....
I got a mailbox by the King Sooper. They are awesome. They give signatures etc. and you definitely get your orders. It‚Äôs a bummer this is where we are as a culture, but we are!!
I had one stolen by a fat woman yesterday.
Does anyone get caught and packages returned using this Ring?
The police will not go after them most of the time...
Did you know you can have things delivered to a lockbox 
And whole foods, but who wants to fight the traffic in that parking lot!
Yeah, this won‚Äôt happen again. Fool me once...
My daughter has a shovel on her front porch and lately amazon guy has been placing (smallish) packages behind it- at least it‚Äôs a little more discreet. Otherwise the lockers are a great way to go.
Cherry Creek North neighbors-- I work from home and have it set up for the delivery guys to put stuff over the locked gate at the front of my home, landing on a table. You are welcome to redirect your stuff here, I will keep it safe, as a courtesy to my neighbors. PM me.
Unbelievable, lately these thieves look right to the camera and don't even care. I think best is neighbors helping each other like offered by one of our CC neighbors. Maybe if we reduce or completely eliminate packages at the doors, thieves will give up and go somewhere else.
Agreed. That‚Äôs why they get away with it and look directly into the camera whilst ringing the bell, bc there‚Äôs no consequence. To be honest, I‚Äôve only had one Denver officer ever help me with issues around my property. When I had a homeless man defalcating in my YARD in front of my child I went to the station to report it. They literally told me that I needed to take a photo of him in the act next time for evidence! Umm, the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù was still sitting in my yard! And what‚Äôs worse is the SAME guy has stood at the corner every day since for YEARS and at the end of the day, he gets into his car parked at Anthony‚Äôs and goes home! (Not homeless!) I know this bc he told an officer that he commutes from Aurora bc it‚Äôs lucrative in our neighborhood (and I‚Äôve seen him get into the car!)
Katie Mattson The police really should try to go after these people if they‚Äôre pawning this stuff to pay for a meth lab or other illicit crap. Imagine a little detective work helping citizens?
I feel like they are so restricted with what they can do now (30 day eviction notice if someone moves in under a tree on the parkway), that the vagrants just run free.(edited)
Amazon refunded my package that was stolen last week.  (Amazon rocks!)
Oh really?? Thank you, I will try that! This is my first experience so I didn‚Äôt know they‚Äôd do that!

For those of you who were offended and called me rude and ignorant were not exactly on the right side to express their feelings to me in such a way were very rude too. So I have learned that some of my neighbors don‚Äôt receive my comments in as such in conversation and take things very personal.. if I wanted to do something I would not care what others say because I would feel good doing it
I think it‚Äôs awesome that you want to donate items! I‚Äôm sorry that people have been so ignorant and rude to you!

I definitely understand the tampering issue. I wondered about that myself. I just can‚Äôt believe someone trying to do a nice thing would be spoken to the way Ingrid was.

I did respond but it was in response to Jane, whose comments were removed. I appreciate the suggestions.
I often pick up the small bottles from my motel room when I travel.  I've dropped off small bottles of shampoo, conditioner (great for shaving legs!), lotion, and small soaps at The Gathering Place. I've done the same with extra travel size toothpaste and floss from my dentist.   They seem very appreciative.
Now that‚Äôs very thoughtful, and they aren‚Äôt used, when in Israel my girlfriend would take the shampoo and shower gel to give to homeless at home US.
Since you had several digested places to donate , which place did you donate to? Who was willing to take ur used toiletries?
Why is it everyone brushes everything under the rug and all I ask was where w the items donated, and I‚Äôm aggressive, some of these remarks are pathetic and beyond my understanding of why people are so submissive to anything. I ask a simple question, I even made a suggestion for donation, just wanted to know where she took them, since she was so sincere about giving them away, such a big deal the whole thing. You should be curious about the outcome as well, where were they taken or where they even accepted?
I have found out what petty neighbors I have website not what is intended or meant to be I‚Äôm sure, why can‚Äôt people just be positive when making a remark with the bullying and pointed finger, all so childish. I was told these very things yet they r being used by others. So hypocritical.

This is truly an unprecedented time. I was wrong. Like many people in healthcare, I scoffed at those taking this now pandemic so seriously when it seemed like the flu is serious every year and we can't even get people to get their flu shot or wash their hands. We were given tables of data showing how the flu has a higher mortality rate and initially looked at this like it was just another thing. But now it is very clear that this is not going away. And it has the potential to completely overwhelm our healthcare system. I don't say any of this to encourage or condone panic. Panic and hoarding is the last thing that anyone should do. Let's all come together and help the most vulnerable among us.

Starting tomorrow 3/16 we will deliver any prescriptions for free. We will work with your insurance company to get longer day supplies if needed. We will be posting on social media whenever we get vital supplies in like hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies. And we would like to coordinate volunteers for grocery shopping for folks that need it. We will regularly wipe down all surfaces at the pharmacy and do our best to keep it as safe as possible. What else can we do for you Congress Park??? Tell us the need and let's all solve it together.

I'm already aware of one need. For doctors, pharmacists, nurses, etc....anyone on the front lines....we need help with our kids. And we can't have a ton of kids at one place because that defeats the purpose of social distancing to flatten the curve. So if you have a neighbor that's a first responder that has to go to work, and you yourself are not a vulnerable population, offer to help that family. This is a vital contribution you could be making if you are not able to work and are healthy. How else can we all think to help?? I'm so interested to hear your responses. And please, feel free to call and ask for help. I have so many wonderful patients that want to help others. We can connect people with the resources they need.

I was feeling like a broken record saying ""this isn't the flu.""  This is a virus - wash your hands, sing Happy Birthday - under the rings scrub - social distancing - get your sleep - it will pass.  The Spanish Flu died out - this will too.  But the best way you can help the medical people is social distancing so you don't get sick & we don't have to take care of you.  It works.  It sucks to cancel vacations as I did - I was to be on a beach today.  Now I will probably work on my vacation.

If your building has a dumpster, you don't likely have city trash and may need to pick a neighbor's address on large item pick up day. Leaving it by a dumpster will likely incur additional fees from your trash pickup company, if they're equipped to pick it up same-day at all. Here's Denver's large item pickup schedule: https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/trash-and-recycling/trash-collection/ETC.html(edited)
If you are able to, you can also take it to AFW and they will dispose of it for a $15.00 fee.
You can schedule a pick up with Spring Back Colorado Mattress recycling. I think it's $20 per mattress. They will come to you to pick up the mattress. They actually break down the mattress into parts and repurpose them. https://www.springbackco.org/ Definitely the more environmentally friendly way to go. I have seen Denver's large pick up days and they literally throw the furniture into a trash truck and grind it up. The items end up in pieces in the landfill. Great way to get rid of them, but not very environmentally friendly.

Exactly so they shouldn‚Äôt be able to impose anything like this within an area where people do
If you don‚Äôt like it, go start a federal/state campaign to strip all churches of their tax-exempt status. But be sure to tell everyone why you‚Äôre fired up about it.

What a mess for EVERYONE concerned.... Residents & homeless.
People want to help as long as it‚Äôs not in their backyard
Ossie R. Reading through this thread I'm not sure I'd even agree that people want to help. Some are so disgusted by these human beings that they don't seem to care what happens to them as long as they don't have to deal with it in their neighborhood.
I understand the point of those advocating for compassion...but this isn‚Äôt the right manifestation of it. The people who live in the neighborhood and send their kids to school there should also have there rights a safe environment respected. I agree with many that argue it‚Äôs easy to condemn from a distance.
Read it again John
John S. The neighborhood, and the surrounding neighborhods, already have homeless people living in them. This will be an improvement over people living in alleys. This is a controlled living situation. Please explain the danger to the neighbors
I don't understand where these homeless people were living before now.  There has been a moratorium pretty much nationwide against evictions and foreclosures.  Which implies that nobody has been recently displaced in the last year.    
The key word here is implies.  But it‚Äôs not the truth, plenty of people have been kicked out of their apartments in the last year. They can‚Äôt afford legal fees to fight for their apartment.

Here is some great info and a great video on these villages!!
I wish the US had more mental health help. I mean where are all these people supposed to go that need help? Also why doesn‚Äôt the city find a place to build miniature houses to get some of them back on their feet or the counseling they need?
It's actually cheaper to do what you are recamending instead of keeping them homeless you can look it up !
Fast fact to leave the average homeless person on the street cost roughly $40,000 per person. To house them and provide mental and physical support costs roughy $15,000 a year. I learned this at a rally at the Capitol a few years ago.( The dollar amount may be a little off but very close to what I stated)  It's actually saves tax payers money to house the homeless and give them skills and the ability to be clean and get hired than it does to leave them on the streets.a very good friend of mine runs one of these sights. many of the homeless that take advantage of these camps are our vets and our disabled homeless and our mentality ill. The ones that need it!  The people that cause the crimes are the druggies not the bulk of the homeless population. And the drug users usually don't even have it together enough to get into places like this. These people are actually to improve their lives. If people would actually take some time to get to know the people in the camps before insisting these people are going to hurt there kids( which is a bit of an over reach ) they would come to see the difference. There are alot of criminals on the streets but they are different that alot of the homeless population. I'm not saying criminals cannot be homeless because of course they can be however the people at these camps just want some help and supervision at least at the camp my friend supervises that's what I have seen first hand. Majority or the population is older or mentality ill or disabled and trying to get some help . The criminals are running the streets while these people sleep quietly in there tents !
Anna - while I agree that those that want help should be able to get it, there are many options already that exist in Denver. See https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Departments/Department-of-Housing-Stability/Resident-Resources.  Where I live, we have a different problem.  Most of the people in the street tents are mostly young men (and some women) who are hard core drug addicts who do heroin and meth all day.  I have never seen a single child in any of these tents in our neighborhood, and I see them in the alley right outside my bedroom window every day.  I also met with the Denver Police this week, and the police confirmed they are ""service resistant"" people meaning that they are offered mental health, drug treatment, and housing support every day and they refuse.  They instead want the ""freedom"" to live in a tent, do drugs, and not have to change.  People (many from churches) bring them food to eat every day.  I saw a van full of nuns do this last week.  The drug tents remain in neighborhoods who are terrorized by these people every day with open drug use, public deification, completely blocked sidewalks, urination, stolen bicycles, car theft, prostitution, yelling in the middle of the night, etc..  I have been the victim of this crime with 7 of these illegal drug tent ""communities"" within 1 block of me for over the last year.  Trust me, you do not want to have to live with this!  Last year someone was stabbed right on my block next to a child care center in daylight hours.  This is real and not made up.  While the Denver Health Department does ""clean up"" or sweep these illegal drug tents, it can take months for them to do so.  However, the people just move down the street and set up their tents again, and stay in the new location for months, causing havoc at the new location.  While there is an urban camping ban, the police and Denver Heath Department have many restrictions now (at least 1 week notice, search warrant to even open a tent, public heath impact assessments, etc.)  The police told us that there is an 8 page ""protocol"" document they must follow to deal with with an encampment.  Most of this is due to a lawsuit that the ""pro-tent"" people won in court.  Also, Denver has made heroin and meth use a misdemeanor, so the police don't even bother arresting people for this anymore.  The word is out in the ""drug culture"" community that Denver is a great place to settle  in a tent.  People feed you all day, you get cheap and easy assess to your drugs, and the police will do nothing to stop you!  You might have to move your tent every few months, but the weather is great, except in the winter!  The only way to stop a drug tent community is to put up fencing (or big rocks, or other defensive architecture) to make it impossible for these folks to pitch a tent on your street or on your property.(edited)
That's exactly what I was saying, help those who will benefit most and provide mental health to others, etc. But how?
Maybe ask the indigenous Americans how well reservations have worked for them.   Funding substance abuse  and mental health treatment would help the majority of urban houseless far more than sending them to sanctioned reservations where substance abuse festers and the schizophrenic languish.
This is a terrible comparison and a wild mischaracterization of why these issues manifest on reservations.
Can‚Äôt we require developers to make a small %age of new construction (5%\10%) affordable? There is so much construction in Colorado. It means slightly less profit, but let‚Äôs spread the cost.

I just made a donation to CVC in support of their efforts to back compassion with action. I hope you‚Äôll join me! https://www.coloradovillagecollaborative.org/donate-sos?fbclid=IwAR028026xhSuR9n-WE_q7VbnlkxOroLezHUPPai-GtI7wTMBm3XTY716hfw?dref=per_3594bdf8a82a
Here is some great info and a great video on these villages!!
I wish the US had more mental health help. I mean where are all these people supposed to go that need help? Also why doesn‚Äôt the city find a place to build miniature houses to get some of them back on their feet or the counseling they need?
It's actually cheaper to do what you are recamending instead of keeping them homeless you can look it up !
Fast fact to leave the average homeless person on the street cost roughly $40,000 per person. To house them and provide mental and physical support costs roughy $15,000 a year. I learned this at a rally at the Capitol a few years ago.( The dollar amount may be a little off but very close to what I stated)  It's actually saves tax payers money to house the homeless and give them skills and the ability to be clean and get hired than it does to leave them on the streets.a very good friend of mine runs one of these sights. many of the homeless that take advantage of these camps are our vets and our disabled homeless and our mentality ill. The ones that need it!  The people that cause the crimes are the druggies not the bulk of the homeless population. And the drug users usually don't even have it together enough to get into places like this. These people are actually to improve their lives. If people would actually take some time to get to know the people in the camps before insisting these people are going to hurt there kids( which is a bit of an over reach ) they would come to see the difference. There are alot of criminals on the streets but they are different that alot of the homeless population. I'm not saying criminals cannot be homeless because of course they can be however the people at these camps just want some help and supervision at least at the camp my friend supervises that's what I have seen first hand. Majority or the population is older or mentality ill or disabled and trying to get some help . The criminals are running the streets while these people sleep quietly in there tents !
Anna - while I agree that those that want help should be able to get it, there are many options already that exist in Denver. See https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Departments/Department-of-Housing-Stability/Resident-Resources.  Where I live, we have a different problem.  Most of the people in the street tents are mostly young men (and some women) who are hard core drug addicts who do heroin and meth all day.  I have never seen a single child in any of these tents in our neighborhood, and I see them in the alley right outside my bedroom window every day.  I also met with the Denver Police this week, and the police confirmed they are ""service resistant"" people meaning that they are offered mental health, drug treatment, and housing support every day and they refuse.  They instead want the ""freedom"" to live in a tent, do drugs, and not have to change.  People (many from churches) bring them food to eat every day.  I saw a van full of nuns do this last week.  The drug tents remain in neighborhoods who are terrorized by these people every day with open drug use, public deification, completely blocked sidewalks, urination, stolen bicycles, car theft, prostitution, yelling in the middle of the night, etc..  I have been the victim of this crime with 7 of these illegal drug tent ""communities"" within 1 block of me for over the last year.  Trust me, you do not want to have to live with this!  Last year someone was stabbed right on my block next to a child care center in daylight hours.  This is real and not made up.  While the Denver Health Department does ""clean up"" or sweep these illegal drug tents, it can take months for them to do so.  However, the people just move down the street and set up their tents again, and stay in the new location for months, causing havoc at the new location.  While there is an urban camping ban, the police and Denver Heath Department have many restrictions now (at least 1 week notice, search warrant to even open a tent, public heath impact assessments, etc.)  The police told us that there is an 8 page ""protocol"" document they must follow to deal with with an encampment.  Most of this is due to a lawsuit that the ""pro-tent"" people won in court.  Also, Denver has made heroin and meth use a misdemeanor, so the police don't even bother arresting people for this anymore.  The word is out in the ""drug culture"" community that Denver is a great place to settle  in a tent.  People feed you all day, you get cheap and easy assess to your drugs, and the police will do nothing to stop you!  You might have to move your tent every few months, but the weather is great, except in the winter!  The only way to stop a drug tent community is to put up fencing (or big rocks, or other defensive architecture) to make it impossible for these folks to pitch a tent on your street or on your property.(edited)
That's exactly what I was saying, help those who will benefit most and provide mental health to others, etc. But how?
Maybe ask the indigenous Americans how well reservations have worked for them.   Funding substance abuse  and mental health treatment would help the majority of urban houseless far more than sending them to sanctioned reservations where substance abuse festers and the schizophrenic languish.
This is a terrible comparison and a wild mischaracterization of why these issues manifest on reservations.
Can‚Äôt we require developers to make a small %age of new construction (5%\10%) affordable? There is so much construction in Colorado. It means slightly less profit, but let‚Äôs spread the cost.
They already do this, read about Stapleton

Agreed Angela.  Of course anyone complaining about this facility on Regis campus would NEVER be homeless themselves.  They could never imagine a circumstance that could cause them to need help.  Don't be so sure folks.
That is awesome!
I wholeheartedly support this!
I am not for or against. However I do find it odd that the mayor and governor on all things passed somehow eliminate their neighborhoods.  It is a sad situation.

I predict a sharp rise in crime, a drop in small business ownership, a general mood of a dark cloud to settle in, a massive increase in drug trafficking as well as paraphernalia litter everywhere, except property value to make a significant drop, general violence to rise, squatters to start taking root and eventually this will be how you sell your homes for a fraction of what you bought it for. Regis will bring as many miscreants as possible to our back yards but I'll bet my right eye nothing beyond an attraction for drugs and crime is provided in this safe space.

306,457,2,183301151,Sara Lange,South Park Hill,12 Apr,"Homeless Encampment Near You! If you thought the crime was getting bad around here lately Park Hill, just wait until a sanctioned homeless encampment arrives in a parking lot near YOU! Did you hear about the one that just blew up because of a homemade drug lab inside?! See the story for ways to possibly voice your concern...unless you're afraid to show your face on camera, that is! I'm personally VERY concerned about how this story seems to be flying under the radar.

Mike Tourneau I'm pretty horrified all this happened seemingly without the consult of the people in the neighborhood that are directly affected.
I'm not surprised its flying under the radar at all. Its just another facet of how society is changing, the PC culture of it all.
https://www.westword.com/news/denver-homeless-safe-camping-site-concept-park-hill-hancock-11936647
Melanie Weiss-Turner I wonder how many people in that encampment have an actionable plan to help themselves now that they have clean shelter paid for by taxpayers. While the article poses good news in the few months since it opened, it'll be interesting to see if these camps have a lasting effect on the people who were helped by it. I certainly hope so. That being said, it still sucks that this new camp in question was set up without communication to park hill neighbors beforehand. Its an awful way to go about it.
This hasn't flown under the radar. The site was selected and there are community meetings you may participate in: Saturday, May 1 from 10a.m.-11:30a.m. ‚Äî Tour a Safe Outdoor Space @ 1595 N. Pearl St.
The church itself is offering a Community Conversation around it: https://www.facebook.com/events/276809797283328/ 
For the record, I don't like the idea of human beings living in tents in a church parking lot as their housing-ever! Its intention is a temporary, safe, outdoor shelter. The problem of unaffordable housing and  n Denver is real folks! It is the leading cause of homelessness in Denver!  We as Park Hill residents are fortunate and fear shouldn't be the basis of our judgements. It is not intended to be a free-for-all ""encampment.""  People have to apply for a space and Safe Outdoor Spaces are staffed and managed 24/7 with bathrooms, showers, trash and laundry services, and COVID-19 testing. There will be 45 separate shelters serving 50 people.
Does anyone know what the criteria are for being 1 of the 50 selected?
NIMBY. Remember, the homeless problem is a citywide issue.  Get the facts on how these small encampments are managed before fear takes over.
Tim Townsend how about you take the time to explain the difference of an SOS instead of being lazy and, idk are you trying to be cool?, throwing around a buzz acronym. Calling people NIMBY will not sway anyone to the benefits of an SOS
Where can I find the story about the drug lab inside a SOS?
Vanessa Geiger https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/04/13/explosion-denver-homeless-camp-drug-lab/
People without homes often are in  the situation temporarily. Many people are only a missed payment away from having deal with the stresses of living on the street.
It's like no one learned anything from this past year. But then, so few acknowledge the lessons from the last recession either. I'm sure there are plenty of people in this very conversation with little to no idea just how precarious their own situation is. Let's just hope, given the pandemic and general state of the nation, we‚Äìall of us‚Äìavoid finding out. Otherwise, we should be careful the precedents we set now in terms of how the unfortunate among us are treated.
Quit fear mongering. The sanctioned camps are NOT ramshackle tent cities. They have not had any problems at the existing sanctioned camps in Cap Hill.
You can't just tell me to ""quit.""  I have a legitimate concern, and it seems many of my neighbors do too.  Everyone I speak to in person seems genuinely shocked about this news.  I look forward to watching you advocate for one in the Cole neighborhood!  In the meantime, I pay Park Hill property taxes, I'm allowed to voice my fears and pass them on to others.
Hey, I know we all have different opinions on what leads to homelessness due to our own unique backgrounds, but I think it's best not to vilify an entire population of people. I understand they make you uncomfortable, but the reality is, our unhoused neighbors deserve compassion and respect just like our housed neighbors do. If you can't get on board with the camp, fine. At least let them have some peace, and don't make their lives even harder than they currently are. Just direct your focus elsewhere and let them be. And if you really don't want them there, you might like to consider how you could help them rather than fear mongering about their presence. Helping them feel empowered and safe is the best way to lessen the impact of our unhoused friends on neighborhoods. Everyone deserves safety, security, and respect, regardless of their housing status, their ability levels, whether or not they suffer from addiction, etc. There's really no room to argue on this.
Thank you! I mean...look I get for the people of South Park Hill this really IS in their backyard. And they would've preferred a voice in the process (which I kind of read as the right to say no to it, which the church didn't ask for, the church just decided to do it. That's the church's own legal right as far as I can tell). But umm...it's happening. It's happening for 6 months, at a time when the people who will be in the Safe Outdoor Space really need it. It'd be nice to see the neighborhood come to grips with that and make the best of it instead of having a freakout over it. Just my two cents. Hope to see some of you all there volunteering at the site at some point.
How about we both admit each side has a point? No one, no matter how sympathetic and well-intentioned, wants human beings living in tents on their front lawns, and that sentiment is magnified when the encampments come with drugs, trash, human waste, etc. The Safe Outdoor Spaces are trying to address an entrenched problem by providing spaces that can be maintained and providing services to the people living there. They will probably be very helpful to higher functioning people who have lost their housing due to financial problems, but they will likely not address the many people who are on the street due to mental health and drug problems (which often go together). Take a deep breath, all. This is a citywide problem, and  Cap Hill, RiNo and Curtis Park shouldn't have to bear it alone.
Does this so-called sanctioned encampment comply with Denver's zoning ordinance?  Do we know how many of the 50 people have previously owned or rented homes in Denver?  Will be there only temporarily as a result of temporary economic circumstances?  Suffer from some form of primary addiction?  Some form of chronic mental health condition? Some form of chronic physical health condition?  Have criminal records?  Have recently moved to Denver?  Were experiencing homelessness when they moved here?  Lots to know and understand.
Do you really think you know about even your neighbors on any of those issues. Living in tents or houses doesn't change the fact you never know. Especially  people with money ,who can afford lawyers to get them off.
Anyone can be homeless, paying off doctors, education, lawyers, etc.  I am highly educated and yes, I have been homeless and not by my doing.  I also worked for the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless for little pay.  I know my clients did not deserve what happened to nearly all of them.  Drugs was an escape for the hopeless; many were very good, kind and caring people.  So, to remedy the trash, put more trash barrels out or recycle bins.  Let the camps be vested in the environment they live.  Right on to the Churches and donations that have gone above and beyond their abilities. Not all homeless are bad but like police, it only takes one or two bad guys to ruin a reputation.  Where can you send homeless people, anyway?  Any place can be bad or good.  Thanks to South Park Hill for getting out of the comfort zone and stepping up to help humanity.  Now, helping young teens becoming independent may reduce future houseless people, but there are no jobs when young ones are competing for the jobs older people need, and VOCATIONS are minimal or non-existent.  Simultaneously, we must work on current homeless and prevent further - and our country does a great job of segregating the poor from the wealthy.  I Love Park Hill because poor, hard working people and the wealthy people care, not just the old growth and old brick homes, but the diversity of my community.  I have lived here my whole life.  ...And, the new transplants join our thinking.  Thanks to you, too.  Thanks, Kozlowicz, NO fear-mongering.
RoSean Howard People are not fear-mongering as much as they are legitimately scared of the element of change a SOS can bring to their doorstep. The way to remedy, or at least lessen and sway people, is to inform not point fingers and all caps NIMBY at them. The website Tim Townsend posted is helpful and may sway some who are on the fence. Park Hill UM did the SOS a tremendous disservice by not getting ahead of the information. Try to remember, all of a sudden word got out a ""homeless encampment"" is being located in the middle of Park Hill. Neighbors are envisioning the encampments in and around Cap Hill that had rat infestation, super spreader events, criminal activity, etc. Being kind to everyone also encompasses those who are scared of how this will impact their neighborhood and lives, not just the homeless.
There but for the grace of God go I. Any one of us could be homeless in a city with astronomical housing prices and few safety nets. How many people lost jobs in the pandemic? How many lost housing due to banks and landlords‚Äô inflexibility once the pandemic hit? It could have been me. It could have been you. We have a responsibility to help our neighbors. My goodness we are so fortunate. I think every day how lucky I am to be fed, clothed, housed, with relative financial security. Don‚Äôt you? Don‚Äôt you ever look around your space and go, ‚Äúholy moly, am I lucky!‚Äù So many of our neighbors don‚Äôt have that. It‚Äôs not our place to judge each one asking why and how they are now unhoused. Instead, let‚Äôs help! Let‚Äôs volunteer at that church if they need it. Let‚Äôs offer odd jobs to those who want them. Let‚Äôs give of our abundance, share so more can have a little. Let us meet our unhoused neighbors with love and compassion, not fear and contempt. We are, all of us, human, and have erred in different ways. Some big some small. Some with the good fortune to bounce back, and some not. But we all deserve grace, and patience, and agency, and help. Don‚Äôt give in to fear. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of thinking you are so different from your unhoused neighbors. There but by the grace of God go we all.
You can volunteer at the existing SOS site to learn more here:
you cannot, as there isn't a story.  
Sara Lange In what way are they treated differently? If someone commits a crime, is arrested and sentenced, at what point does homelessness play a role?
If any of you are so appalled by this you want to sell your house, let me know. Looking to scoop up a single fam on the cheap :)
Same üòÖ
Ooh! Ditto! Something with 3 beds, 2 baths would be great! Happy to take the OP's place off her hands.
It's wonderful to see a church helping to provide shelter and services to the homeless in a city where housing prices are astronomically high. It seems to me like they are living their Christian values.
It seems to me they should shift their focus to reopening their church and school to in-person visits.  That is what people in the neighborhood understood they were moving near.  They understood the traffic, the schedules, the clientele that might frequent those places.  If UMC doesn't feel it's safe enough to open for school or worship, how can they safely take on the task of providing responsible housing?!
How about putting the camps in the Governors and Mayors backyards?????????
It will be a block from Senator Hickenlooper's house.
The backyard argument doesn't include the support services also necessary to pull someone out of homelessness. Perhaps talking with someone in that situation, understanding the trauma of living in a very unstable situation, and all that it takes to recover from it would help understanding. It's truly not a black-and-white situation. Some folks just don't ask for help until it's too late.
Please volunteer at the existing site before you make any judgements. They could use more volunteers. 
That waiver is pretty intenseüò≥ Why aren‚Äôt residents responsible for most of the tasks? It would be a start in learning responsibility I would think.
I didn‚Äôt know we paid taxes to have homeless camps move in next door??? Be that as it May! What is the Governor and Mayor doing about this situation! Some of these people want to stay in tents and the ones that need help to transition out of the camps into housing should be taken care of so they can move on! The Governor and Mayor are ignoring this and just moving people are the city like Chess pieces !‚ôü‚ôü‚ôü(edited)

","Homeless Encampment Near You! If you thought the crime was getting bad around here lately Park Hill, just wait until a sanctioned homeless encampment arrives in a parking lot near YOU! Did you hear about the one that just blew up because of a homemade drug lab inside?! See the story for ways to possibly voice your concern...unless you're afraid to show your face on camera, that is! I'm personally VERY concerned about how this story seems to be flying under the radar.

https://kdvr.com/news/local/sanctioned-homeless-encampment-coming-to-affluent-south-park-hill/Can‚Äôt wait for people to start justifying this.
Mike Tourneau I'm pretty horrified all this happened seemingly without the consult of the people in the neighborhood that are directly affected.
I'm not surprised its flying under the radar at all. Its just another facet of how society is changing, the PC culture of it all.
https://www.westword.com/news/denver-homeless-safe-camping-site-concept-park-hill-hancock-11936647
Melanie Weiss-Turner I wonder how many people in that encampment have an actionable plan to help themselves now that they have clean shelter paid for by taxpayers. While the article poses good news in the few months since it opened, it'll be interesting to see if these camps have a lasting effect on the people who were helped by it. I certainly hope so. That being said, it still sucks that this new camp in question was set up without communication to park hill neighbors beforehand. Its an awful way to go about it.
This hasn't flown under the radar. The site was selected and there are community meetings you may participate in: Saturday, May 1 from 10a.m.-11:30a.m. ‚Äî Tour a Safe Outdoor Space @ 1595 N. Pearl St.
The church itself is offering a Community Conversation around it: https://www.facebook.com/events/276809797283328/ 
For the record, I don't like the idea of human beings living in tents in a church parking lot as their housing-ever! Its intention is a temporary, safe, outdoor shelter. The problem of unaffordable housing and  n Denver is real folks! It is the leading cause of homelessness in Denver!  We as Park Hill residents are fortunate and fear shouldn't be the basis of our judgements. It is not intended to be a free-for-all ""encampment.""  People have to apply for a space and Safe Outdoor Spaces are staffed and managed 24/7 with bathrooms, showers, trash and laundry services, and COVID-19 testing. There will be 45 separate shelters serving 50 people.
Does anyone know what the criteria are for being 1 of the 50 selected?
NIMBY. Remember, the homeless problem is a citywide issue.  Get the facts on how these small encampments are managed before fear takes over.
Tim Townsend how about you take the time to explain the difference of an SOS instead of being lazy and, idk are you trying to be cool?, throwing around a buzz acronym. Calling people NIMBY will not sway anyone to the benefits of an SOS
Where can I find the story about the drug lab inside a SOS?
Vanessa Geiger https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/04/13/explosion-denver-homeless-camp-drug-lab/
People without homes often are in  the situation temporarily. Many people are only a missed payment away from having deal with the stresses of living on the street.
It's like no one learned anything from this past year. But then, so few acknowledge the lessons from the last recession either. I'm sure there are plenty of people in this very conversation with little to no idea just how precarious their own situation is. Let's just hope, given the pandemic and general state of the nation, we‚Äìall of us‚Äìavoid finding out. Otherwise, we should be careful the precedents we set now in terms of how the unfortunate among us are treated.
Quit fear mongering. The sanctioned camps are NOT ramshackle tent cities. They have not had any problems at the existing sanctioned camps in Cap Hill.
You can't just tell me to ""quit.""  I have a legitimate concern, and it seems many of my neighbors do too.  Everyone I speak to in person seems genuinely shocked about this news.  I look forward to watching you advocate for one in the Cole neighborhood!  In the meantime, I pay Park Hill property taxes, I'm allowed to voice my fears and pass them on to others.
Hey, I know we all have different opinions on what leads to homelessness due to our own unique backgrounds, but I think it's best not to vilify an entire population of people. I understand they make you uncomfortable, but the reality is, our unhoused neighbors deserve compassion and respect just like our housed neighbors do. If you can't get on board with the camp, fine. At least let them have some peace, and don't make their lives even harder than they currently are. Just direct your focus elsewhere and let them be. And if you really don't want them there, you might like to consider how you could help them rather than fear mongering about their presence. Helping them feel empowered and safe is the best way to lessen the impact of our unhoused friends on neighborhoods. Everyone deserves safety, security, and respect, regardless of their housing status, their ability levels, whether or not they suffer from addiction, etc. There's really no room to argue on this.
Thank you! I mean...look I get for the people of South Park Hill this really IS in their backyard. And they would've preferred a voice in the process (which I kind of read as the right to say no to it, which the church didn't ask for, the church just decided to do it. That's the church's own legal right as far as I can tell). But umm...it's happening. It's happening for 6 months, at a time when the people who will be in the Safe Outdoor Space really need it. It'd be nice to see the neighborhood come to grips with that and make the best of it instead of having a freakout over it. Just my two cents. Hope to see some of you all there volunteering at the site at some point.
How about we both admit each side has a point? No one, no matter how sympathetic and well-intentioned, wants human beings living in tents on their front lawns, and that sentiment is magnified when the encampments come with drugs, trash, human waste, etc. The Safe Outdoor Spaces are trying to address an entrenched problem by providing spaces that can be maintained and providing services to the people living there. They will probably be very helpful to higher functioning people who have lost their housing due to financial problems, but they will likely not address the many people who are on the street due to mental health and drug problems (which often go together). Take a deep breath, all. This is a citywide problem, and  Cap Hill, RiNo and Curtis Park shouldn't have to bear it alone.
Does this so-called sanctioned encampment comply with Denver's zoning ordinance?  Do we know how many of the 50 people have previously owned or rented homes in Denver?  Will be there only temporarily as a result of temporary economic circumstances?  Suffer from some form of primary addiction?  Some form of chronic mental health condition? Some form of chronic physical health condition?  Have criminal records?  Have recently moved to Denver?  Were experiencing homelessness when they moved here?  Lots to know and understand.
Do you really think you know about even your neighbors on any of those issues. Living in tents or houses doesn't change the fact you never know. Especially  people with money ,who can afford lawyers to get them off.
Anyone can be homeless, paying off doctors, education, lawyers, etc.  I am highly educated and yes, I have been homeless and not by my doing.  I also worked for the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless for little pay.  I know my clients did not deserve what happened to nearly all of them.  Drugs was an escape for the hopeless; many were very good, kind and caring people.  So, to remedy the trash, put more trash barrels out or recycle bins.  Let the camps be vested in the environment they live.  Right on to the Churches and donations that have gone above and beyond their abilities. Not all homeless are bad but like police, it only takes one or two bad guys to ruin a reputation.  Where can you send homeless people, anyway?  Any place can be bad or good.  Thanks to South Park Hill for getting out of the comfort zone and stepping up to help humanity.  Now, helping young teens becoming independent may reduce future houseless people, but there are no jobs when young ones are competing for the jobs older people need, and VOCATIONS are minimal or non-existent.  Simultaneously, we must work on current homeless and prevent further - and our country does a great job of segregating the poor from the wealthy.  I Love Park Hill because poor, hard working people and the wealthy people care, not just the old growth and old brick homes, but the diversity of my community.  I have lived here my whole life.  ...And, the new transplants join our thinking.  Thanks to you, too.  Thanks, Kozlowicz, NO fear-mongering.
RoSean Howard People are not fear-mongering as much as they are legitimately scared of the element of change a SOS can bring to their doorstep. The way to remedy, or at least lessen and sway people, is to inform not point fingers and all caps NIMBY at them. The website Tim Townsend posted is helpful and may sway some who are on the fence. Park Hill UM did the SOS a tremendous disservice by not getting ahead of the information. Try to remember, all of a sudden word got out a ""homeless encampment"" is being located in the middle of Park Hill. Neighbors are envisioning the encampments in and around Cap Hill that had rat infestation, super spreader events, criminal activity, etc. Being kind to everyone also encompasses those who are scared of how this will impact their neighborhood and lives, not just the homeless.
There but for the grace of God go I. Any one of us could be homeless in a city with astronomical housing prices and few safety nets. How many people lost jobs in the pandemic? How many lost housing due to banks and landlords‚Äô inflexibility once the pandemic hit? It could have been me. It could have been you. We have a responsibility to help our neighbors. My goodness we are so fortunate. I think every day how lucky I am to be fed, clothed, housed, with relative financial security. Don‚Äôt you? Don‚Äôt you ever look around your space and go, ‚Äúholy moly, am I lucky!‚Äù So many of our neighbors don‚Äôt have that. It‚Äôs not our place to judge each one asking why and how they are now unhoused. Instead, let‚Äôs help! Let‚Äôs volunteer at that church if they need it. Let‚Äôs offer odd jobs to those who want them. Let‚Äôs give of our abundance, share so more can have a little. Let us meet our unhoused neighbors with love and compassion, not fear and contempt. We are, all of us, human, and have erred in different ways. Some big some small. Some with the good fortune to bounce back, and some not. But we all deserve grace, and patience, and agency, and help. Don‚Äôt give in to fear. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of thinking you are so different from your unhoused neighbors. There but by the grace of God go we all.
You can volunteer at the existing SOS site to learn more here:
you cannot, as there isn't a story.  
Sara Lange In what way are they treated differently? If someone commits a crime, is arrested and sentenced, at what point does homelessness play a role?
If any of you are so appalled by this you want to sell your house, let me know. Looking to scoop up a single fam on the cheap :)
Same üòÖ
Ooh! Ditto! Something with 3 beds, 2 baths would be great! Happy to take the OP's place off her hands.
It's wonderful to see a church helping to provide shelter and services to the homeless in a city where housing prices are astronomically high. It seems to me like they are living their Christian values.
It seems to me they should shift their focus to reopening their church and school to in-person visits.  That is what people in the neighborhood understood they were moving near.  They understood the traffic, the schedules, the clientele that might frequent those places.  If UMC doesn't feel it's safe enough to open for school or worship, how can they safely take on the task of providing responsible housing?!
How about putting the camps in the Governors and Mayors backyards?????????
It will be a block from Senator Hickenlooper's house.
The backyard argument doesn't include the support services also necessary to pull someone out of homelessness. Perhaps talking with someone in that situation, understanding the trauma of living in a very unstable situation, and all that it takes to recover from it would help understanding. It's truly not a black-and-white situation. Some folks just don't ask for help until it's too late.
Please volunteer at the existing site before you make any judgements. They could use more volunteers. 
That waiver is pretty intenseüò≥ Why aren‚Äôt residents responsible for most of the tasks? It would be a start in learning responsibility I would think.

307,458,3,183906949,Jim Hannifin,South Park Hill,18 Apr,"Regarding PHUMC Safe Outdoor Space. Some people might presume that many of the people who are out on the streets are there because they were criminals, pedophiles, addicts - or at least maybe anti-social, and based on that might oppose a fenced Safe Outdoor Space tent village in our neighborhood. Of course! Mostly they‚Äôre pretty regular folks, though, it turns out.

Our nation used to have a different economic and social framework than we have today. One of the social support structures that our forebears had were their Churches. God bless PHUMC for stepping up to re-take that role.  So far, churches have been the only landowners to offer usable land for Safe Outdoor Spaces to move people off the street curbs.

Regarding S.O.S.s: The difference between the improvement of moving from an apartment into your first house does not remotely compare to the improvement of moving from a tent on a city street-curb, into a tent within a fenced-in enclosure of a church parking lot with san-o-lets, trash service, social structure, electricity, and no fear of having your base ‚Äúswept‚Äù away by city cleaning crews any random day. An S.O.S is still minimal, but is a haven of peace to people who need a haven of peace. 

A precedent: The S.O.S. in the church lot on 16th and Pearl was already built before they decided that they were going to invite everyone from what I saw as the wild filthy crazy ‚Äúun-sanctioned‚Äù camp across the street, to move into the new S.O.S. It‚Äôs what I think a Jesus would have done, but still I expected disaster. (And I was one of the volunteers!) Yet when I visited it two weeks later, and multiple times since, it is a Haven of Peace. There are one or two bright bold larger than life characters, but there is peace and security, and there is healing and grace. It is managed by a firm and loving staff and appreciated by grateful campers.

I do not think the larger neighborhood will be impacted for the worse by this camp. (Note there are background checks because of the nearby day-care, too.) I hope they will be surprised to find that the lot has been transformed into something more humanely beautiful and somehow more tranquil than a barren asphalt lot. And it is only for six months.

Kids can still play. Children have agile perception. Teach kids to be wary, but not afraid. That‚Äôs how I grew up and I feel my life is richer, for it.

These people who will stay in an S.O.S. aren‚Äôt the dregs that a ‚Äúworst-case‚Äù mindset imagines; and we need to do something better than what has been done until now for our fellow humans.  I am proud of this church, and of Park Hill, for stepping up, and I hope that we can crow to the rest of the city: This is what Park Hill does, and you can, too.

Lovely and comprehensive explanation and description. Thank you. What a wonderful faith in action community PHUMC is!!
Jim, does PHUMC need donations of any sort? Cash, food, Cleanup crews? If so, please post a list.
From what I read the proposed site will close December 31 and I didn't see anything about any commitment to relocate the inhabitants to at least equal accommodations. So there is the included mass forced eviction of the space on New Years Eve which would be violation of Article 25 of the UDHR. Another thing I think would be helpful is some structured organized activities available for the inhabitants like occupational therapy
Scott have you read how the SOS/CVC works?
Thank you Jim.
Well said - good for you
I'm glad to hear your sane and humane voice on this.
It's not a 'near-by' children's center. The parking lot is where employees and parents park to drop off kids. The kitchen the kids eat in opens up to the parking lot as well as the gym they play in. I'm sure SOS camps are normally great and I fully support having one in the neighborhood but not at PHUMC.  Find a church that isn't also a preschool or look into one of the many unused parking lots a few blocks north just south of the highway.
150 churches were offered this opportunity.
Proud of Park Hill and of posts like this! People: be sure to turn up for the meeting tonight and the May 1st one to spread the positivity!
Having watched the neighborhood meetings for the Denver Community Church location and visiting with the manager of the Baptist Church location, I am convinced of the value to the residents and of the professional supervision of the sites. I am hoping that we will show hospitality to these new residents in Park Hill during their stay here.

Thank you, Jim, for a very good explanation and perspective.
I support PHUMC in this effort.  What they are doing is profound in the face of so much need.
My takeaway from the PHUMC presentation is this is an already established community living at the First Baptist Church downtown. It sounds like this community has already been screened and the antisocial contingent  have been screened out to a certain degree. Does that assure there won't be problems? No and there will be other homeless trying to join and some problems will occur. Does PHUMC deserve a chance to explore this community project? That's what we're exploring. Could the presentation have been more organized? Yes ,but that will come with experience. That is not what we are discussing .

I would like to hear what the neighbors of Park Hill feel about this- I‚Äôm sorry to sound insensitive, but I saw the debacle in Cap Hill- it was and still is, a terrible dangerous mess-having drugs addicts roaming about - nothing‚Äôs safe as it is. I‚Äôm not sure how this is a great thing. Just my opinion.
They have to shut it down because it is a mess. If you have been near/in the downtown area this past year, it is also a sty. I pass it every time I go to visit my mom. It's  on many street corners. They have to keep moving it around because it gets so nasty and dangerous. Why? Because the people who live there will not keep it clean/safe and the city of Denver lets it  happen ! I don't know who would want to visit this city when it is like this.  I don't go downtown unless I have to. My out of town friends have seen the mess on the national media.
Gina Dunn yep, I used to frequent downtown with my kids and visiting relatives. That's now a thing of the past
It made yahoo news today:
I feel that not all homless are drug attics or alcoholics.  I know I lived in my car for a while.  Yes I was homeless
I guess we didn't get to vote on that? Greeeeaaaaat. I don't blame them, everyone would say ""no"". but what do we matter? We only live here, pay mortgage and lots of taxes...

Who is going to keep the area sanitized and clean of debris that we already see all over the city where these tent cities currently exist?  Not to mention our property values will likely diminish as a result of this horrible decision.. I am all for finding an appropriate location to house our homeless population, but as a tax payer it would have been nice to have had a say in the decision, but instead it was pushed through under the radar!  I mean really, smack dab in the middle of our established neighborhood that is literally a block from our public library and grade school? This is the ‚ÄúWrong‚Äù location and the ‚ÄúWrong‚Äù decision by our state and local authorities.

From the article: Chandler said the collaborative has been in contact with the local neighborhood organizations including Greater Park Hill Community Inc. and will host two community meetings in May to provide more details about the site. The collaborative is also inviting people to tour the existing site on Pearl Street to see how they operate.
Don‚Äôt care how they operate on pearl street... don‚Äôt want it on montview street
Are you familiar with the monitored homeless camp downtown by the capital? If not, please do your research, it will basically be the same thing.  It isnt a tent city with zero supervision.
Really... yes I am familiar and also familiar with the dirty needles, filth, unsafe and unsanitary conditions!  Why don‚Äôt you volunteer to put it in your back yard?
As a volunteer with the Women's Homelessness Initiative and after many visits to the 14th & Grant site to deliver food and water, it is well operated. One of my fellow Park Hill UCC church members volunteered overnight there from 11 pm to 3am, and she, a physician, says it was orderly. The fence is tall, and there is a locked gate. If we need extra monitoring around the perimeter, let's talk with the PH Methodist Church about this as well as determine if additional monitoring is necessary. We can also have our Forest Avenue Parkway patrolled if people are concerned. Ultimately, people using this SOS site are like us and deserve safe shelter until other options are available in our severely overpriced and underserved city. Where else do these people go? The SOS site is safe, quiet, and well managed. We all want safe neighborhoods and living spaces. If there is a concern with what is around it, then contact the local police precinct for additional patrols. The people within the SOS site are peaceful. It is a 6 month permit. Also keep in mind that Senator Hickenlooper resides 1.5 blocks from it. Since we can't build affordable housing fast enough, where do unhoused neighbors go?
Please!
How much is the collaborative group paying this church?  Also are they ensuring no sex offenders are living by the school?  Needle disposals?  üò°
Absolutely!  Great question
Take a walk up Park from Colfax to Larimer..and then back on 22nd. That is what will be coming to your neighborhood
How about 14th close to downtown? Right on the sidewalks , in front of homes and businesses. I wouldn't feel safe walking down there , nor having my kids walk down there
I highly encourage all to find out how these people qualify.  It took almost 30 days to fill the camp on Grant.  Not just everyone can come in whenever they want.
Qualify?  Who cares about qualification... just don‚Äôt want it period!
Go visit the tent camp on Pearl street. The tent camp is run really well and the residents are so nice. My neighbors and I have made dinner and delivered it to their 40 residents.  I live in Congress Park and would be so proud if we would do this too.
God Bless you... keep up the good work
It doesn't make you a bad or uncaring person to not want a homeless camp where you live. It is a serious issue that needs to be resolved and rotating these camps from Denver neighborhood to neighborhood is not a solution, just a bandaid. I would suggest the city of Denver take the $100 million  it is getting from the economic windfall boost of getting the 2021 MLB ALL-STAR game from Atlanta and now to Denver and invest it in solving the revolving homeless camp issue. Also all cities/states are getting a windfall from Biden's 2 trillion aid package, so some of that surplus can go to tackling the homeless camp issue.
Seems like Hancock would want to cleanup the downtown area before the ALL STAR game so I predict we‚Äôll see more of this moving into neighborhoods.
There was a homeless man who used to wander around my block. I‚Äôd see him from time to time and we‚Äôd chat. He was one of the kindest people I‚Äôve ever met...former PTA president at one of our neighborhood schools, and the father of three successful adults - one rather well known. He was brilliant, but ill, and our country failed to meet his needs. So he wound up sorting through my dumpster looking for scrap metal to make ends meet. 
Wake up Erin.  Because we don‚Äôt want human feces and needles next door to a preschool is not too much to ask. This is BS and you know it! Yes Denver is an expensive city to live in. Guess what? Other places are more affordable. They live here because suckers like you enable them. Shame on you.
Some people work awfully hard to hold onto their preconceived notions, even when faced with evidence they are wrong.  So sad to see such closed minds, so much unfounded fear and the unwillingness to learn or contribute.
What does that even mean? You do not know me or my past contributions to society!  I am all about helping others!   The issue is we are exposing innocent children and families to something they did not choose to be exposed to!  Wasn‚Äôt our/their choice.. that‚Äôs the issue!  We all deserve to have a choice and say in our lives...
So where would you like to home them?
Jeff Farquhar  I  Myself no Jeff. I have a roof over my head. but you are the same people who go don't pay rent. Pay housekeepers a $100000 a year to clean their homes. We the people, Find a solution. You go poor people until it comes to your house.  There are schools in every neighborhood. There are young children in every neighborhood. Find a solution. Work together to find a way to get these people off the drugs that need help. Work programs. It will get worse before it gets better. Find ways to help instead of being a just not on my door complainer!
I am also concerned, if the legislators think this is such a wonderful idea, then they should have them set up the camps near their homes, not ours!!!
It‚Äôs near Senator Hickenlooper‚Äôs home.
Don‚Äôt know.. your backyard?  Not mine or our local church, or nearby neighbors.  Don‚Äôt know the answer.. it‚Äôs sucks, feel bad for all.  Think ultimately up to our local gov, but they only push this kind of crap through under radar without most knowing anything about it.. is that ok?  No it is not.  I am done bitching, no real solution other than voicing our opinion..  Good luck to all with this terrible situation
Stop complaining and misinforming. Do your homework and be part of the solution.
Patricia Smith I‚Äôm about done with your misinforming. We aren‚Äôt idiots!! We‚Äôve seen these camps! See ya at the tour on May 1st Pattie.
Dispense with the personal attacks. I work and have volunteered for 4 years. Get to work on the solutions and get informed. I too don‚Äôt want drug dealers and unsafe conditions. Learn the difference.(edited)
It‚Äôs a catch22.  I understand the homeless situation must be addressed.  We have spoken to several homeless people living in their cars and watched the documentary Tent City USA.  
I want to thank Patricia Smith and Michael Davis for the information they provided about the safe outdoor space. I think it‚Äôs fair to be apprehensive but from what I have read about the official outdoor space in Cap Hill, it sounds like it was successful in helping people escape homelessness. And the concerns people had at the start were squashed once the program began. Trying to avoid the not in my backyard mentality (NIMBYism) can be tough, but I‚Äôm happy to know our city is at least trying to help people.(edited)
Thinking the camp at the church will be like the camp at Morley is comparing apples and oranges.  Why the difference is so difficult to comprehend is beyond me.  More camps like the one at the church means fewer camps like Morley.  That's the whole point of this, to help people while keeping them safe from the neighborhood and vice versa.  The reality is that the homeless keep coming and the problem will most likely get worse before it gets better once the eviction moratorium is lifted.  People need hope to recover and the sanctioned camps offer that.  Without hope, people turn to drugs and other activities that drag them into places like the camp at Morley.  They're not necessarily bad people, just people that have had bad things happen to them.  It's not right to deny them the opportunity to pull themselves out of a dire situation by denying them a camp like the sanctioned ones which offer hope and a way out, and instead warehouse them somewhere where you don't have to see them.  This camp isn't being placed in Park Hill to punish the neighborhood - I believe the intent it to spread them throughout the city so all neighborhoods share in the recovery.
I agree there is no comparison to SOS and Morey. It's important that we determine how to avoid that situation, and also to keep in mind how we can show how it's possible to make this work.

Dear Neighbors, our cherished Park Hill has a long history of coming together to serve social justice. Anyone remember the Ghost Post program from 1993/1994? This is the Park Hill I know and where I am proud to live. People have come together for decades, and we are again capable of this. Who participated in the Ghost Post program to keep Halloween safe? The first year we did it, we had brick mobile phones (1994), which my boss donated in the days she worked at Cellular One so each block could immediately report a disturbance. When we come together to participate, it lightens the load. https://denver.cbslocal.com/2018/10/31/ghost-post-park-hill-halloween/

FYI -- Only one neighbor was contacted and very briefly at that,  on Glencoe the Friday before Easter.
Before People call me ""Privileged"" I grew up poor.  My parents had me when they were 18 and we lived in trailer parks as well as an actual camper when I was young.  My parents didn't do drugs, they just had kids too young with no money. They didn't use excuses, they didn't take any handouts, they worked their butts off and saved every penny that didn't go to supporting their kids.  They taught me and my brother what hard work could do.  When I first moved to Denver I moved to the highlands when things were still rough.  I had compassion and would give food or a few bucks to the homeless that sat out on the corners around the major intersections in the neighborhood. That compassion soon faded as I would head out on a run down the cherry creek trail every evening after work and see the same people i tried to help talking to drug dealers on that same trail or literally had needles in their arms as i ran by.  I had my first kid living in that house in the highlands and didn't feel safe running with a stroller down the cherry creek trail with her in it.  As much as i loved that house and neighborhood I CHOSE to move to Park hill for a more stable and safe environment.  So now that I feel like a choice was made for my neighborhood without any consideration i can be angry.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for many of years.  There are jobs out there people even during this pandemic. However, you have to be reliable, hard working, and straight.  So before you all start judging me I will pose this offer.  For any of you that believe this is a good thing and support decisions like this being made without any neighborhood involvement my offer is this:  I will buy anyone that is willing to have a homeless family camp in their back yard for a period of time a nice tent, i'll pay for the utilities, and some additional amenities if you're willing to put my money where your mouth is and support these same people living in your backyard.  Because honestly, the parking lot is in the backyard of people that live on that street.
Lee,
Still no takers to my offer on my original post?  That‚Äôs what I thought!!!
You are being ridiculous. The point of the SOS‚Äôs (as you would know if you had read the description of them, which you clearly have not), is that it‚Äôs not just sticking someone in a tent in a backyard (or parking lot); it‚Äôs connecting them to services such as mental health counseling, job training, and housing resources, providing showers, bathrooms, heating, and electricity, and the end goal is transitioning these people into permanent housing, which the project has had enormous success with. Many of the people housed in the SOS‚Äôs actually have jobs, they just don‚Äôt make enough to be able to afford rent, which, if you‚Äôve looked at Denver rents lately, you‚Äôd understand why.  Please educate yourself about what this project is and how it works before vocalizing your prejudices and preconceptions.
Nice! That‚Äôs what Jesus would do

I agree that helping each other instead of arguing or pointing fingers at one another is important. Many people, including myself, offered to help those that needed support here on Nextdoor.  I had the privilege of helping an older couple by buying them canned veggies, boxed food & water. They were struggling trying to find these items.  I also joined a FB group that focuses solely on helping others. It's called ""COVID-19 Help Group"" in case anyone else wants to join.  Let's help one another & not tear each other down :)
Good job Fran!

I absolutely love this idea. It warms my heart to see Italy and Spain‚Äôs love and appreciation for their medical community. As it should be.
I've just been texting my friends and neighbours, checking in, so that even in isolation we don't need to feel isolated. 
Good work Norma...this too can spread exponentially, right?
My church group is sticking with small groups for prayer and chatting every week as well as virtual service.
Oh! And im trying to get the neighborhood on board with the Christmas lights thing to cheer the neighborhood up!
Wonderful!!
Hey Tom. Up in the NW burbs. We had so many people looking for and seeking help. One started a group to help neighbors in need get help. It's been awesome to see how quickly any need is responded to.  Often by more than a few offering to help. It's awesome to see people put aside all other considerations (race/religion/politics/social status) and just be neighbors and Americans. Please check it out for yourself (if you're able)https://nextdoor.com/g/h14shobyd/(edited)
Good stuff Christopher...I think people helping each other will really surge.  I'm hoping that by sharing these stories we can help it grow - and give folks an idea of the ways that they can help.

I absolutely love this idea. It warms my heart to see Italy and Spain‚Äôs love and appreciation for their medical community. As it should be.
I've just been texting my friends and neighbours, checking in, so that even in isolation we don't need to feel isolated. 
Good work Norma...this too can spread exponentially, right?
My church group is sticking with small groups for prayer and chatting every week as well as virtual service.
Oh! And im trying to get the neighborhood on board with the Christmas lights thing to cheer the neighborhood up!
Wonderful!!
Hey Tom. Up in the NW burbs. We had so many people looking for and seeking help. One started a group to help neighbors in need get help. It's been awesome to see how quickly any need is responded to.  Often by more than a few offering to help. It's awesome to see people put aside all other considerations (race/religion/politics/social status) and just be neighbors and Americans. Please check it out for yourself (if you're able)https://nextdoor.com/g/h14shobyd/(edited)
Good stuff Christopher...I think people helping each other will really surge.  I'm hoping that by sharing these stories we can help it grow - and give folks an idea of the ways that they can help.
I am ordering from local restaurants having the food delivered and giving a generous tip.
I own a Petsitting and Dog Walking business and I‚Äôve been walking dogs for some my elderly clients ! While keeping a safe distance and wearing disposable gloves
Good job...and maybe fun too!
Tom Green, 9NEWS it usually is
Perfect timing...I know so many Seniors who don't  own computers or cell phones...I would Love to see a campaign something like tie a ribbon on the Old Oak Tree..not literally...but a white handkerchief or something on front door...this would let us know they need something..and is friendly for anyone...person who checks can stay 6 ft. Away and help...signs at mailboxes and anywhere  else people could think of....What do YOU....... THINK ....WE ARE GOING TO PULL TOGETHER
An ""old school"" method...might be pretty good right about now.  Thanks Gayle!
Our company is giving take and bake meals to 500 residents at our apartment community tomorrow. We are trying to ease some of the stress and maybe put a smile on someone‚Äôs face during this time. We partnered with a local catering company that has lost business due to the restrictions. 
Wow!  Well done...thanks Jennifer!

Debra thank you so much for the video
I‚Äôm confused by the response of some...this neighborhood is literally within walking distance of colfax.  Do you not see people who are experiencing homelessness all of the time near your home? We live in a city that needs to help people when they are experiencing this.  As a member of this community I am thankful that this church has stepped up to the plate.  I‚Äôm also fortunate to not be in a position where I am dealing with the same hardship.  Perhaps, think of ways you can assist those in need by volunteering your time or resources.  Invest your energy wisely :)
It's the Paradox of Tolerance.
But they are not our neighbors
How so? Homelessness is an issue everywhere even in the ""pristine"" south pkh.
James Love they could have owned property and lost their job due to Covid and got foreclosed on. I rent in the area, am I not a neighbor because I don‚Äôt own? ü§î
And crime rate wont go up? You said that right? Hancock said less police presence at the camps that's a fact. And you are telling people crime rate wont go up? The great fourtion teller you are. On a side note all these people you saying are white privilege are neighbors... and potential clients of yours... yeah you aren't walking my dog anytime soon
Way pastor did it on his own without even telling his public relations professionals until day before he announced to congregation ... in fact he told Denverite News before his flock on Easter morning...

334,485,30,180920051,Laura Avant,Northeast Park Hill,21 Mar,"Save me from myself! I am absolutely not proud about getting good warm clothing to the homeless.  I have been known to raid abandoned homeless camps for clothing to take home to wash and dry and donate to the shelters.  But these last two weeks really took the honors for OCD clothes gathering.  I was down at St. Francis Center giving out  handmade hats and scarves from Knitting for Peace when I noticed a lot of clothing on the ground, in the gutter, and under snow and trash.  I did as an OCD social worker would do and picked them up, put them in my car and took them home.  The items I got last week were washed and dried, folded and sorted and taken to the two shelters I donate to.  
Then Friday I did the same thing again but intended to get it all back to the people there before the snow started and give it directly to them.  I didn't make my own deadline so the two bags are still here while a sleeping bag hangs over the shower curtain.

I would so much rather deal with the nice, clean stylish and warm donations that this community has been offering me, but my donations have dried up lately.  If you can save me from this ridiculous practice of resurrecting dirty abandoned clothing by donating, please do.    I am attaching photos of the latest OCD bags ready to be washed.  

One of the reasons for the unending need for clothing is that COVID has halted the laundry trucks that used to make stops at various homeless areas for people to hand in dirty clothes to be washed and dried and returned to them.  Now when things get dirty or wet, they have no recourse for washing them.  I certainly can't afford the laundry products, hot water, and gas to go down town all the time on my social security, but I would gladly  take cash donations so I can continue to ""resurrect"" these things.  Then I could go to a big laundromat and wash a lot at once.  As with your donations, you may PM me, email me or call at 303-316-6748 to arrange for delivery or pick up.

The Denver City Council will hold a public hearing and vote next week on the final proposal to modernize rules that govern residential uses in the Denver Zoning Code. The proposed text amendment package would give residents more housing options and providers more flexibility to address the needs of vulnerable communities. It also fixes outdated and confusing language, and addresses long-standing equity gaps in the city's zoning code. The final proposal is the result of three years of work and reflects thoughtful compromise from all sides after months of thorough review by the public, the Denver Planning Board and council members.

-How the proposal has evolved since it was approved by the Denver Planning Board last year
-Answers to frequently asked questions
-Clarity and facts to respond to misinformation and misconceptions

Steve, Of course. It‚Äôs their ‚Äúsales brochure‚Äù.... And many valid and objective issues are very gray or not addressed at all.
what issues are not addressed at all?
Chapter 59 Exemptions are still barely being addressed. Pretty disappointed to see an amendment all about equity and fairness leave 20% of the city out.
the Chapter 59 issue (properties still under the ""old"" zoning code) is far more complex than this and touched every other citywide zoning change for the past ten years; that Group Living is the issue that would light a fire under Chapter 59 doesn't make a lot of sense
For the rest of the story:
The Safe and Sound group has been the worst aspect of all of this. Their ""Meet Your New Neighbors"" propaganda video was just disgusting, a grotesque misrepresentation of every aspect of this. 
here's today's Denver Post editorial in support of the amendment; it's a good, brief summary of the issues:
And here is a very thorough discussion by the Denver Gazette that has been following this story much more closely:  https://denvergazette.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-group-living-all-harm-no-good/article_bd6ea004-5c68-11eb-81f7-dbc3cc08a6af.html
If this amendment and it‚Äôs effect were so well addressed that why did a citizen have to go through the courts to get 48 public documents about this amendment? Just saying this mayor and the city Council don‚Äôt always have your best interest in mind. My personal opinion.
Thank you and agreed.  They don‚Äôt have the public‚Äôs best interest in mind on this one.  They did go through the courts and documents and information was hidden from the public. Check safeandsounddenver.com
There are essentially two major concerns of the opposition. Fear of other people, and a desire to maintain property values. Neither is a good look ""politically"" speaking, so they have to launder their position so as not to look selfish or discriminatory. 
Tonia Wilson Ah yes, the ""I know you are, but what am I"" defense. Conjecture does not = facts, and nothing of any substance has been ""uncovered"".
I am most grateful to the extensive research conducted, and advocacy offered, by members of the Safe and Sound group, as well as to members of various RNOs, a few Denver City Council members, thousands of Denver residents, and other stakeholders for expressing opposition to the original Group Living text amendments. Without the research, advocacy, and voiced opposition, the Group Living text amendments would not have undergone revisions in December 2020 that make them a bit more reasonable in their current form. Regardless of how one perceives the tone of the Safe and Sound site, and regardless of how one considers the Group Living text amendments in their current and revised form, the long-term  effects of the proposed text amendments remain to be seen on the increase of housing availability while decreasing housing costs, decreasing gentrification, minimizing neighborhood density, and creating equity in the availability of resources across all parts of the City and County of Denver.

Honest question for those that know: It occurred to me that our wealthiest neighborhoods probably aren't at any risk of being over-run by group homes as the cost to rent these homes would still be astronomical given the amount that would have to be paid.  I also find it hard to believe that a proprietor of group-living homes would look there first for the same reason.  Those homes are just too expensive to reasonably locate a group-home/transitional home in them.  Has this proven true in the cities that have enacted this type of rule?  So, really, this falls to the middle class and poorer neighborhoods to absorb this .... as they do for everything else.  In principal, I'm in favor of this.  Allowing 4 unrelated adults to split a 3 or 4 bedroom home makes so much sense in this housing market. And, if they can afford it - who are we to say they can't?  But, I'm not a fan of pushing this through without addressing the Chapter 59 issue (it defies any attempt to be equitable).  That makes the whole thing sketchy in my opinion.

Exactly. The Chapter 59 conundrum- the 20 % of the city which will not be affected by any of this, those two districts are not even in the wealthiest parts of the city .  Mayor Hancock, coincidentally, happens to live in one of them!
Link to the court docs regarding the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) request to the Mayor's office that was denied, challenged, and WON. 97% of the denied documents were court ordered to be released. This Amendment was cooked up by the Mayor, two at-large councilpersons, and providers of services. The hidden objectives were 1) increase community corrections, 2) increase homeless shelters, 3) increase density in single family neighborhoods because of the City's failed efforts with community corrections-homeless shelters-affordable housing. This is a direct transfer of those failures to hard-working, tax-paying, stable Denverites.

","Next Week: City Council Public Hearing and Vote on Group Living Text Amendments. The Denver City Council will hold a public hearing and vote next week on the final proposal to modernize rules that govern residential uses in the Denver Zoning Code. The proposed text amendment package would give residents more housing options and providers more flexibility to address the needs of vulnerable communities. It also fixes outdated and confusing language, and addresses long-standing equity gaps in the city's zoning code. The final proposal is the result of three years of work and reflects thoughtful compromise from all sides after months of thorough review by the public, the Denver Planning Board and council members. 

City Council Public Hearing on Group Living Text Amendments
5:30 p.m., Monday, February 8, 2012
Virtual meeting via Zoom

Get details at www.DenverGov.org/groupliving including:
-Complete and accurate information on the proposed changes
-How the proposal has evolved since it was approved by the Denver Planning Board last year
-Answers to frequently asked questions
-Clarity and facts to respond to misinformation and misconceptions
-How to participate in the hearing
-How to submit comments

NOTE: Comments to this post are open but are not considered part of the official record to be sent to City Council. To submit comments for City Council to review and to be included in the hearing record, visit the group living project page for instructions (DenverGov.org/groupliving).

Please keep replies respectful and refrain from using profanity or slurs of any kind. Otherwise, the thread will be closed.you‚Äôll find that a lot of the specious claims about this amendment are carefully addressed by the documents on the city website linked above
Steve, Of course. It‚Äôs their ‚Äúsales brochure‚Äù.... And many valid and objective issues are very gray or not addressed at all.
what issues are not addressed at all?
Chapter 59 Exemptions are still barely being addressed. Pretty disappointed to see an amendment all about equity and fairness leave 20% of the city out.
the Chapter 59 issue (properties still under the ""old"" zoning code) is far more complex than this and touched every other citywide zoning change for the past ten years; that Group Living is the issue that would light a fire under Chapter 59 doesn't make a lot of sense
For the rest of the story:
The Safe and Sound group has been the worst aspect of all of this. Their ""Meet Your New Neighbors"" propaganda video was just disgusting, a grotesque misrepresentation of every aspect of this. 
here's today's Denver Post editorial in support of the amendment; it's a good, brief summary of the issues:
And here is a very thorough discussion by the Denver Gazette that has been following this story much more closely:  https://denvergazette.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-group-living-all-harm-no-good/article_bd6ea004-5c68-11eb-81f7-dbc3cc08a6af.html
If this amendment and it‚Äôs effect were so well addressed that why did a citizen have to go through the courts to get 48 public documents about this amendment? Just saying this mayor and the city Council don‚Äôt always have your best interest in mind. My personal opinion.
Thank you and agreed.  They don‚Äôt have the public‚Äôs best interest in mind on this one.  They did go through the courts and documents and information was hidden from the public. Check safeandsounddenver.com
There are essentially two major concerns of the opposition. Fear of other people, and a desire to maintain property values. Neither is a good look ""politically"" speaking, so they have to launder their position so as not to look selfish or discriminatory. 
Tonia Wilson Ah yes, the ""I know you are, but what am I"" defense. Conjecture does not = facts, and nothing of any substance has been ""uncovered"".
I am most grateful to the extensive research conducted, and advocacy offered, by members of the Safe and Sound group, as well as to members of various RNOs, a few Denver City Council members, thousands of Denver residents, and other stakeholders for expressing opposition to the original Group Living text amendments. Without the research, advocacy, and voiced opposition, the Group Living text amendments would not have undergone revisions in December 2020 that make them a bit more reasonable in their current form. Regardless of how one perceives the tone of the Safe and Sound site, and regardless of how one considers the Group Living text amendments in their current and revised form, the long-term  effects of the proposed text amendments remain to be seen on the increase of housing availability while decreasing housing costs, decreasing gentrification, minimizing neighborhood density, and creating equity in the availability of resources across all parts of the City and County of Denver.

380,531,76,181569351,Laura Avant,Northeast Park Hill,27 Mar,"Laundry for the homeless Monday morning, 3/29. I just raided a homeless encampment again on Friday to gather clothing to sort and wash.  Almost no one was there, but there were piles of trash everywhere, so I sifted through (sanitized my hands afterward) and found a lot of useful clothing that was simply dirty or wet or both.   I took it home and have dried out all that is useful and bagged it to be washed and dried.

How would you like to help do the laundry? The laundromat at 20th and Clarkson  (Suds?) will let us do the laundry for free on Monday morning. Carolyn just brought two big containers of detergent, so your labor and maybe some Shout or dryer sheets would help a lot. I plan to be there at about 9:30 with four big bags (soon to be 5) to wash. One young lady who lives near and needs some clothes said she would come help in exchange for clothing and I have one more saint who may come help. 

If you can help, please call me at 303-316-6748 and let me know.  Here are some photos of step 1: drying everything out and step 2: sorting and bagging.  Now it is time for Step 3: Washing and drying.  How about a Step 4 where we meet for coffee before driving home?  It would be a real pleasure to meet any one with enough chutzpah to wash clothing for homeless people who are so often insulted and sold short.  They will be taken to Samaritan House and St. Francis Center within two days of getting them clean.  

For those of us who believe that even homeless people prefer to have clean clothing to wear when they can find it and who try to provide it for free, here is a last desperate step taken by an old social worker.  St. Francis Center gives out clothing on Wednesday and Friday afternoons.  Samaritan House likes to give it to their residents in 4 programs including a family section, but they will give anyone what you need if you go to the door and ask.

I just raided a homeless encampment again on Friday to gather clothing to sort and wash.  Almost no one was there, but there were piles of trash everywhere, so I sifted through (sanitized my hands afterward) and found a lot of useful clothing that was simply dirty or wet or both.   I took it home and have dried out all that is useful and bagged it to be washed and dried.

How would you like to help do the laundry? The laundromat at 20th and Clarkson  (Suds?) will let us do the laundry for free on Monday morning. Carolyn just brought two big containers of detergent, so your labor and maybe some Shout or dryer sheets would help a lot. I plan to be there at about 9:30 with four big bags (soon to be 5) to wash. One young lady who lives near and needs some clothes said she would come help in exchange for clothing and I have one more saint who may come help. 

If you can help, please call me at 303-316-6748 and let me know.  Here are some photos of step 1: drying everything out and step 2: sorting and bagging.

It was parked outside of our house on 12/21/20 for ~48 hours with a woman in the passenger seat. She did not leave the vehicle the entire time. I witnessed her smoking a pipe and dumping liquids outside the vehicle. When my husband approached the vehicle to check on her she shoed him away. Eventually, we called the non emergency police line to report a suspicious vehicle. When the police arrived we heard them state the woman had a warrant for her arrest, followed by them handcuffing her, and taking her away in their police vehicle. Shortly after (~30mins), the police returned with the woman and she remained in the vehicle until next morning when we woke and the vehicle was gone.

Then today when we woke, 1/5/20, the vehicle was parked on the side of our house with the same woman in the passenger seat.

It is a white chevy box truck. The license plate is AZL Q21. I just wanted to reach out to the ND community to see if there have been similar sightings or if anyone has more information.

What I feel is very strange about the situation somebody with a warrant is not going to bail out of jail in 30 minutes there's a reason for the warrant that needs to be squished before they let people go as far as my education tells me. And the cops dropped her off, very unusual maybe she's a confidential informant possibly keeping an eye on somebody in your neighborhood that could potentially be a bigger worry.(edited)
Other than that she's probably just homeless lives in her truck and doesn't have a better part of town to park at the moment, or possibly out of fuel those big box trucks guzzle gasoline. I would think people that are thieves or criminals would not stay in one spot where they can be seen by the same people over and over again. Hard telling not knowing, though I have to agree with you, after the cops it is a rather odd situation.(edited)

We have someone parking in front of our house every afternoon through the following morning in Northfield. He keeps his car on all night.
That same truck was parked in front of my house over Christmas, just after the incident in Tennessee. I notified 311 and I  watched police make contact with them. There are 2 people, one of them likes to yell out loud from time to time. 
Thank you for sharing this information. It is slightly comforting to know that we aren‚Äôt alone. The woman yells often, using profanity and aggression. She seems very unstable. The police also informed us about the 72 hour rule, which leaves me feeling powerless over the situation, as they move every two days.

I know of this because I have a close family member with a meth addiction. They too hang out in their car for hours and hours and even live out of it sometimes months on end.

Thank you for the information. I appreciate you taking the time to share your perspective.
In the meantime- I would go out and get a wind chime and/or a multi faceted crystal that you can hang in their general direction to block the negative chi you are experiencing coming from their direction. I would hang the wind chimes or bells from the cable dish or anywhere outside the sound won‚Äôt be obstructed- and far enough from your bedroom windows. Then I would hang the crystal in the window on the inside of  home. Simple Feng Shui at your service!
Since you are the one who called the cops can‚Äôt you call them and ask what they did or are doing about the warrant? And why they let her stay there? Just curious

That is kind of obvious.  It doesn't mean that we have to accept homeless people who ""may be mentally ill"" possibly leaving needles, excrement or bothering people who live in a nice neighborhood.  Seriously,  what if the issue becomes so great that we have homeless people living in cars up and down neighborhood blocks.  Are you going to say we should just accept it because poor them?  I have helped the homeless on many occasions.  Believe me some of them want help.  Many do not.  They understand how to live on the streets and they are truly comfortable with the lifestyle.   The drug addicts just want their next ""fix"" and will do whatever it takes to get it.  Lisa good luck in helping the woman move along.  For any of you that are concerned about the woman's welfare, don't insult Lisa by patronizing her.  Here's an idea, go find the box truck and offer her a ride to the methadone clinic or to get registered with Denver Health and Human Services.  There is a place right on Colfax just east of Colorado on the Northside of the street that you can take her to get some help.(edited)

thanks for your contribution, jim c.
The Salvation Army doesn‚Äôt help gay, trans, or non-Christian homeless people and their facilities are ripe with abuse. I feel like this is gonna hurt more people than it helps, especially since now people will be arguing that there are more shelters so homeless people shouldn‚Äôt be on the streets when the shelters might be significantly worse.
Lie
Calvin Smith Cindi M. Chloe Adams fake news
Please don't slander an institution when a simple search of their website will prove that the SA serves all who are in need:
The official policy of Salvation Army is no discrimination; but as Yogi Berra said, ""In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is."" The actions of some Salvation Army facilities or programs have differed from their official policy. Their history in this is not great. We'll have to see if these facilities live up to their word.
False comparison. I‚Äôm actually truth the SA does, in fact, serve all. Really, you should try it yourself.
Right, so in a world where needs are great for many of the weakest, endeavor to shut down organizations such as the Salvation Army and Catholic Charities, cancel them, and then send cards to all of those who they have and would have continued providing assistance to, expressing * how sorry you all are for facilitating their continued struggle, but they weren't fair to everyone, according to the expectations of many ,who so often need little help in the same way, at all. *
How many times does it take me unsubscribing when it actually works‚Ä¶
Rick G. I was wondering the same thing! Apparently, now that next-door is curating their own content, they subscribed everyone to it. If you go to your settings, you can unsubscribe from all of this junk.
...or just click the down arrow in the upper right of the post field, and click 'turn off notifications', and then again to click ""hide post'.
The SA Handbook of Doctrine includes some passages that cite a portion of the Bible (Romans 1:18-32), which advocates for the exclusion, in the tamest sense, to the killing of LGBTQ people, in the extreme interpretation. The Salvation Army is not an inclusive organization.
Totally untrue and a simple google search uncovers this fabrication to anyone who actually cares about inclusion. 
What about the Johnson and Wales Campus? 25 acres, turnkey ready, for homeless and transitional housing, and currently for sale. The City says they are committed to this issue, but then depends on other organizations. An additional $41M tax measure was just passed. Seems like more ""talk"" and less ""walk.""
If it makes sense, the city looks the other way. If we had a ""perfect "" city, many people would probably loose their jobs.
I literally know people who were kicked out of Salvation Army shelters for being trans. Their policy doesn‚Äôt necessarily align with their actions.

Total BS. Spreading this type of lie is damaging to anyone and everyone who seeks shelter anywhere. By repeating these lies, you actually damage the challenge of inclusivity by building a straw man argument when there is plenty of actual discrimination taking place.
Forgot to mention that you‚Äôre REQUIRED to pray before they‚Äôll feed you https://mobile.twitter.com/kivanbay/status/934607972415631360
What then, a person gets help on their own terms, w/o any thankfulness for that help?  Should they pray to you?  Honestly, if I were hungry, and in Iran, and for food, for a meal, I was asked to pray to Allah, I would, from my lips, but not my heart, which is the issue; I wouldn't take it personally.
In my experience, any attempt to help is usually grounded in good intentions. The Salvation Army might set policy to be inclusive, but that doesn't mean that a lot of practicing Christians within their organization might not behave in unwelcoming, discriminating or other hurtful ways.
The Salvation Army serves all people regardless of their faith, sexual orientation, gender, or any other issue. Please visit this link to see compelling stories from people about the care they received through this great organization (of which I am not affiliated in any way) - https://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/the-lgbtq-community-and-the-salvation-army/
From my experience when I lived in southern California, the Salvation Army did much good for all of society, providing immunizations, helping cloth and feed the poor etc. I was not religious the thirty years while living there and had no personal experience directly with them other than to get a pneumonia shot and annual flu shots. Everything I heard about the organization was good. I think we currently live in an age where it is considered cool to criticize and tear down everything that has been good.
Check out their website they have a page for LGBTQ support.
The Salvation Army has done great things. If you don't like them don't go and don't donate. But some Radical Haters would rather Salvation Army close and let the Thousand upon thousands they help with food, clothing, shelter, safety, mental help, and love wonder the streets.(edited)
This dragging of the SA happens every year about this time. Folks like to think they are commanding the High Moral Ground when they are actually just showing how easily they can be mislead‚òπÔ∏è
The best way to find out about the Salvation Army is to get off your duff and get a first hand experience! Walk amongst those who need help. The poor, the homeless, and the needy! Holidays are here and they could use volunteers! You will meet some of the finest humble and compassionate people working there. The ""Customers"" are people from all walks of life. Most were living fine lives till disaster hit. Some didn't choose life to go bad, but sometimes it finds them. Others live the drug life even though they were from privileged life! They need help, and the volunteer at Salvation Army, or any other place like them, can provide tremendous help by just listening. Volunteer, and they will find something for you to do. Don't be one of the privileged who has never done anything but sit home and complain about things you have NO experience with. Don't be a complainer - be a supporter!(edited)
This is awesome! The salvation army does so much good. I can't say enough about what they do for people. And not only what they do, but how they educate, help and build people up from thier lowest points in life. From our experience with out discrimination,  or judgement. God has blessed with having them in our lives, and hope to be able to give and help someone in need.
Agreed!  So happy to hear about this!

You're welcome.  And, you're welcome for paid vacations, child labor laws, clean air and water.  And on and on and on.  Liberals did all of that despite Republicans.
Since the Federal Reserve Act our monetary system cannot run without debt. There can never be enough currency to pay back what is owed because Central Banks take a 6% cut, and because of interest owed on money borrowed. If we cut 100% of all spending and collected 100% of the money supply in taxes, we still couldn't pay off the debt. This is why the US Dollar was worth 26 times more in 1913 than it is today. Every time money is printed, the value of money in existence decreases. It's a form of stealth taxation and wealth redistribution that also pays Central Banks for doing nothing but creating ones and zeros in a bank processing system. The appeal is that it's easy money for politicians to spend, makes anyone close to the money creation richer, and it's very hard for the voting public to see or understand. Printing money and giving it to other countries is redistributing wealth from anyone who earns a living in USD or saves in it while paying other countries and Central Banks (who always get their cut).(edited)
Sad but true. The root of all our problems
True.
Well, it sounds like I‚Äôm the only one torn on this minimum wage increase. I don‚Äôt know who it applies to. All I know is that many businesses had to close their doors in 2020, and some are barely hanging on. How is this wage increase going to help them?  If it pushes them over the edge, it hurts us all. Fewer businesses, higher unemployment, higher taxes, more folks out of work. So my question is, why now?  Why not 3-4 years ago when the economy was thriving?  This just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.
Government always knows best
Agreed. If the governor will even let them go to work
Josh, that would definitely be helpful, wouldn‚Äôt it.
So we're up to poverty wages now. To get people the help they need, the minimum wage needs to be $25/hour.
Aston Lopez. You do realize that when that happens, a McDonalds burger is going to cost $15, a soda will be $8, fries will be $10, a movie theater ticket will be $25. To raise minimum wage salaries for minimum wage workers puts everyone in jeopardy to ill afford even the simplest things in life. If you can‚Äôt afford to live on minimum wage jobs get an education or go to tech school. Minimum wage jobs were established for a reason. They used to be jobs that teenagers got or college students or people that wanted to subsidize another income. They were never meant to support a full-time living wage.
I have a question. There is a provision in this bill (from when it was raised to $12.80 in Jan 2020)  that allowed an exception for un-emancipated minors to make less, if the business (such as part time seasonal work) was certified to offer some sort of life skill. However, the process to qualify a business as such did not, and to my understanding still does not exist. So there really is no exception despite the law mandating one. I have reached out to many people on this issue for close to a year now with no answer as to when businesses can be certified, because again, the process doesn‚Äôt exist. Any enlightenment is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.
Hi Brittany,
The higher the pay the more the employee is required to produce a profit for the employer.
So, your solution would be what?  To pay people $2/hour?
I have a tenants who made $9 an hour 40 hours a week. This occupied their time. When the city wage went to like 12 dollars their hours were cut to like 30 hours a week. They had more time on their hands they started drinking more. Now they're running behind on the rent.
Frank H. Aren‚Äôt people who major in economics and finance supposed to be able to find the solutions to all these problems. Where is the wisdom and the geniuses who study this stuff. I know you all don‚Äôt want to hear this, but Trump, pre pandemic, was making inroads to a thriving economy, creating thousands of new jobs, and wage increases were following. Too bad he doesn‚Äôt get another 4 years to maintain that trajectory.
Xcel energy and Denver water cut their employees by over 250. Now they have one person driving by the property to take the electric reading of 20,000 meters and Denver water the same. how many hundreds of thousands of dollars did these companies save by going to electronic meters. Where do you imagine the homeless people came from? They came from companies downsizing so they have no job, house, car, family, etc.
Blame the people at the top who expect the rest of us to supplement their overpaid salaries! When are they going to tighten their belts?(edited)
Any company who can put hundreds and millions of dollars into the Olympics advertising makes way too much money.
I was sickened by the amount of money poured into election campaigning.
Frank Haas I might guess them being behind on rent might be more related to the pandemic unless they‚Äôve been behind for over a year... Also, minimum wage was $9 in 2017. Has your rent stayed the same for the last 3 yrs? when the cost of gas, groceries, rent, and education go up then it would only make sense that the minimum wage would need to go up as well. If heads of large companies would stop overcharging for everything just to overfill their own pockets then the rest of us could continue affording the basics. Stop blaming the regular working man for struggling to play a game created by the rich to benefit the rich.(edited)
My rent has stayed the same.
you are lucky.
This is so stupid
Mr O‚ÄôBrien will be back to lock the conversation down again tomorrow. This went about as well as 2020s edition.
We can only move as fast as our slowest vessel...
Almost always these forced wage hikes result in layoffs and stagnant hiring. Not needed right now.

From Denverite: ""City Council passed the biggest changes to the city's marijuana laws since recreational sales began.""",legalize weed delivery thing know big overhaul city marijuana law pass big change city marijuana law recreational sale begin,"Yep, because the biggest problem in Denver is that drugs are too hard to get.
You do know there a ton of people who rely on cannibas to deal with pain, chemo, and other chronic health issues, many of whom cannot drive, right? This is a really important service. The income from a part time job is also critical given how many people are hurting due to the pandemic
Will they deliver into the house so I don‚Äôt have to get off the couch?
This really becomes ideal if they will deliver fast food and snacks with it. One delivery is better for the environment and traffic.
So many clutching their pearls this morning.   All the BS going on in the world and you're worried about weed being delivered......
Lets see - we can get food delivered, alcohol delivered, clothes delivered, prepared meals delivered and oh yeah pretty much anything delivered these days and weed is legal just like all of the above!!
But of all commodities you list, which would you say would be a good target for say a heist and making a bigger buck on??? Plus the risk of lives being at stake??? Hmmm! ü§îü§îü§î
Our City Council is worthless like the rest of the state political field! ü§®
Why are they worthless, they are growing the conomy?
Well I'm fine with it because I'm not able to get to my grandma or etc who smokes it due to chemo and other health issues I don't see nothing wrong with it how do you think we getting this far due to marijuana it helps others but yeah you know they're going to try to make it where it's not access to people under the 21 I am fine with it cuz I know people who are elderly who smokes it and deals with it and helps with depression and so forth(edited)
Please don't blame old minds, Suleiman. Old ways of thinking, maybe, but not age. I'm old, and I'm in favor of the decision. I like the social equity part too. I hope it won't lead to ""phantom"" owners and will create real economic opportunity.
What‚Äôs social equity?
I'm also for this to the extent there's any chance it will reduce the number of people who might be inclined to get behind the wheel to make a run to the dispensary when they're already under the influence.  Stay home, have it delivered.
Ummm so the illegal job I had when I was 15 is now legal? Great
What was illegal is now legal and what was legal is now illegal. Welcome to upside down world lol(edited)
So effing amazing
Will they have signs on their saying Pot delivery just like liquor stores do.  Don't think I would be delivery person.
Ridiculous....

522,673,218,169420824,Timothy Carter,Hale,Denver Homeless Out Loud,"Lawsuit Proceedings. On December 15th and 16th, 2020, Federal District 10 Judge Martinez will be hearing our case against the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for violating constitutional rights by sweeping people without homes and with nowhere to go - even in a global pandemic. This suit demands that sweeps be halted, at least during the COVID pandemic, to protect the health and safety of the community with and without housing - as in line with CDC guidance. The suit states, ‚ÄúThe CDC issued this guidance because conducting sweeps significantly increases the risk to homeless individuals, and the community, of infection with COVID-19. Despite this clear warning, the defendants chose to act in direct contradiction of public health guidance and to violate the property and due process rights of homeless individuals in a cruel and dangerous manner.‚Äù 

On top of this the suit addresses that, ‚ÄúOver the past year, and in a blatant effort to skirt a settlement agreement entered into between Denver and a class of its homeless population, Denver officials have repeatedly showed up at homeless encampments without notice, flatly told homeless residents to move along (‚Äúto where?‚Äù is the obvious question to this nonsensical command), and seized their property (often discarding it).‚Äù The City cannot get away with these violations of the lawsuit settlement agreement nor with the blatant disregard for the health of those who can‚Äôt afford housing during this pandemic. 

Plaintiffs for this case lost all their property in sweeps, including a mass sweep of Lincoln Park conducted by the City and State together on July 29th, 2020 with no notice. One plaintiff, Charles explains how after gathering all he could in one trip to move from the park that morning, that ‚Äúwhen I returned to the spot where my tent had been, I found that it had been taken and destroyed by Denver officials, along with everything in it.‚Äù Hundreds of people lost all their property in that one sweep. These same hundreds of people have been chased around the City in sweep after sweep since that time. 

Due to COVID regulations people will not be able to attend the hearing in person. There will be a call-in number where the public can listen to the hearing. Stay tuned for this number. We will also be holding a rally and press conference prior to the hearings at 8am outside the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse (901 19th St - 20th and Champa) with safe distancing measures in place.

Apr 27, 2021

The Denver City Council turned a deaf ear to the public before foisting the bitterly opposed ‚Äúgroup-living‚Äù zoning scheme ‚Äî a recipe for neighborhood deterioration ‚Äî on most of the city in February. The council had its fingers in its ears once again this month, when it extended some of that policy‚Äôs profoundly problematic provisions to the rest of Denver.

Had council members been listening, they would have heard deep concern and intense opposition from every quarter. From racially and ethnically diverse homeowners of every social and economic status, representing every point on the compass on the city map.

From supporters for this reckless new policy, however, the council would have heard little more than crickets. And that should come as no surprise given the impact it will have ‚Äî and how few people would want any part of it.

The council‚Äôs February vote sextupled the area of the city where homeless shelters and halfway houses may open, scrapped a buffer between Denver‚Äôs schools and halfway houses and permitted up to five unrelated residents/ tenants ‚Äî and all their family members ‚Äî in any single-family home. The council‚Äôs follow-up action this month extended one of those provisions ‚Äî allowing five unrelated adults to a house ‚Äî to the remaining minority of Denver neighborhoods that were still under the old, so-called ‚ÄúChapter 59‚Äù zoning.

All of the city now can look forward to more cars and trash cans lining the curbs of once-quiet residential streets. More overall noise and congestion, as well. What was once a next-door neighbor‚Äôs single-family home on a quiet cul de sac could become a de facto apartment complex ‚Äî without any of the infrastructure to support it.

Meanwhile, in the majority of the city that will bear the full brunt of the zoning changes, it will mean a homeless shelter or even a halfway house could open in a strip mall near your house. It could be next to day cares, schools, rec centers.

Obviously, there‚Äôs no core constituency for any of that. This sweeping rewrite of the city‚Äôs zoning code wasn‚Äôt a call for action by some broad-based citizens group. Nor was it the recommendation of some blue-ribbon panel of presumed experts. It was in fact little more than the daydream of a roomful of urban visionaries in the planning department at City Hall. It was handed off to the council and then imposed upon the public. Fait accompli; done deal.

Of course, the council insists it really was listening all along; that the planning department hosted numerous forums and engaged with Denver residents in other ways; that the policy was revised to accommodate some objections. Then, absent any grassroots support for the basic plan that remained in tact, the council bulldozed ahead anyway.

So, if City Hall was listening to residents, it also was ignoring them. Which is all the more galling.

Hence, a petition drive now underway to place the policy on this November‚Äôs ballot in hopes of prompting voters to overturn it. Spearheaded by the upstart citizens group Safe and Sound Denver, the petition drive represents a groundswell of opposition by everyday Denverites who are telling City Hall, ‚ÄúNo way. You can‚Äôt do this to our families; our neighborhoods; our lifetime investment ‚Äî our homes.‚Äù

Organizers need around 9,000 signatures by May 13; they are aiming for 15,000 signatures to ensure a place on the ballot. They have been hosting gatherings throughout Denver at which residents can sign a petition, and they have been announcing their efforts via an e-newsletter and a helpful and informative website. Visit the website ‚Äî safeandsounddenver.com ‚Äî for extensive background on the group-living policy itself and for information on how to get involved in the repeal campaign. One of the site‚Äôs pages also offers a lengthy list of neighborhood groups allied with the effort.

As daunting as it can be to fight city hall on any issue, there‚Äôs something uplifting and even heartwarming about this earnest, unflinching and spirited movement to roll back a bad policy. It arguably represents Denverites at their best ‚Äî volunteering their time, talents and energy to band together to push back at a wild overreach by local government.

Here is your chance to stand up for your families, your homes, your neighbors and your neighborhood; for your quality of life. Sign up, and get on board!

It does. I personally know the 1st 300 covid cases were homeless. Who knows what the numbers are now. I am sure they won't say. 
FInding a site that is large enough, close enough to needed support services, capacity for the required amenities, (bathrooms/sinks/showers, etc) and staffing it all is a monumental task. Plus the neighborhood buy-in is critical.  Www.Coloradovillagecollaborative.org/safe-outdoor-space

The neighborhood push back.  The Elyria Swansea neighborhood already has more than it's share of problems, and the residents have experienced numerous issues with the Colosium inhabitants.(edited)
There weren‚Äôt enough bicycles in the neighborhood.

I actually asked a homeless lady at a tent camp near Rockies stadium why they weren‚Äôt going there...    sadly, she was on meth and could barely form a sentence. 
It does. I personally know the 1st 300 covid cases were homeless. Who knows what the numbers are now. I am sure they won't say. 
FInding a site that is large enough, close enough to needed support services, capacity for the required amenities, (bathrooms/sinks/showers, etc) and staffing it all is a monumental task. Plus the neighborhood buy-in is critical.  Www.Coloradovillagecollaborative.org/safe-outdoor-space
The coliseum seemed great from what I had read and not sure why it didn't happen?!
The neighborhood push back.  The Elyria Swansea neighborhood already has more than it's share of problems, and the residents have experienced numerous issues with the Colosium inhabitants.(edited)
There weren‚Äôt enough bicycles in the neighborhood.
Every time a site is selected, the adjacent neighborhoods rise up. The neighborhoods adjacent to the coliseum have to deal with trains, industry, warehouses, I-70.......  it appears that city council finally listened to the residents and decided to not use this site
This is a link to the document submitted to the Mayor's office for a template sanctioned camp. It includes:

Is the western complex still taking in men at the shelter?
It sucks to live in the area , who‚Äôs going to pickup the mess they usually leave behind ?
Right!
Maybe Hancock and city counsel members should offer their backyards for homeless. They'll probably find the solution much faster.

Please let us know what your father might need for his apartment.
Sorry to hear that. 1145 Sherman Street has micro apartments for about 750. You don‚Äôt need a car in that area. King Soopers, Trader Joe‚Äôs, and Whole  Foods are within walking distance.
I had a journey with my brother.  There is a fine line between helping and enabling.  I know your father needs to apply for Medicaid and Social Security and  possibly SSI.  He will be eligible for food stamps and will need a Primary Care Physician to help him get well.  I found it best for my brother to have a Cricket phone and did get him a bank account.  Although my brother did have a multitude of disabilities he was able to work part time at Einstein‚Äôs .  Good luck!(edited)

Good catch Darcy!  Perhaps the cost estimate of 19 mil isn't for a purchase then, but for a renovation, certainly a kitchen and dining area, showers, toilets and sinks, I'm guessing for men & women, possibly even a separate area for married persons; then again, will it be a group environment as with a camp, or individual rooms?  Then the food, the water, the toilet paper, etc., etc., etc..  
Hancock does little for the homeless!
Spends a lot of money on them zero results
It passed but nothing happening. He needs to work at a food bank like the one located at the Denver south hispanic community church open to anyone every Weds. fro 1-3.
With all due respect, Hancock has never spent a moment in office, where he did something FOR the homeless! The policy out of Hancocks office only has a program to do TO the homeless.
Follow the money!  The facts Darcy T posted on the fact that the building hasn't been used since 2016 would make one wonder where the money is now and why the property hasn't been used?  But, is this the real answer or might there be other solutions?
I talked with District Rep. Hines. He remarked that each group is its own community, some with organized leadership, others with no rules. These are fellow human beings and despite all faults and bad choices, they need support. They don‚Äôt want support? Some do.
The government sanctioned camps need leadership and enforcement.
There are two distinct classes of homeless. One is those homeless because of job loss, eviction and other hard-times that have befallen them. They would work if they could find jobs.
From Bill 16-1341:
4330 E 48th Avenue - owned by the City and County of Denver
The city is going to LEASE this property to a PRIVATE OPERATOR, who will make $19M over 10 years.
Do you have an alternative solution?
I wonder what oversight the city plans on having in place to know how the private contractor will be operating the facility in a couple of years.
I think you read that wrong. The lease for the building will cost $19 million/year. (Warehouse space is very expensive in Denver these days, due to legalized marijuana.) There's no mention in the article of who will operate the shelter or how much that will cost. AFAIK, all existing shelters are operated by non-profits.

The City owns the building. In fact, the purchase requisition stated ""Acquire space for use as an overflow shelter and general city storage."" 
My question exactly. We are being played like a fiddle with hanncock at the wheel.
I bet that there has been a fear / concern that once the changes are made to the structure of the building, and the people are in, they'd have a permanent facility for homelessness on their hands, now we know at least as connected to a 10 year lease, and a catalyst for more; Denver, the magnet for the homeless and in need, they will all come for a visit, if you just plant the seed.
please step back from the ‚Äúscandal‚Äù for a second ‚Äî Denver indeed owns 4330 E 48th Ave, but that‚Äôs not the facility mentioned in the too-short article Nextdoor chose to share with us; 4330 has been in operation for several years, currently by Denver Rescue Mission:
Exactly.
This is good clarifying information.  In our age of social media, distrust of just about everybody holding some position of authority, at least insofar as honesty and being up front about mistakes and future plans, the city's media department ought to have considered providing this information to the public, as a service of information, to them (us all).  The homeless dilemma and the accompanying crime city wide are not a small issues, they have been steadily growing for a very long time, and despite being voted down, the inaccurate news from C4 comes a week after our city counsel was reported to have wanted to nix the DPD and create a Peace Force.

Same here, and I got a ticket.  Grr.
AND  REMEMBER it says 8am-5pm in some parts of the city a you can get away with parking AFTER the sweepers go by BUT in other places parking enforcement will double back and write you a $50 ticket
I thought they were waiving the citations for this during the pandemic since folks are working from home, no?
They waived the fines until July, and I knew they were starting again, but still managed to get a ticket. yay me!
Thanks for the pre-warning.  I have neighbors kids that park on my side of the street even though they live on the opposite side of the street.  Not complaining, just hope they don't have to find out the hard way.
It's a better lesson for life, IF they learn the hard way.   Not be critical, just practical.
I got reminded but they didn't come last month to sweep my side street(edited)
When do streets that gave no signs get swept? Dayton between Alameda and the high line canal needs to be swept.
Street sweeping coincides with recycling on my block so the street sweepers go around the purple bins which they haven‚Äôt found a way to ticket yet.
Same for my side of the street on Osceola.  It coincides with waste/recycle pick up.  Can city departments coordinate their schedules so that the sweeping is more effective?
I have tried several times to sign up and get notices. It says I already have an account set up with them but I can‚Äôt remember the password I used. It say I need to reset my password but there is not function I can find that lets me do that.

AND  REMEMBER it says 8am-5pm in some parts of the city a you can get away with parking AFTER the sweepers go by BUT in other places parking enforcement will double back and write you a $50 ticket
I thought they were waiving the citations for this during the pandemic since folks are working from home, no?
They waived the fines until July, and I knew they were starting again, but still managed to get a ticket. yay me!
Thanks for the pre-warning.  I have neighbors kids that park on my side of the street even though they live on the opposite side of the street.  Not complaining, just hope they don't have to find out the hard way.
It's a better lesson for life, IF they learn the hard way.   Not be critical, just practical.
I got reminded but they didn't come last month to sweep my side street(edited)
When do streets that gave no signs get swept? Dayton between Alameda and the high line canal needs to be swept.
Street sweeping coincides with recycling on my block so the street sweepers go around the purple bins which they haven‚Äôt found a way to ticket yet.
Same for my side of the street on Osceola.  It coincides with waste/recycle pick up.  Can city departments coordinate their schedules so that the sweeping is more effective?
I have tried several times to sign up and get notices. It says I already have an account set up with them but I can‚Äôt remember the password I used. It say I need to reset my password but there is not function I can find that lets me do that.

Denver has proven with it's 10-year Road Home that it cannot responsibly undertake this function:
And it turns out that the building Denver purchased 3 years ago for homeless care is being utilized for that cause, effectively, by the Denver Rescue Mission.
The Denver Auditor, Tim O'Brian, has repeatedly pointed out some lack of clarity as to where the tax revenues from the sales of marijuana have been going. This is a lot of money.  So, until the 4 car garage of the house can be cleaned up and it's contents properly accounted for, why build another closet for storage, which will only get bigger.
I think last year we voted yes on tax for mental health for homeless population. Any report how how $ was/is used? Is it getting better.
Not to sound like negative Nancy,  but the more programs you create for homelessness the bigger the population of homeless gets. Just research San Francisco. 
Ha! Well that explains the reason we have so many wild fires, too. We have sooooo many fire fighters so the fires just get bigger and bigger. You should write a book on cause and effect.
The increase is small enough that it won't materially affect most  taxpayers, but it could make a difference for people unhoused people in need of support. But research has shown again and again that the only effective way to end homelessness is to create and guarantee housing, so this incremental effort isn't going to do anything to address the root of the problem.
Can you cite some of your references? I'd like to read more.
I love people debating homeless without rolling up their sleeves and talking to the real people that work tirelessly to help.
Until you have safe, stable housing, you can't address mental health!  It is circular.  One thing is for certain, ignoring the problem clearly doesn't make it go away.
NO
Anyone heard of or read the Denver Green Print Document?  It might interest the public to be aware of such things before voting for this. With the billions we've already dumped into solving this issue and the fact that it's only gotten much worse it seems logical to believe who ever controls these taxes for this purpose are either wildly incompetent or living well beyond their means. Either way I'd council a negative for this tax. And a much much smaller governing body.
I won‚Äôt vote for any tax increase unless it involves abducting vagrant addicts and forcing them into rehab programs that they have to complete. If this violates civil liberties and the ACLU steps then I can‚Äôt vote for it. Programs should guarantee social stability at 90% or more. If I can‚Äôt see efficacy and enough upward mobility then I‚Äôd rather see tax dollars spent elsewhere.
Sam Speight I know what they‚Äôve become. They represent a shell of constitutional rights and their lawyers seem to cherry pick the hot political issues. folks around here talk about helping the homeless addicts but it‚Äôs futile if people are in a place where they can‚Äôt help themselves or care to get help at all. Whether new homeless programs are passed or not, I predict it getting worse without recovery coercion.
When you start feeding the Bears you end with up dependent Bears that won‚Äôt work to feed themselves. As time goes by more and more dependent Bears arrive until there is so many you can‚Äôt feed them all. Then you will become the Bears food.
According to the City Auditor‚Äôs report in 2014, Denver increased spending on The Road Home (Denver's homeless program) from $568,000 to $6,600,128 in the 10 years since it started -- nearly a twelve-fold increase. The problem has increased exponentially. The homeless budget for 2020 = $51 MILLION.

A Census taker with ID was out canvassing today.  I explained I had filed mine online months ago. She started asking direct questions about my neighbors. This is not Russia, I respect my neighbors' privacy, and I consider this an unwelcome intrusion. Scary stuff.(edited)
Wow being asked if neighbors live by you. Yeah bro sounds like a real scary situation! üôÑüôÑ. Try not to stay up tonight scared about it. I‚Äôm baffled by people‚Äôs negative reactions on census. Don‚Äôt you want your neighbors to be counted as well as yourself?
I sent mine in way back before the lockdown and I have received many things in the mail saying it‚Äôs the law to respond to the census as well as calls . Then when you call the number it says there is no way to verify they received it .
The mass mailers are just that. It's cheaper to send out to everyone than to check who already responded.
No need to come to my house we are done it  online(edited)
Facts lol
I completed the Cenus back in March or April as I thought the deadline was in April?
I think they extended the deadline due to Covid
here we go again; Julie, Community Engagement Team i was happy when comments were closed on a couple of recent posts
They can not see our comments, we have asked them to close the posts, obviously a ""no go"" or hit and miss on that subject.  I will monitor for improper posts as best as possible.
Should I complete the census twice like the pres said I should vote twice?
You are kidding. Lets have respect. Please! President Trump was just asking you to make sure your vote was counted and not thrown out by the Democrats!!!
Somehow some folks here don't understand that the U.S. Census began shortly after President Washington took office. We are Americans and need to be counted. Don't make this institution into something political. Think of participating in the Census as important as voting, except that it only happens every ten years. Come on, you can do this successfully 5 times in your adult life without complaining, can't you?(edited)
Well said. I have worked every census since college, and you‚Äôre right ‚Äì people don‚Äôt understand how critical a complete count is. It is so much more than redistricting, and those who are typically undercounted go without the services they need.
LOL
Mark Y. Your own words: ‚Äúan unwelcome intrusion‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is not Russia‚Äù ‚ÄúScary stuff‚Äù.  YOUR words, not mine lol. Covid and climate change are both hoaxes too, right? Lol
Lynn L. What does MAGA even mean? What time in America are Trump supporters trying to return to? I‚Äôm asking out of curiosity because no one has ever been able to give me an answer.
What have the census workers been doing all summer?  They have had five months to visit all non-responding addresses in their assigned areas.  Or perhaps someone at the office is exceptionally slow to update the outstanding address list?  Either way, this seems like a management incompetence issue so typical of government operations.
They purposely wait to allow people time to voluntarily complete the census. That info is available to you.
I thought this forum was for real people who live here
I am real and I do live here.
The operation was shut down on March 18 because of the pandemic. The whole process had to be revamped, and as soon as that happened, work resumed. It has not been easy.
I did my census a long time ago & pretty much stay to myself, but the census taker decided, no matter how many times I told them I don't talk to most of my neighbors, still asked me questions on my neighbors???? WTH???? When I say I don't know, then I DON'T KNOW!!!
I believe you. As David Brooks notes in The Second Mountain, one of the victims of the past three decades of urban planning is the community. It used to be the community that taught , nourished and supported each other. Now we live in isolation and have to turn to government and ngo's for community. It is no wonder you don,t know your community, especially during a pandemic.  Judging from the previous snarky comments in this thread, it is going to take a lot of forgiveness before we can reweave a strong sense of community in this country. At least people are talking , though I wish they weren,t so busy playing the blame game.
It makes me sad that something so important as the Census which determines how federal monies and representation of the people has to become so political.  You are asked a few simple questions.  What are you trying to hide?
Even if I do know anything about my neighbors, I'm not telling anyone.  That is my neighbor's business, not mine.
It's nothing personal. This is a constitutional mandate. It's like, how many people live there and things like that. It helps them be counted so there are enough roads and bridges and schools. Nobody is coming for them in the night or anything.
I don't recall questions about my neighbors
If they can't get a hold of someone they then go to their neighbors to at least get a head count of how many were living in the residents on April 1. My neighbor was out of town due to his father in law being sick then passing away.  So i had someone knocking on my door to get their info.
I called the Regional Census office in Dallas and spoke with a very nice lady.  she said the enumerators (census takers) are allowed to ask certain questions about your neighbors if they cannot get in touch with them.  She suggested to call our local office if you have any questions - 719-257-5049.  I also discussed the problems with people posting comments and using this as a political forum - Again - she suggested calling the local office.(edited)

I am working with a new mom of twins transitioning into permenant housing from a short term extended stay hotel. She is working hard to care for her babies and support her family. She moves in on Monday. Several people have generously agreed to donate furniture (and most other essentials), but no one has a truck to move it. 

Specifically, I am searching for someone who can pickup a full mattress and bed frame in Stapleton on Monday and move it to her apartment at Evans and Dahlia. Less urgently, there‚Äôs a couch near City Park that needs to be moved to the same location. 

I will make sure everyone is masked at all locations. Please let me know if you are able to help this little family out in this way! I‚Äôd be so grateful - and so would they!

Jeannine S. it's kind of like going to get your hair done while your house is on fire.
They may be showing a diplomatic way of changing the atmosphere of that area.  The Corona virus is going to leave a depressing atmosphere on this nation, on much of the world.  It'll take some time for things to bounce back.  The year 2023 is not really that far away, just around the corner when you think of all of the people, just in the greater Denver area, who will be suffering great financial loss, many whom will not recover, many who never recovered from 2009.
That‚Äôs wishful thinking. The mall stretches for miles - won‚Äôt all be worked on at once. 
Yes, I will not argue those points.  It is wishful thinking; as opposed to biting the bullet of accepting that there simply is no rhyme or reason for the indecision, and such decisions made, by the city, in current times.  The start date alone seems to point to creating a positive to look forward to, while looking away from a plethora of problems too wearisome to keep looking at, let alone make decisions to remedy.(edited)
I'm glad they approved it and that local biz are funding it.
With all that is going on that has been a great detriment to local businesses, residents, & customers, it is a thing to look forward to, as we endure this really long and spasmodic pause from what has been normal life, to whatever degree we have been living it.
Watched the July 20 city council meeting and they go into great detail about why all but one council person decided to support the mall renovation.  They also explain why an editorial in the paper doesn't understand the situation under consideration.    Nothing is being cut by this vote from current school funding.  The 33 mil mentioned wouldn't necessarily go to the schools in any case if cut from the mall project. The state might reduce state funding to the schools if it did.  Without it, the mall renovation would likely be impossible for the next 10-20 years and other funding acquired from fed and other sources would almost certainly have to be returned to those sources and fought for again in years to come after it's already been hard fought & put in place now.  Needs and benefits were discussed.   Replay of the meeting is available through the city council website. It's a long meeting.  I believe discussion of this issue is the last agenda item. It's toward the end at any rate but it is a fairly long though interesting discussion.  Fast forward is available.  After listening, Denver Council's decision made a lot of sense to me.(edited)
This project has been in the works for a long time. Infrastructure projects like this have a lot of moving parts and once they‚Äôre in motion, it‚Äôs difficult to just stop them due to a recent event (covid-19). These improvements have been warranted for awhile now and once completed, this could very well change the dynamic of the mall and Lodo. With the mall being more pedestrian and restaurant friendly, more people will be attracted to come and check it out. Not to mention, they‚Äôre adding more mature foliage and green space, which is always a worth-while improvement.
What they need to invest is more security around the mall and downtown areas!!
Not this type of security: https://www.westword.com/news/allied-security-guards-plead-guilty-to-beating-at-denvers-union-station-11055071
Dede de Percin Horrifying!
The Denver Urban Renewal Authority declared this area blighted in order to  use Tax Incremental Funding (TIF) as a redevelopment tool. When TIF is used, all regular taxes are diverted to DURA (and the developer) for 25 years. This means that property tax revenues for schools are diverted, too.
Why are they spending money and city employees have to take furlough days????
Heat Miser!   My Fav!
Jan D. Thanks
How about power washing and disinfecting entire 16th Street mall?
I'd add to the comments here that narrow, bumpy pedestrian walkways create accessibility barriers for people with mobility issues.
I vote we use the money to find a different alternative to downtown tent town.
Maybe they want them wider for the tents though....
The City of Denver's response to the homeless situation is identical to Trumps's response to COVID-19. Denver passed the camping ban, then totally dropped the ball as homeless numbers sky rocketed.  Eight years of this.  Coming up with a Corona virus vaccine seems like it will be easier than coming up with solutions for homelessness in Denver.
What‚Äôs crazy is that there are more places for the homeless right now than ever before.  The coliseum and local schools all opened up for them.  There are tons of organizations that are wanting to help, yet still the tent town grows!
We're simply watching the collapse of the crony Capitalism market.  Our mayor doesn't have a clue and couldn't care less.
Glad that we are getting new pavement. Workers were always repairing it
The city needs to do something with all the homeless people downtown before they proceed with anything that is going to cost taxpayers more money.
What would you suggest ?
I hope somebody will fix Dartmouth east of Sheridan .

Yesterday, Denver moved back to Level Orange on the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment COVID-19 Dial. The move comes with increased capacity limits at many local businesses, including a return to indoor dining at restaurants. 

Level Orange capacity limits include:
- 25% or 50 people, whichever is fewer, indoors at restaurants
- 25% or 25 people, whichever is fewer, at gyms and fitness businesses
- 10 p.m. on-premises last call
- 25% capacity at offices
- 50% capacity remains for retail businesses

It's NOT time...look at what surrounds CO. The 2 week analytics is outdated and not practical
Seems like this is kind of a dangerous thing to do.  I work for the State Health Dept and we get daily updates as to the numbers on COVID related issues.  For the last, at least, 2 days the 7 day average percentage has gone from the low 6% to today was a low 8%.  I'm just scared with new more contagious strain that it shouldn't be the time to let more people gather.

Leslie....Thank you for sharing. That's exactly why the algorithm developed in the Spring doesn't apply now. Then it was an estimate to have a manageable tool to gauge. Now we know too much. The system that Summit County deployed is more practical, yet still flawed because of the tourism variable (personalities willing to travel, same as those who take risk). It does NOT DO SMALL BUSINESS any favors ...in fact, it presents them with a whack-a-mole false tease of they have to go back to lock down on Sunday (which they will if it goes over 10%>>>>and if it is 8% NOW......it is already over 10%).

Looks like they want us to stay home:
Dont forget to wear yr mask and step around the homeless tents on the sidewalk. ü§´
Perhaps those of us with AK47s could get a parade spot??? Just kidding. :-)
No it was just a joke.  I don't want to shoot anyone.  Several people on this website have been discussing buying guns for protection because we have so much crime in the neighborhood lately.  Sorry, I should have realized someone would think I was serious.  Just a stupid joke. No worries.
A parade for all of the businesses lost? The people being evicted soon or the ones foreclosing on their homes? Or maybe it‚Äôs for the record unemployment in the state- will the roly poly Governor be there? Is it a parade for the record number of suicides in the state for the last 3 months? Or it must be for all the lonely people who can‚Äôt get together to worship. Just wondering WTF you think there is to celebrate?
Suicides are down in CO, not up.
People are allowed to gather for BLM peaceful demonstrations, and to gather for defund police violent destruction, and gather in Civic Center Park to live in tents and party-on.  Freedom of speech only applies to some, they have privilege.  The rest of us just work to clean up the mess left behind.
After watching how people rallying in support of law enforcement in downtown Denver this past Sunday got attacked and beat up by hordes of ""Antifa"" thugs, and the Denver Police did nothing per instructions from above, think I'll pass, thanks all the same. I'll just stay home and ""re-imagine"" Denver as the really nice city it once was a very long time ago.
Amen Mary!  Yes.  I too remember.  The violence in every city is horrible.
In reality crime is at historic lows across the nation! Don't watch the lies at the pres rallies.
Just turn off fox news and it all goes away...like a miracle.
Really?  I though MSM wanted it to all go away....
What is MSM?  I like to know what is happening so I read and watch and listen to a variety of perspectives.  Fox shows video you won't see and interviews you won't hear anywhere else.  I wonder why?
Mainstream media.  I have heard them minimize the riots frequently or not report on them at all.  Very few if at all reported on the riot Sunday at Civic Center Park attacking the pro police PEACEFUL protestors.  Some barely got away with their lives.
My hope is that the leaders in power will have the Capitol building cleaned and repaired as well as the buildings and businesses surrounding it.  Take care of the crime and hope that we can come to better and more positive solutions rather than what is going on in our city currently.  A neighborhood parade is nice, but there are bigger issues to solve and hope that there can be unity with various positive solutions.
When people  continue destroying property and attacking people who is going to come together with positive solutions and unity.  I am more realistic than that.  The longer this rioting goes on the more I am disliking this movement.  The value of the original mission has been lost.  Now it is just evil.
Perhaps the parade can showcase the location selected by each city council member for the homeless encampment in their District as requested by the mayor.
That is hilarious Dave.

It would be great to turn it into low-income housing.
The cost would be prohibitive. It would also depreciate all the properties in the area. Personally I think it would be a poor idea.
Richard Boehm üëç
The main Treat Hall is a national registered landmark so it won't be taken down thankfully.
Anna Mccaffrey, i had the similar thought.  The worlds greatest homeless facility
As long as you live far enough away it does not depreciate your homes value.
Richard Boehm yup
Richard Boehm, I live 1/2 block away.  Johnson and Wales would have indoor apartments for every person, no tents or outdoor sleeping.  There are cafeterias, classrooms, shower and bathrooms, theatres.  Great for the city of Denver, a fantastic solution for our homeless issue
What I find interesting is your profile says you live on Glencoe a mile away and not a half block

Are there any thoughts about the property being declared a historical landmark? I have lived a block away for 40+ tears and there's so much history to protect.
See above Donna.  Apparently Treat Hall already is.  As for the rest of the campus....?
Donna, I totally agree with you. I grew up 60+ years with it being Colorado Women‚Äôs College. It has a wonderful history.
Affordable housing in those dorms would be helpful. I think it‚Äôs too early to know what will happen.
Maybe a community center for actual parkhill ?
As I was driving down Colorado Blvd I noticed that there are a couple of abandoned hotel. Also some of the hotels on Colfax. Should be cheap to remodel and use for homeless shelters
Sadly Richard those hotels are being sold to developers who are planning to build 12-story market-value apt buildings with no parking, which will be a new ring of hell to deal with. The neighbors are fighting it.  You are right about them being perfect for low-income housing though. There is no real long term plan to abate the homeless problem in the city.(edited)
","What is going to happen with Johnson & Wales? Does anyone know if there are any plans as to what is going to happen to the J&W campus?So sad. üò™
It would be great to turn it into low-income housing.
The cost would be prohibitive. It would also depreciate all the properties in the area. Personally I think it would be a poor idea.

The main Treat Hall is a national registered landmark so it won't be taken down thankfully.
Anna Mccaffrey, i had the similar thought.  The worlds greatest homeless facility
As long as you live far enough away it does not depreciate your homes value.
Richard Boehm yup
Richard Boehm, I live 1/2 block away.  Johnson and Wales would have indoor apartments for every person, no tents or outdoor sleeping.  There are cafeterias, classrooms, shower and bathrooms, theatres.  Great for the city of Denver, a fantastic solution for our homeless issue
What I find interesting is your profile says you live on Glencoe a mile away and not a half block

Hey, finally some accurate news coverage. Good to see the neighborhood‚Äôs point of view finally represented here.
It‚Äôs sad to see all of you complaining. I lived on Curtis Street across from the homeless shelter on 23rd & Curtis and yes, my car got broken into once, there was always trash around, and the alley always smelled like urine, BUT... I never looked at it being their fault. It is not their fault they are homeless. It is not their fault that they can‚Äôt get into a shelter because it‚Äôs safer on the streets than in a shelter. I met some very nice homeless individuals and ALL of them were trying to look for a job, but their interviews were far south in Englewood or Lakewood. They had no way to get to work even if they got the job. So please, stop complaining so much and be grateful that you are not homeless during a time like this.

It's NEVER enough. (And it never goes where they say it would).

The homeless people will not use them. When Covid first started, they used the National Western Stock building as a temporary shelter. The problem is, most homeless will not use them because they have to follow certain rules that they will not abide by.
Where are they all coming from. Are they displaced locals or transients? Personally I posted a couple of months back creating free camping grounds with toilets, water, showers and trash disposal. They don‚Äôt have to be in city proper. They could be relocated to these site and with free camping this would allow banning camping on sidewalks, parks, easements and along  roadways. This would allow social efforts to be concentrated to those areas and policed. I empathize but creating unsanitary, unstructured, health issues and potentially criminal sites is not an answer.

Effective for 30 days starting Sunday, November 8, all people in Denver should be home by 10 p.m., with certain exceptions, including going to and from work, interstate travel, and getting medical care. During this time, all public and private gatherings of people who are not members of a single household are prohibited, except for limited purposes. 

This is not intended to be a traditional curfew, but rather a restriction on gatherings, business hours, and a guidepost for behavior that will help Denver get through the next 30 days. Any business not defined as critical must close to the public during Home by 10 hours. Critical businesses include, but are not limited to, hospitals, grocery stores, and pharmacies. 

No alcohol sales or consumption after 10 p.m. will be permitted at any facility that sells alcohol, including restaurants and grocery and liquor stores. Restaurants will still be able to offer food takeout and delivery after 10 p.m. Under the new order, groups at restaurants will now be limited to six people from no more than two households, down from 10 people, for the duration of the Home by 10 public health order.

Recreational athletic activities, including organized youth and adult league sports, practices, games, and tournaments, are prohibited. Spectators are prohibited at all post-secondary and Colorado High School Activities Association (CHSAA) sanctioned sporting events.

How about the vast majority of neighborhoods think this specific plan is very flawed and needs to be readdressed with some equity and no special interests on the design team.
More than 80% of every Denver neighborhood strongly opposed this insane bill in the Fall, forcing city council to withdraw passing it. This version is still not acceptable. Council clearly is still failing to hear that they Wirker for us and are supposed to represent our needs and desires.
This GLA is really just changing the ordinance to make money for entities like Queen City Cooperative, other density developers and corrections companies. I mean look who sat on the GLA planning group and pulled Hancock‚Äôs, City Council‚Äôs and Webb‚Äôs strings for two years. And Sarah Wells and the others living at the coop on Cap Hill are Queen City‚Äôs shills...
Queen City Cooperative is literally just some people who live in one house who want to be legally allowed to do so. They aren't developers or anything like that at all. I know who they are and literally they are like teachers, artists, a web developer. They are a chosen family who want to legally be allowed to live like one and want to allow other chosen families to be allowed the same.

Can your  provide some facts for your comments above?  I truly do want to understand the issue. Any genuine information would be welcomed. I don't want to be a NIMBY, but I also don't want neighborhoods damaged.
Here are some facts: https://us17.campaign-archive.com/?u=5d2c19537162f3f275a0316fa&id=3828a42668
How the hell is this what's going to damage neighborhoods? You wanna know why people are living together? It's because they're broke and group living is efficient and more affordable. Maybe if by ""damage"" you mean lower the median income - in that case, you're the problem, not the ordinance.
Ben I would hope everyone can understand you valid point. At the same time, city council members are elected by the residents of Denver and their neighborhood. Their job is to serve the people. Over 80% strongly opposed this proposal and that hasn‚Äôt changed. The majority of Denver has spoken and it is council‚Äôs job to listen.
Opposition from Change.org petition, verified as Denver residents.

We are very opposed to this also. The parking on our street is bad enough now.  We have 4 houses just on our end of the block that have numerous people living in one house and they have between 5 & 10 cars at each house.
Yes and now they are legally allowed to live there, so why don't you mind your own business? Because guess what, you don't own the parking in front of your house.
one small reason i don't own a car. i'm in deeply dense city park west and several of my neighbors are car-less. it can be done. i realize it doesn't work for everyone.
When I see comments on this subject I'm reminded of a quote by the famous Dr. Peter Venkman: ‚ÄúHuman sacrifice! Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!‚Äù
Paige Burkeholder - Wow! Not a single accusation that you just levied at me is true, and I challenge you to show otherwise or retract what you said. If the amendment passes, the only thing I'll be doing is NOT worrying about my property's value, my safety, or my neighborhood's character. You know as well as I do that just because someone supports the amendment, it doesn't mean that they need to do anything personally to help the people who will be helped by it -- no more than you would need to do something personally if you were advocating for, say, extra funding for policing. It's a policy change, not a crusade.
As you can see, she removed her comment, part of which accused me of calling her a white, privileged woman. My conversations with her were were always civil, and I think that I just got under her skin by continually correcting her misinformation.
Here is more information that the City hasn‚Äôt shared:  https://us17.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=5d2c19537162f3f275a0316fa&id=c599bec59d
No one has mentioned another main concerns, halfway houses for drug/criminal/other facilities to be set up throughout the city.  Now they are concentrated near downtown or by correctional facilities.  City Council wants more options where to put them, regardless of bus routes, job availability or easy access to meetings.
This isn't true...halfway houses would only be allowed along commercial corridors.
It‚Äôs only fair the City should be allowed more options! Why should low income parts of town  always be the ones to get these type of places!?
any updates here?
It passed 11-2!
Courtney Copp thank god lol
Well good news or bad news it passed 11 to 2.  So I guess we will see.

","Denver poised to raise group living limit, but some worry move will damage neighborhoods. From The Denver Post: ""High housing costs and a competitive market have even Denver city officials scrambling to find solutions for those priced out ...""Some? How about the vast majority of neighborhoods think this specific plan is very flawed and needs to be readdressed with some equity and no special interests on the design team.
More than 80% of every Denver neighborhood strongly opposed this insane bill in the Fall, forcing city council to withdraw passing it. This version is still not acceptable. Council clearly is still failing to hear that they Wirker for us and are supposed to represent our needs and desires.
This GLA is really just changing the ordinance to make money for entities like Queen City Cooperative, other density developers and corrections companies. I mean look who sat on the GLA planning group and pulled Hancock‚Äôs, City Council‚Äôs and Webb‚Äôs strings for two years. And Sarah Wells and the others living at the coop on Cap Hill are Queen City‚Äôs shills...
Queen City Cooperative is literally just some people who live in one house who want to be legally allowed to do so. They aren't developers or anything like that at all. I know who they are and literally they are like teachers, artists, a web developer. They are a chosen family who want to legally be allowed to live like one and want to allow other chosen families to be allowed the same.

Can your  provide some facts for your comments above?  I truly do want to understand the issue. Any genuine information would be welcomed. I don't want to be a NIMBY, but I also don't want neighborhoods damaged.
Here are some facts: https://us17.campaign-archive.com/?u=5d2c19537162f3f275a0316fa&id=3828a42668
How the hell is this what's going to damage neighborhoods? You wanna know why people are living together? It's because they're broke and group living is efficient and more affordable. Maybe if by ""damage"" you mean lower the median income - in that case, you're the problem, not the ordinance.
Ben I would hope everyone can understand you valid point. At the same time, city council members are elected by the residents of Denver and their neighborhood. Their job is to serve the people. Over 80% strongly opposed this proposal and that hasn‚Äôt changed. The majority of Denver has spoken and it is council‚Äôs job to listen.
Opposition from Change.org petition, verified as Denver residents.

We are very opposed to this also. The parking on our street is bad enough now.  We have 4 houses just on our end of the block that have numerous people living in one house and they have between 5 & 10 cars at each house.
Yes and now they are legally allowed to live there, so why don't you mind your own business? Because guess what, you don't own the parking in front of your house.
one small reason i don't own a car. i'm in deeply dense city park west and several of my neighbors are car-less. it can be done. i realize it doesn't work for everyone.
When I see comments on this subject I'm reminded of a quote by the famous Dr. Peter Venkman: ‚ÄúHuman sacrifice! Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!‚Äù
Paige Burkeholder - Wow! Not a single accusation that you just levied at me is true, and I challenge you to show otherwise or retract what you said. If the amendment passes, the only thing I'll be doing is NOT worrying about my property's value, my safety, or my neighborhood's character. You know as well as I do that just because someone supports the amendment, it doesn't mean that they need to do anything personally to help the people who will be helped by it -- no more than you would need to do something personally if you were advocating for, say, extra funding for policing. It's a policy change, not a crusade.
As you can see, she removed her comment, part of which accused me of calling her a white, privileged woman. My conversations with her were were always civil, and I think that I just got under her skin by continually correcting her misinformation.
Here is more information that the City hasn‚Äôt shared:  https://us17.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=5d2c19537162f3f275a0316fa&id=c599bec59d
No one has mentioned another main concerns, halfway houses for drug/criminal/other facilities to be set up throughout the city.  Now they are concentrated near downtown or by correctional facilities.  City Council wants more options where to put them, regardless of bus routes, job availability or easy access to meetings.
This isn't true...halfway houses would only be allowed along commercial corridors.
It‚Äôs only fair the City should be allowed more options! Why should low income parts of town  always be the ones to get these type of places!?
any updates here?
It passed 11-2!
Courtney Copp thank god lol
Well good news or bad news it passed 11 to 2.  So I guess we will see.

The problem with the state doing it is that they can't get their own computer programs to work. Look at how often everything is down in the state. You would never have any internet service if they were doing it.
Yes, the law was rammed through by telecom lobbyists to make it harder for anyone to compete with them. Those communities that HAVE won locally (Longmont is one exqmple) have seen business growth and consumer satisfaction.
Not just Denver but the state. The internet should be a public utility
Internet as a public utility would allow the powers that be to monitor ALL our private info, etc. Not for me.
Those days are long past. Your cellular posting is monitored as well.
If you use Google, Apple, or Amazon they already have very bit of private information about you.
They need to make it so cable companies have to compete with each other versus only one in each state.
Multiple competitors with a requirement for a basic level so that all school children get it for free to do homework.
Comcast and CenturyLink certainly don‚Äôt prove that private enterprise is the best solution to providing what has become an essential service
of course not, let companies do what they do best, the City has enough on its plate, this seems silly but i may be missing something.  (25years in telecom)
Very true.  The city can‚Äôt even manage the city.
Good grief! Something else the City can screw up
i don‚Äôt know that private enterprise will ever make an essential service equitable, but would folks support rules to make internet services a truly competitive market?
I disagree with this statement. I'm in telecom (and have been for a long time) and my sole job is to sell to small ISPs. There are a TON! Even in Denver. You just need to look them up.
Aimee Rullo i know there are a few small ISPs left; the ones that survived have found niches, such as Forethought that has its own cable in parts of downtown, and focuses primarily on full service business accounts
No!
It works in Fort Collins, it can and should absolutely be done here.
Denver isn't capable of taking care of anything presently and they think they can run this, what a joke. The state isn't anymore capable. Our governor didn't even know there was a homeless camp right outside his windiw.
the ballot issue in question wouldn‚Äôt set up a city internet service, it would just cancel a state prohibition on doing so; that prohibition is a strategic obstacle put in place in 2005
Yes! Give me municipal broadband and someone who I can hold accountable in an election if everything isn't working!
Yes! Look what a tiny town in Chattanooga,TN was able to pull off by taking their internet public: https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/15/9543839/chattanooga-tennessee-just-found-out-its-getting-the-fastest-internet
Yes! Something needs to be done about the availability and quality of internet access not only here but country wide. The government and Ajit Pai have stopped competition from ISP‚Äôs thereby guaranteeing higher prices and lower quality from the provider(s) in your area. Look at Europe and major developed countries and see what kind of internet speed, pricing and quality they have, it puts our country to shame. We need to start somewhere and this is as good a place as any.

They were very active about social distance, but now it seems about everybody is getting relaxed about covid. I work in healthcare and I'm glad to see n hear that some ppl are still practicing social distance. Big thank you.
That King Sooper is horrible for everything. I used to live in Mayfair and avoided that store like the plague. Now that may be literal.
The name says it all: SAFE-way!üòÇ
Yeah, I switched to Safeway too for the same safety concerns.
Safeway is clean and safe, aisle directions, social distancing spacing.  That Mayfair King Sooper is the exact opposite - I will not shop there.
I dont shop there anymore I go to the leetsdale one and there's alot of people there too üòí can barely go thru aisles, I agree tho with the safeway krameria there's not a lot people there looks pretty clean too
They‚Äôve been erratic for months. Let Kroger corporate know. We feel safe at Trader Joe‚Äôs and Sprouts especially the new one in Central Park.  I compliment them every time I go.
Totally agree with Trader Joe‚Äôs- they are wonderful!
Yeah! Trader Joe‚Äôs is the best! Clean, safe and the associates always very helpful and respectful! üëçüèº
We haven‚Äôt shopped King Sooper for months now.  They were slack at the time when it began.   We love Trader Joe‚Äôs/Sprouts we always feel safe there and the Safeway in Lowry. We only shop there the products we cannot purchase at TJ/Sprouts.
Isn't Safeway more expensive? I could be wrong, though. I admit the Safeway in Mayfair is cleaner and more spread out than KS, though.
Ditto to all the above.  I go to KS at 6-7 am on weekday.  Only way it makes any sense.  Safeway seems much better. Just need to break thirty years habit!!
Sounds like a great question for King Soopers management.
They don't care. I know plenty of people have complained, but nothing ever changes.
In this election year, we can vote with our feet. I like Safeway on Quebec and 1st. Immaculate and well organized.
I would also recommend NOT doing curbside pickup at the Mayfair King Sooper.  The last time I did curbside they gave me less than half of my order but charged me for everything.  It took three weeks to get my money refunded.  This included going through their corporate office.  Since that time I have done curbside pickup at the south Monaco location with no problems.  I am thinking of switching to Safeway or Walmart for my curbside orders.
I have had no problem at all with pickup at King Sooper Mayfair.   When they substitute, they charge the lower price.
I was there today and notice the same thing its irritating
I once watched a guy blast a farmers blow out onto the floor in the entrance. No one even flinched.....
I üíØ believe that‚Äôs true
Social distancing seems to have ended the day that masks started.
That store has been a train wreck since Jack left
We should report them to the Department of Health they will be closed down.
Health department doesn't care. There's a store in town with 12 confirmed cases & they list it as 2 & do absolutely nothing.
Really? I know Tri-County Health certainly does. If you report it they go directly to the store
I ordered from them for pick up occasionally as previous order fulfillments have been lacking.  I do the Target drive up in Glendale, it quick and easy.  If they don‚Äôt have what I ordered, I know ahead of time and can figure it out.

The street-sweeping signs are only posted in neighborhoods with high demand for on-street parking.  In neighborhoods farther away from downtown, no schedules are posted and street sweepers simply go around any parked cars.
If your area has no signs then ticketing doesn't apply (may not even be on a set schedule).

665,816,361,157691933,Vrnda Noel,Northeast Park Hill,10 Aug,"C-19 Eviction Crisis. Friends, 

Right now Colorado does not have an eviction moratorium and limited eviction protections are set to expire TODAY!

We‚Äôre once again asking for your help to call on Governor Polis to #KeepColoradansHoused and demand an eviction moratorium to protect Colorado renters. We urge you to contact the Governor‚Äôs office at 303-886-2471 or tweet @GovOfCo  on behalf of our neighbors at risk of losing their home as we work to recover from the pandemic.

Without urgent action from Governor Polis, tens of thousands of Coloradans face homelessness, 300K-400K could be at risk of eviction by the end of the year. We have to make it clear to Governor Polis that our neighbors need action NOW.

We have had numerous conversations with clients in the past few days explaining that evictions have not been stopped at the national or state level, and that the limited protections that do exist expire tonight at midnight. 

Our actions have been moving the needle. Will you join us again in calling on the Governor to #KeepColoradansHoused

Here are some sample Twitter/FaceBook posts:

Thousands of Coloradans are unemployed. Expanded unemployment benefits have expired and Colorado has no eviction moratorium. @GovofCo we need you to step up to protect Colorado families from homelessness in the middle of a pandemic. Follow the lead of AZ and OR and #StopEviction #KeepColoradansHoused. 
The last thing people should be worried about right now is losing their home because they can‚Äôt pay rent. Coloradans need homes to be #SaferAtHome. Students need homes to attend school. @GovofCo please follow the lead of @GovInslee, @DougDucey and @KateBrownOR. #StopEvictions #KeepColoradansHoused. 
Taking the pandemic seriously means keeping Coloradans housed. You cannot be #SaferAtHome without a home. @GovofCo, hundreds of thousands are at risk. Do the right thing, issue an eviction moratorium.  https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk/
Oregon population 4.2 million, Colorado population 5.7 million, OR COVID rent relief $55 million, CO COVID rent relief $20 million, OR; eviction ban till Oct. CO: no eviction ban. @GovofCo follow Oregon‚Äôs lead. https://katu.com/news/local/oregon-distributes-70-million-in-covid-19-rental-relief-energy-assistance
Public benefits are expiring, and many Coloradans are not back at work full time.

Friends, 

Right now Colorado does not have an eviction moratorium and limited eviction protections are set to expire TODAY!

We‚Äôre once again asking for your help to call on Governor Polis to #KeepColoradansHoused and demand an eviction moratorium to protect Colorado renters. We urge you to contact the Governor‚Äôs office at 303-886-2471 or tweet @GovOfCo  on behalf of our neighbors at risk of losing their home as we work to recover from the pandemic.

Without urgent action from Governor Polis, tens of thousands of Coloradans face homelessness, 300K-400K could be at risk of eviction by the end of the year. We have to make it clear to Governor Polis that our neighbors need action NOW.

We have had numerous conversations with clients in the past few days explaining that evictions have not been stopped at the national or state level, and that the limited protections that do exist expire tonight at midnight. 

Our actions have been moving the needle. Will you join us again in calling on the Governor to #KeepColoradansHoused

Here are some sample Twitter/FaceBook posts:

Thousands of Coloradans are unemployed. Expanded unemployment benefits have expired and Colorado has no eviction moratorium. @GovofCo we need you to step up to protect Colorado families from homelessness in the middle of a pandemic. Follow the lead of AZ and OR and #StopEviction #KeepColoradansHoused. 
The last thing people should be worried about right now is losing their home because they can‚Äôt pay rent. Coloradans need homes to be #SaferAtHome. Students need homes to attend school. @GovofCo please follow the lead of @GovInslee, @DougDucey and @KateBrownOR. #StopEvictions #KeepColoradansHoused. 
Taking the pandemic seriously means keeping Coloradans housed. You cannot be #SaferAtHome without a home. @GovofCo, hundreds of thousands are at risk. Do the right thing, issue an eviction moratorium.  https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk/
Oregon population 4.2 million, Colorado population 5.7 million, OR COVID rent relief $55 million, CO COVID rent relief $20 million, OR; eviction ban till Oct. CO: no eviction ban. @GovofCo follow Oregon‚Äôs lead. https://katu.com/news/local/oregon-distributes-70-million-in-covid-19-rental-relief-energy-assistance
Public benefits are expiring, and many Coloradans are not back at work full time. Evictions leave people exposed and in danger. @GovofCo, we need you. #KeepColoradansHoused https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk/

Makes me angry!
They stopped the in person meetings because people were calling them out for doing things like canceling their meetings and not voting the way their constituents want.
Not to mention being mobbed by demonstrators........
Let‚Äôs flood then with 1 message: asylums.  Get them on the record supporting it or not.  You know, any politician of either party who made this their issue would win.
What?
Patrick H. The homeless problem is out of control and we need to bring back state asylums that can care for these people away from downtown.  That starts with the city advocating for it, then getting the governor‚Äôs support and then federal as it‚Äôs a country wide problem.
Will the meeting be televised on Channel 8 for those of us without Zoom access ?(edited)
Probably. It usually is.
Will the zoomers be on tv?
It‚Äôs just what they want....this way they can pass legislation without any face-to-face interaction with their constituents.  Typical of the left leaning city council and the local government.
Right because cons like trump are so transparent
Was driving pass Wash Park on Downing last week.  2 homeless men - 1 could barely stand with the help of the bench, the other on the ground trying to get up but couldn't.  If I wouldn't have had a friend's child, I would have stopped to help.  There were several people walking/jogging within a few feet but didn't bother to help.  I wonder if these were some of the same people who felt the need to attempt to shame me for suggesting money be given to homeless shelters rather than dangerous street corners.  Just sayin', lol.
You‚Äôre welcomed to advocate for bringing back state asylums with us.  Think of it as a large park surrounded by living/medical facilities that takes care of them outside the city. It starts by getting the city council to demand such change.
Deliberative Assembly: A deliberative assembly or body -- the kind of gathering to which parliamentary law is generally understood to apply -- has the following distinguishing characteristics.
The online meetings I've attended have still been pretty robust for communication and deliberation. Around the country there's actually been an improvement in the diversity of attendance at public meetings because of the virtual changes.
i have always liked how Robert‚Äôs Rules described deliberation, and i definitely have had qualms over the years about decisions deliberated by email; virtual meetings have are much better, though
City Council can‚Äôt handle the people questioning their failed policies. How about canceling the $60,000 per day Convention Ctr contract for COVID beds we never needed or used? It runs through 12/31/2020. Do the math, CO could use that money for food banks or other useful issues. Stop the spending for political reasons. This is not a p***ing contest.
It has not been used yet -
Ann B. wake up
Maybe I don't understand but doesn't the City own the Convention Center and is actually just moving money around in paying that charge? What can a few lights and maybe a security guard or two cost. Are they calculating in lost revenue for conventions/trade shows? I e-mailed our council member and, of course, got no response. Can anyone shed light on this?
the city contracts with a private company to operate the Convention Center; under the contract, the city has to pay that company when it uses the facility
Legislating virtually is absolutely not better or comparable‚Äînor does it encourage transparency, accountability, engagement or deliberation. It is also a woefully inadequate replacement for in-person legislating. Virtual participation (allowing testimony for constituents who cannot be there) should augment to allow for wider participation and more transparency- but it‚Äôs a poor substitute for the whole process and no one should be okay with this ever becoming standard operating procedure (in the case anyone argues for it) Being a legislator is not an at-home work opportunity.

Seeing the Bears in old Mile High with my dad.
The old mile high with the floating stands to change from baseball to football!
Front row world series nationals win, 2019.
The Denver Bears late 50's - all the great NY Yankee players came through here - Booby Richardson, Tony Kuebek, Bill Skowlron, Don Larsen, Ralph Terry, and Ryen Duren. The Bears were the AAA farm team of the Yankees.
Tom Connell : If memory serves me correctly, I do believe Billy Martin managed the Denver Bears at one time as well.

Bears at Mile High Stadium... first baseball game of any kind I saw as a kid. At Coors field with my wife and kids right field upper deck, down 3 runs bottom of the 9th bases juiced, Jason Giambi at the plate, crack of the bat and that little white ball kept getting bigger and bigger and the roar louder and the ball was rocketing straight up into our section and we were delirious fiving and hugging strangers.
Andres Galarraga!  The big cat...El Gran Gato!  I loved him!
Watching Coors Field being built ""brick by brick.""
My one and only foul ball that went to the birthday boy sitting behind me.
When Dinger, the dugout dino, hatched from the huge egg at the Mile High Stadium in 1994.
We were there, too, with our now grown children.  Am I ever old!
The old Mile High before the east stands. Denver Bears with Frank Quilici, Ted Uhlaender, Art Fowler, and Jerry Crider to name a few. All up coming, very accessible. Go to lunch or a beer with many of them. You could take a couple of your kids, get  hot dogs, cokes, programs, and thegame for like $6.00 total! Sit among the crowd of 3000! Those were fun days!
Was the old stadium in the same place as the current one?
The original Denver Bear‚Äôs stadium was on South Broadway, Merchant Park.  The baseball park moved to the edge of downtown and became the new Bear‚Äôs stadium later known as Mile High Stadium. When Denver got an AFL football team the baseball park was expanded and became both a baseball park and football stadium.  In 1995 Coors field opened in downtown Denver and the football and baseball park were once again separated.
As a kid, I saw Marvelous Marv Thronberry hit a home run that hit a light bar outside Bear‚Äôs stadium. The longest home run in Bear‚Äôs history.
There was a city dump on the spot where  the Denver Bears was built..we lived just a block from there and remember our parents telling us not to even think of going to scavenge to see what was in the dump.  (I also remember some homeless people setting camp before the dump was destroyed).
With a memorial nod to the Bears; 
Eric Young hit that home run you speak of. üòâ
So many great memories of the Bears,  Zephyrs and the Rockies. Just waiting to experience the next great memory at Coors Field!
The Denver Bears! That was a kick! On a really good night they would probably have 100 people in the stands. Once in a while they would get a few more when they offered 10 cent beer night. What a lot of great memories!
Seeing the Denver Bears at the old Mile High stadium followed by a Mr. Mister concert. It must have been '85 or '86.
Flying home from college (in Boston) to attend the last game of the Rockies vs. Red Sox World Series. We lost, and I had to take a red eye back to Boston that night to be in class in the morning. In my full Rockies gear and face paint. A tad embarrassing, but still one of my favorite memories.
You're a good sport. That must have been a tough week following.

I had SEVERAL treatments and did my own.

698,849,394,154469263,Phillip Astein,South Park Hill,10 Jul,"A Sad Day In Denver. Dear Neighbors,

Yesterday was a sad day in our beautiful city. An event occurred that I found to be quite egregious. 

At approximately 7PM I was at a red light at the intersection of Quebec and 35th. Coming across our path was a GMC Jimmy being pushed backwards into the intersection by a middle aged man. A Woman was in the drivers seat steering. It seemed they were hoping to get the broken down car into the neighborhood over by Brakes Plus. 

I live on Quebec street so it‚Äòs not uncommon to see a fellow commuter dealing with a bad day and a broken car. Usually a Park Hill neighbor will come out and ask if everything is ok. This was different, this man was really struggling to push this car and as the car gained some momentum into the intersection he couldn‚Äôt keep up and promptly tripped and rolled on his back revealing a prosthetic leg. At this point the car was slowing in the middle of the intersection and the man was struggling to get up. Of course, our light had turned green. I jumped out of my car and ran to help push the car to the other side. The man stumbled over and said ‚Äúthank you sir‚Äù. I looked back and all I saw was a bunch of mouth breathers in their cars at the intersection staring at me. 

W....T....F Denver? What happened? How am I the only one that helped these people. We‚Äôre a community! We can do better. Denver showed up in droves for the protests, put the BLM signs in the front yards but people can‚Äôt get out of your air conditioned car to help a fellow human!?  Sad. 

If you are reading this you most likely weren‚Äôt at that intersection but my intention is to remind us all that moments like that, when you are the one in need and vulnerable, are the moments that make a city feel like a very lonely place. Keep an eye out for moments were you can change that please. Our city needs this.

No comments necessary. Just something to meditate on.",sad dear neighbor yesterday sad day beautiful city event occur find egregious approximately red light intersection 35th come path push backwards intersection middle aged man driver seat steering hope break car neighborhood live street uncommon fellow commuter deal bad day broken car usually neighbor come ask ok different man struggle push car car gain momentum intersection promptly trip roll reveal prosthetic leg point car slow middle intersection man struggle course light turn green jump car run help push car man stumble say thank look see bunch mouth breather car intersection stare w t happen help people community well show drove protest sign yard people air condition car help fellow human read likely intersection intention remind moment need vulnerable moment city feel lonely place eye moment change city need comment necessary meditate,"Beautifully said!
You are doing what is so important in this world. Thanks for being the good person that you are.
Thanks for being a great, neighborly example. That's how change happens!

Thank you for reminding all of us to be watchful and to see the needs for our fellow man. It is sad  that we can be sooooo wrapped up in me myself and I that we don‚Äôt See
I had a motorcycle accident at Quebec and 23rd where my clutch stuck and when it engaged the rear tire spun out leaving me on the ground. At least 2 people got out of their vehicles to help me. Just depends on the people and a lot are just too self absorbed
Thank you for stepping up and helping.
Thank you for helping and for this reminder.
Yes and thank you
On the other hand I was  at Colfax & Quebec with a dead battery one day last Fall.  I had barely opened the back of my SUV and pulled out my jumper cables.  The very first car that drove by stopped and asked if I needed a jump.  ""Yes, thank you.""  They parked beside me, and jumped my car and were gone before I could thank them.

I think Phillip is talking to the current landscape- a sign in front of your house is easier than stopping to help 
How time has changed
I witnessed a woman unable to get her car started at 23rd an dexter. Cars honked and no one moved to help. I tried to help her leaving my 5yr old on the sidewalk. A man ran out from the coffee shop and got it into gear. But man was I disappointed in our neighborhood.(edited)

Why do you keep mentioning the signs you said it more than once I think the signs bother you oh well
I was leaving my Drs. office after having hip surgery. I was in the elevator and became weak and dizzy and finally collapsed. The doors opened and the passengers stepped over me to get out but.. no one even asked if I needed help. I'd say we still have a way to go! That behavior would never cross my mind.(edited)
Yes indeed
Whoa. That‚Äôs crazy Nora. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you.
Thank you for being a part of our neighborhood and for the reminder that common decency to someone in need is far more important than slapping up a sign and feeling like by doing that you did your part. We all must watch out and take care of each other . Truly appreciate your stepping up!
This says something about your character.  Well done!  Good to know someone like you is out there in the world!
One positive note that makes me smile whenever I think of it. I was sitting in my car talking with a neighborhood homeless man I had spoken with him often. A young man saw us and stood and watched making sure I was safe. That's class! N

This says something about your character.  Well done!  Good to know someone like you is out there in the world!
One positive note that makes me smile whenever I think of it. I was sitting in my car talking with a neighborhood homeless man I had spoken with him often. A young man saw us and stood and watched making sure I was safe. That's class! N

Leo Schettler thank Leo.  We all appreciate you!
If he happens to be GLBTQ+ you can always hit up Pink and Black which is an org that helps and advocates for inmate rights for GLBTQ+ incarcerated people.
Contact the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition.  https://www.ccjrc.org/  They can point you in the right direction -- wealth of information about the criminal justice system.
Thank you!!
I can help! My law firm brought and won the case that got stimulus checks for incarcerated folks. You can learn how to get the checks from our website - a lot of FAQ‚Äôs and materials there. Feel free to message me if you still need help after reading.
Um, so you‚Äôre a badass! Thank you for being a part of such good work!
Darcy Strayer, thanks for your kind words!
Are you fricking serious? My son is a full time college student and wasn't eligible for the stimulus and this criminal is? What a great America we live in!still waiting for trump to make it great again! That's insane(edited)

Hi Leo, PM me about a different matter.
These two non-profits provide resources for folks once they‚Äôve been released, but they may be able to help answer your question and hopefully help in the future.
Kelly comco I am sure they offer the help for mental illness in the institution he is being housed. My aunt works helping disabled vets who are homeless but finds it impossible to help most of them because they continue to show up at the facility either drunk or high on illegal drugs and they refuse to enter a rehab facility! They then piss and moan saying nobody will help them! In order to receive the help they must stop drinking alcohol and doing illegal drugs but will not,so don't give me another sad story of how these people are victims of the system because they're not! In order for them to receive help they must first want to help themselves. My son is  addicted to methane when he received his $1,200 guess where the first place he went was! Lets just say,he didn't spend the money on new clothes,toiletries or any other essentials he spent it all smoking meth! When said ""guy"" this man is trying to help gets released to do you think the first thing  this ""guy"" will do is enter a rehab or seek help for his mental health?
Mental illness and drug addiction can be very separate issues.  Leo is trying to help a young man not listen to you and your third hand rants about your aunts experiences.  Stay on topic.
I want to thank Pam from the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition for all the help she has given me and my former student, Mike, in solving this problem. She did it all! Problem solved! : )
They are a terrific organization! Remember them on Giving Tuesday!
I agree. Pam and Christie do a great job. Do remember them on Giving Tuesday. They have not been able to host fundraising events as many nonprofits have been in the same situation due to the pandemic.(edited)

Hi Steve.  Maybe you can do a better job of sharing the message many of us are scared in public when we are within 6 ft of someone without a mask.  My understanding those passing close to are at risk.   Several seem to think masks don't apply to them and their rights are being infringed by being asked
Hi, Al. We've been trying to explain why masks work with each story we do. My colleague, Kyle spoke to some of the concerns in a commentary on Friday: https://www.9news.com/video/news/local/next/mad-about-denvers-mask-order-fine-youre-not-rosa-parks/73-c3628f4a-71a5-4b6d-8166-c3f6cb607539
Kay V. Not only by Saudi Arabia and Russia but also by the virus.  There have been lockdowns worldwide.  That affects the demand worldwide therefore affects the US and demand in the US therefore that is why there are layoffs and business struggling (including ours) and closing or declaring bankruptcy.  The price of crude is the lowest ever.  When the price of crude drops this low, oil and gas businesses are hard pressed to sustain themselves.  So all these items contribute to the layoffs.
We have anonymous neighbors leaving painted rocks and plants around my Aurora neighborhood.
That's a really awesome thing

It would be great if you would do informative reports on the various hobby based groups around the metro area and their public education programs. Such as covering trout unlimited and how the do clean up efforts, fish counting efforts and visits schools to teach children. 
I believe it is a positive move on your part & welcome focusing on more upbeat, inspiring personal stories from our local neighbors.  I‚Äôm sick of all the negativity and divisiveness.  Bring it on Steve. üëçüå∏üòÅüíê
Thanks Glori! We've been trying to get out of the negativity and only give people the information they need. It's tough to be upbeat at a time like this - but it's what we all need. I just saw a video in this thread that made my night.
Hi Steve!
Hi Jean!!!
Thanks to David Lee of Harvey Park and Rob Clark for their kindness in delivering food boxes a couple weeks ago to those of us that are high risk.  I believe they are still doing this.  Such a kindness!  They are an example of some of the heroes during this time.
Welcome Steve love your attitude.
Thanks, Etta. We'll see how it plays here.
Yes Steve. More positivity needed
Happy to try to help with that, Andrea V.
Hi Steve.  Maybe you can do a better job of sharing the message many of us are scared in public when we are within 6 ft of someone without a mask.  My understanding those passing close to are at risk.   Several seem to think masks don't apply to them and their rights are being infringed by being asked
Hi, Al. We've been trying to explain why masks work with each story we do. My colleague, Kyle spoke to some of the concerns in a commentary on Friday: https://www.9news.com/video/news/local/next/mad-about-denvers-mask-order-fine-youre-not-rosa-parks/73-c3628f4a-71a5-4b6d-8166-c3f6cb607539
Kay V. Not only by Saudi Arabia and Russia but also by the virus.  There have been lockdowns worldwide.  That affects the demand worldwide therefore affects the US and demand in the US therefore that is why there are layoffs and business struggling (including ours) and closing or declaring bankruptcy.  The price of crude is the lowest ever.  When the price of crude drops this low, oil and gas businesses are hard pressed to sustain themselves.  So all these items contribute to the layoffs.
We have anonymous neighbors leaving painted rocks and plants around my Aurora neighborhood.
That's a really awesome thing
Welcome , we are a great,  helpful. Supportive area. Please add to that and don't in any way confuse or stifle the organic things that happen here.  ü§úü§õ
Done, Roy M.
Welcome to Kendrick Lake area. Your smile is always a good news.  Enjoy a sunset view from our lake. You are doing a good job. Thank you.
Use to live off of Jewel and Wadsworth.  I do miss those sunsets.  Thanks for posting.
Not sure if it counts because CBS covered it when it was just me.. but now we have four steam teachers in our district who has 3D printed over 700 pieces of PPE for health care workers around our neighborhood :)!
That's really cool. I don't mind doing something CBS did or seeing them do something we did. It allows more people to see something positive. E-mail me - steve@9news.com

Good job on the pictures. We hear about so many garage thefts but never seem to get an image. Garages with good bikes seem to be the target sure.
Thanks for posting this. Will you be following up with the police? Our son‚Äôs Specialized mountain bike was stolen out of our garage 5 weeks ago and a friend thinks he saw someone that looked like this minutes later on the bike.
Disgusting! Thanks for sharing
A little note for all, since restraining was mentioned‚Ä¶ if you do try to make a citizen‚Äôs arrest, you need to make sure you have all your ducks in a row, because that can go south for you in a worse way, and lead to you facing charges and finding yourselves on the losing end of a lawsuit, meaning you end up having to be the one to pay out to a thieving POS like that guy.
Or getting inured stabbed or shot yourself.   Your life is not worth the bicycle(edited)
Also look for the magical white van if you see them in the neighborhood. You can search ‚Äúwhite van‚Äù on ND If you don‚Äôt know about them yet (at nauseusm) they are our local beloved bike thiefs.
At least he showed a bit of remorse... seems like most just flip people off and yell at them.  Probably part of a ring and stuck in that life.  Doesn't make it ok, just makes it really sad.
Guessing he‚Äôs only sorry because he got caught!
In general, I think it is always best to report only the facts of a particular incident without imparting any type of judgement or bias.
Did I miss something? Seems Gavin did only report the facts, and without imparting any type of ""judgement or bias"" -- in which I thought he did a good job.
Our garage was broken into and some bikes and musical instruments stolen.  But got one of the instruments back because we had the serial number.  So be sure to record the serial numbers of anything valuable in your garage.
Susan did this happen recently? I am sorry to hear it
Amy Heaton Last summer.  But a different neighborhood since we just moved to Park Hill.  We were over in West City Park.  Thought I was moving to a safer neighborhood.  Guess it's part of city life - we have to be careful everywhere.  But the police were very helpful in getting us our instrument back, thanks to the serial number.  And a homeless woman actually gave my nice bike back to a neighbor - the thieves must have given it to her being a woman's bike and she didn't want it.
Did you speak to him with strongly worded language?
Let‚Äôs just say, Mr. Cullins, I‚Äôm glad my 11-year old was out for a walk with headphones firmly in place. There also might have been some strong finger-wagging. üò¨
I hope you have him the old whatfor, Mr. Graham. I'd expect nothing less. üí™
Do you know if he was wearing gloves? May be connected to a series of other thefts in the area.
Really important question. A bicycle theft ring in our neighborhood was busted with fingerprint evidence.
Gosh, sorry this happened. My garage was broken into recently but I didn‚Äôt notice anything stolen. They took my neighbors bike and went through another neighbors car. I just ordered this camera on Amazon that I heard works great!
Well, he‚Äôs been able to get a haircut in the last few weeks. He‚Äôs better off than most of us.
Yea he definitely didn‚Äôt look homeless. He even had a mask lol
With the rash of garage break ends has anybody thought about putting in a security alarm to ward off burglars.

Had the same experience maybe 3 months ago? 22nd and Kearney. It was closer to midnight. Guy came in through the fence and entered garage through yard. I was in garage, woodworking. I chased him off, he had an accent, apologized, rode off on girlyish mountain bike. Police were called. Sounds/looks like same guy.
What kind of accent? I happened across a guy at the McDonald‚Äôs drive through on Colfax and Krameria who claimed he was from Ireland, he was robbed of his passport, etc. Real emotional story. Especially when you consider he‚Äôd had that exact same problem over a year earlier at the 7-Eleven off of 8th and Colorado.

722,873,418,151220460,"Steve Staeger, 9NEWS",,10 Jun,"Neighborhood Trades. Hi everyone! It's been a little while. Our newsroom has been overwhelmed covering COVID and the protests of George Floyd's death. All of it has been a bit overwhelming, but I wanted to share a happy neighborhood moment from this week and see if you've ever experienced anything like it in your neighborhood.

As I've mentioned far too many times here, I love to homebrew beer. It's a hobby that I've really ramped up to get me through this time at home.  This week I had a bucket of spent grain from a New England IPA I brewed.  I posted on my local Nextdoor to see if anyone needed compost. Mel messaged me that she'd love to use the spent grain and hops to feed her backyard chickens. In exchange - she gave me some eggs (and I threw in a homebrewed wheat ale). I scrambled a few eggs yesterday - they're delicious and you can tell the difference from store bought! She texted me later that the chickens LOVED the grains.  This is the beginning of another great partnership.

What kind of neighborhood trades do you do? I'm in the mood to be inspired. I'm also considering launching a ""Good Neighbors"" segment on 9News weekends.

I think I recall reading somewhere that they DO. They will eat things like windfall fruits that are fermenting.
Nah! No yeast added to those grains so it's just yummy extracted sugars.
I just trade funny Tater stories for smiles
I made a bunch of trades over the past few months. Each one was a great opportunity to meet new people, exchange some goods, and in some cases, clear out some space in the garage or basement. It's a great system for everyone to benefit from :)
When I gave several folks masks I had made for free, they gave me various yummy food items in return!

Also, a quick jaunt off of Platte River trail thru the Highlands can get you out to Clear Creek trail which will take you all the way to Golden. Just to name a few long ones.
I‚Äôm still learning from South Park hill. One more is Westerly Creek trail through Stapleton which will take you out to Sand Creek trail which you can ride across to connect with Platte River trail and go wherever from there.

A good resource is Strava's global heatmap.  It doesn't give you any info on the routes, other than their relative popularity with other cyclists/runners/etc.  But you can filter by activity...

From Hale I ride South zig-zag to Forest southbound to cross Alameda at a wide intersection and then Leetsdale at a light to get to Cherry Creek Trail (CCT) right at 4 Mile Park. Then you can turn East and go to Cherry Creek Park and beyond, or turn off of CCT to NE or SW on HighLine Canal Trail. Or turn West on CCT and head for downtown and the Platte River Trail
Cycleton sells a map Bicycling the Greater Metro Area. It is up to date has all of the trails, bike lanes, bike routes from Brookfield to Highland Ranch
Becky find your way to Sand Creek and Dahlia. Actual Dahlia is a good route. It‚Äôs closed to vehicle traffic but bikes can get through. Take Dahlia north to the traffic light at Sand Creek. At the light right turn across bridge, right turn immediate right turn to bike path.  Take a right on the bike path and your on your way to the Platte bike path. When you get to the path right goes down town left goes to Golden or Brighton. Have fun
So, Dahlia is open for cyclist from Smith Road to 48th (under I70)?
Straight down 12th past cheeseman and you hit cherry creek trail, then go up past rei to 14th (I think) which curves into 29th.  Nice little ride!
Sand creek is good too but a little sketchy in parts
What do you mean by sketchy?
1)  Start in highlands anywhere and take 32nd to Golden.  If you still have a lot of ride in you, you can continue up all or part of Look Out Mountain.

Why not provide dumpsters with regular trash pick up? Why not provide port-a-potties (at least 1 for every 10 people)? And if not that...why not provide housing that residents of this camp can afford according to their info? 

No, instead our City thinks sweeping 300 people to scatter to downtown blocks, down the river, or who knows where else is the answer.

Yesterday was the second day of sweeps at the Arkins encampment. The previous night residents of the camp were told they could not get back into their property - some slept right outside the fence with what they had. Others scattered to who knows where without their property. Others were told they could go in, but if they came back out they could not get back in to get the rest of their property. In the morning, starting around 6am, the City started trashing property - indiscriminately scooping property with bulldozers and bobcats and crains. Anyone who had their property there but was not allowed in lost all their property. One of the only people who got their property yesterday was a woman we helped get back in to get her stuff just before they were about to trash it. 

After the sweep yesterday, police went to numerous other camps around town - many where residents from Arkins moved to - telling them they could not be there under camping ban enforcement. People trying to move from the Arkins sweep were stopped from setting up at various camps - including cops threatening volunteers helping folks move with ‚Äúillegal dumping‚Äù if they unloaded the person‚Äôs property.

Yup
Denver's been a great city since the turn of the century.  Not because of what it's become.
Denver still is a great beautiful city, what do u think it has become?
Thank you Mayor Hancock for making that initial decision to put in place the stay at home order before our governor thought it was necessary. You know what needs to be done and I thank you for what you do
I agree.  It is good to remember that the Governor is responsible for the entire state, which is very diverse.  There is also no doubt that he was well aware of Mayor Hancock's plans, for what is by far the largest most populated part of CO.  These things are a significant decision making factor in politics, not just the emotion, but the details of the region, with the known facts, and those yet to be disclosed.
How do we email our government with a few concerns we have
https://www.denvergov.org/pocketgov/#/report-a-problem  you can submit your concerns here - or if you'd like to speak with someone right away, just call 3-1-1.
Great question...
So how do we get this ‚Äúgridlock protest‚Äù plan to...not happen
I would say:  Don't point any cameras at the crowd.  Don't feed that.
I believe that the people who don't observe the stay at home order should think about this:!
I understand. I just think fear is more destructive than this virus.
Although I expected on my own to keep distancing through the end of the month, I don't appreciate the mayor thinking he knows better than the governor and saying he would determine dates on his own. I haven't trusted for a long time that Hancock does what is best for the citizens, only what will put more money in his or the city's coffers.
Thanks for sharing your opinion, Laura. I'm not sure that it is based in fact, though. I don't think anyone is under the illusion that requiring businesses to close or people to stay at home puts money in anyone's ""coffers"", to say nothing of the tax base we rely on to fund important city services. The Mayor makes decisions based on science and health data- in coordination with the Governor, who by the way, understands that Denver is a densely populated city- where cases/contact/transmission are a greater risk. The Mayor and Governor Polis talk regularly- and the Governor has confidence Mayor Hancock will do what's best for the city he's responsible for protecting. The Governor must make broader decisions for the entire state. We are always coordinating and communicating, and fortunately for all of us, it has worked to our advantage as a state responding with our very best efforts during this unprecedented pandemic.
Thank you to Denver Mayor Hancock, Gov. Polis, and Superintendent of Schools Cordova for being proactive to fight Covid-19; your leadership and expertise is extraordinary. So glad to be a resident of this city at this time.
Thank you. Thank you for being a leader.
Appreciate all the great feedback, suggestions & respectful dialogue!
Folks in West Highland, our area is a second-tier area in the percentage of COVID19 cases. So many people in this neighborhood still DO NOT wear masks when out and/or observe social distancing.
I guess that's not a big surprise given that the Highlands is a more densely populated area.  Where did you find that data? (I'm curious about other areas.)  Thanks!
Appreciate the updates and I am sincerely hoping we all continue to be patient and do the right thing! It helps if people put it into perspective and consider the alternative which is horrible.(edited)
What alternative is horrible? I think shutting down the economy and 20 million unemployed is darned horrible!
I don't see why we can't extend it till late May for example. Denver along with other cities don't have enough testing kits and other resources to handle the continued cases. I see it actually getting worse once people go about socializing and not wearing masks. Only about 10% of people in my neighborhood wear masks and most are senior citizens...it's baffling.  A lot of people are not taking this seriously enough until it actually affects them or their family/friends. Too many people (perhaps 10% or more of the population) are walking around asymptomatic, infecting people around them.
How do you expect people to survive this long? What about the single mothers who are now facing eviction because they cannot pay rent? There has to be some give at some point. People are losing everything.
For once I can agree with Mayor Hancock and Gov. Poliis's way of handling this Quarantine. The issue in Michigan is the strict lockdown covered the entire state when the big issue is SE Michigan and primarily Detroit, (Which by the way wasn't the site of the protest, but it was in Lansing!) Denver unfortunately is very vulnerable thus tighter controls. We are lucky to live mostly in SE Denver, but other parts of this city have some serious issues.
Thanks for bringing it into perspective. From The Big MI and know how unbalanced the oversight is.(edited)
For people who think that think that the ban is unreasonable I ask why ? What are you hoping to gain . Is it your right to do what you want to do at cost and safety of others ?  I can‚Äôt help think that putting your self and others at risk is worth it . Even if the city opens businesses  what is the benefit if that means we have to start social distancing all over again  .
I believe people are growing increasingly concerned with the fact that losing their homes is becoming a very real possibility. Many people in our city live paycheck to paycheck and not being able to work is having devastating consequences for them. It's not about wanting to ""show the government"". It's about fear of being able to provide for their families.
Sara I understand what your saying I to am barely hanging on but I‚Äôd rather stick out a little bit longer than to get sick and have no way to recover because I‚Äôm sick and can‚Äôt get back to work .  To me losing everything is losing a family member .
Mary M.   I don't, of course, know the particulars of your situation. I did, though, come across this resource today which you might want to consider to help get you through:   https://coloradopeak.secure.force.com/ABTPK?Language=EN   üëç üëç
Mayors Office - thank you for all you have done. Please have him contact Our Congressmen and Senators and tell them we need more Covid 19 SBA funds NOW! No Stimulus money yet, and now small business money all gone. Thank you. I have already emailed them. They are not acting yet!

Governors speaking now
When will testing be made available?? Stop saying young people aren‚Äôt worth a test when I have one friend age 30 who died and a second who was in the ICU age 32 for an entire month and was just released yesterday. Neither had preexisting health issues. Yet several of my demographic have shown symptoms and have been denied testing. How can we go on with our daily lives without knowing if we had it or not?? I speaking of current tests while showing symptoms and antibody testing. If airlines can test passengers and get results within 15 minutes so can we. GET TESTS SO WE CAN REOPEN OUR ECONOMY AND ISOLATE INFECTED PERSONS AND AREAS. Why is the government incapable of doing anything. Just get it done! People are suffering medically and financially.
I'm so sorry for your loss :(.  Make sure your friend gets tested again later.  They are finding some test negative after treatment, and then later with repeat testing, they show they're positive again.
You should be able to order extra carts. We have two recycling carts as we generate much more if that than trash and I believe we just called 311 and they got it out to us. We‚Äôve also always told our neighbors that they are more than welcome to throw stuff in our bins once we put them out if they have overflow. Try checking with your neighbors (from a distance!) to see if they have any extra space.

More pain for you silly, pesky, non-golfer, non-developer, NORMAL citizens...  Go back to your hovels and disappear until we waive our magic wands over your heads. 
I wondered myself, why they need two more weeks time for a plan. What have they been doing? They had more ideas in the media about how to prepare for an imaginary worse second wave in the fall than how to deal with real current conditions and pull backs.
I'm glad they're taking the new information that comes daily into account when trying to prevent Denver citizens from accruing massive hospital bills or simply just dying.
I agree, Kay.
A major part of the reason for the delay is the inadequate supply of tests which haven't been supplied by the federal government. Instead, states and municipalities have been told to come up with tests themselves. Not so easy when they have to bid against other states and even work internationally.
Can CDPHE develop tests?
Bad idea!! Another week does nothing. OPEN NOW!!
And your credentials for declaring this are?
How is the city of Denver NOT in lockstep with the state of Colorado??? Hancock is on a Power Trip.
Our population is larger than other cities, and more densely populated. They're trying to prevent us from becoming little New York.
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/22/opinions/denver-1918-lesson-avlon/index.html
The only thing of value I got out of it was how biased it is by calling our current protestors ‚Äúflat-earthers‚Äù.
How is he on a power trip when that is exactly what governor said ‚Äú he advised other counties to do what they felt best for their individual counties‚Äù also most counties now have also extended their order.
Here is an an article on Weld County: https://www.google.com/amp/s/kdvr.com/news/coronavirus/weld-county-is-not-telling-all-businesses-they-can-reopen-commissioners-say/amp/.  
They said they need to mark all the city sidewalks in 6' sections
Maybe we all get it now and those that don't will need to be guided thru this madness and the rest of us know what 2 do?
You can blame the Democrats for that one. Hillary couldn't win a rigged election against the most unpopular Republican candidate in my long lifetime. Now the Democrats are going to nominate...Joe Biden
It‚Äôs a close race to see if Trump, or sheer stupidity, will be Covid-19‚Äôs key asset.
I think those two things are the same.
Mike N. ü§£
Yet somehow construction personnel have made it through the last 6 weeks being out and about every day? When government picks winners and losers those of us outside of any influence with the powers that be will always get hosed. Opening up golf courses was clearly a bigger priority then putting a plan in place for the public sheep that we've become. By the way, read the announcement again. If you look at the list of reasons why we're being forced to remain home by Hancock, things like getting testing equipment are lower than others. Very telling!(edited)
He‚Äôs out in 2023.
Donald: I say the following in jest and with levity...what‚Äôs the point of this? Some people walk slow while others walk fast. I think they‚Äôll need to paint ‚Äúfast‚Äù and ‚Äúslow‚Äù walking lanes! LOL! Hahahahahah
Have you ever driven on Colorado roads? People dont grasp the concept of slow and fast lanes
I agree.  Even two weeks won't help anyone unless we ALL get tested.
If you all want to extend the stay at home order then I believe you should donate your paycheck to the county of Denver. Why should you all get paid when you are not letting families work to put food on the table. This is so wrong! Freedom over Fear!!
Many of us have been laid off, we just don't want ourselves or loved ones to get sick and possibly die. I have others to think about.
Does the Mayor have any stats to support his decision?  I haven't seen any.  Am I missing something?
There are a ton of resources out there. I recommend the CDC website to start.
Ya casi
My question is did the local government discuss this extension with anyone outside of their office or in their sphere of influence? What about restaurant workers? What about salon workers? What about hotel workers?  Did they get any viewpoints other than the echo chamber in which they apparently function?
Think about this...who will go to frequent these establishments, when so many are fearful for their health an their loved ones?
Can we stop picking arbitrary days that this will all ‚Äòend‚Äô? And whoever wrote this post should recognize that getting people‚Äôs hopes up for a swift end, then ultimately extending stay home orders has a strong negative effect on community morale. I know you‚Äôre trying to sound optimistic, but please be realistic.  We should all be preparing for a long recovery. The economy is already maimed. We‚Äôre not going back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô anytime soon. So  Mayor Hancock, please be concise and realistic with the messaging coming out of your office.
I couldn‚Äôt have said it better. Thanks Eric.
What has Hancock been doing?  ""they need time to prepare?""
I so enjoyed reading most of these responses!  Got me fired up for the day!  I‚Äôm adding this to other number of reasons I did not vote for him in the last election.

More pain for you silly, pesky, non-golfer, non-developer, NORMAL citizens...  Go back to your hovels and disappear until we waive our magic wands over your heads. 
I wondered myself, why they need two more weeks time for a plan. What have they been doing? They had more ideas in the media about how to prepare for an imaginary worse second wave in the fall than how to deal with real current conditions and pull backs.
I'm glad they're taking the new information that comes daily into account when trying to prevent Denver citizens from accruing massive hospital bills or simply just dying.
I agree, Kay.
A major part of the reason for the delay is the inadequate supply of tests which haven't been supplied by the federal government. Instead, states and municipalities have been told to come up with tests themselves. Not so easy when they have to bid against other states and even work internationally.
Can CDPHE develop tests?
Bad idea!! Another week does nothing. OPEN NOW!!
And your credentials for declaring this are?
How is the city of Denver NOT in lockstep with the state of Colorado??? Hancock is on a Power Trip.
Our population is larger than other cities, and more densely populated. They're trying to prevent us from becoming little New York.
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/22/opinions/denver-1918-lesson-avlon/index.html
The only thing of value I got out of it was how biased it is by calling our current protestors ‚Äúflat-earthers‚Äù.
How is he on a power trip when that is exactly what governor said ‚Äú he advised other counties to do what they felt best for their individual counties‚Äù also most counties now have also extended their order.
Here is an an article on Weld County: https://www.google.com/amp/s/kdvr.com/news/coronavirus/weld-county-is-not-telling-all-businesses-they-can-reopen-commissioners-say/amp/.  
They said they need to mark all the city sidewalks in 6' sections
Maybe we all get it now and those that don't will need to be guided thru this madness and the rest of us know what 2 do?
You can blame the Democrats for that one. Hillary couldn't win a rigged election against the most unpopular Republican candidate in my long lifetime. Now the Democrats are going to nominate...Joe Biden
It‚Äôs a close race to see if Trump, or sheer stupidity, will be Covid-19‚Äôs key asset.
I think those two things are the same.

Yet somehow construction personnel have made it through the last 6 weeks being out and about every day? When government picks winners and losers those of us outside of any influence with the powers that be will always get hosed. Opening up golf courses was clearly a bigger priority then putting a plan in place for the public sheep that we've become. By the way, read the announcement again. If you look at the list of reasons why we're being forced to remain home by Hancock, things like getting testing equipment are lower than others. Very telling!(edited)
He‚Äôs out in 2023.
Donald: I say the following in jest and with levity...what‚Äôs the point of this? Some people walk slow while others walk fast. I think they‚Äôll need to paint ‚Äúfast‚Äù and ‚Äúslow‚Äù walking lanes! LOL! Hahahahahah
Have you ever driven on Colorado roads? People dont grasp the concept of slow and fast lanes
I agree.  Even two weeks won't help anyone unless we ALL get tested.
If you all want to extend the stay at home order then I believe you should donate your paycheck to the county of Denver. Why should you all get paid when you are not letting families work to put food on the table. This is so wrong! Freedom over Fear!!
Many of us have been laid off, we just don't want ourselves or loved ones to get sick and possibly die. I have others to think about.
Does the Mayor have any stats to support his decision?  I haven't seen any.  Am I missing something?
There are a ton of resources out there. I recommend the CDC website to start.
Ya casi
My question is did the local government discuss this extension with anyone outside of their office or in their sphere of influence? What about restaurant workers? What about salon workers? What about hotel workers?  Did they get any viewpoints other than the echo chamber in which they apparently function?
Think about this...who will go to frequent these establishments, when so many are fearful for their health an their loved ones?
Can we stop picking arbitrary days that this will all ‚Äòend‚Äô? And whoever wrote this post should recognize that getting people‚Äôs hopes up for a swift end, then ultimately extending stay home orders has a strong negative effect on community morale. I know you‚Äôre trying to sound optimistic, but please be realistic.  We should all be preparing for a long recovery. The economy is already maimed. We‚Äôre not going back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô anytime soon. So  Mayor Hancock, please be concise and realistic with the messaging coming out of your office.
I couldn‚Äôt have said it better. Thanks Eric.
What has Hancock been doing?  ""they need time to prepare?""
I so enjoyed reading most of these responses!  Got me fired up for the day!  I‚Äôm adding this to other number of reasons I did not vote for him in the last election.

Here's a quote from the publisher on his radio show:
Looks like Glendale Chronicle is being cancelled.
Yes, I'm under the crazy notion that a person who advocates for school shootings should not be given a platform.
The CCC is a real mixed bag. They have published many articles ghost written by known progressive journalists and community members. They back some of Denver progressive Candi CdeBaca's proposals or at least give them air time and giver credit for representing the interests of her constiuents and not the Hancock gang . And more. On the other hand, they have also aired the views of the far right and featured , for  example, articles by Denise Riech, the Real estate agent who was recently seen taking Black Lives Matters signs off of yards. I read it because I always want to know what the other side is thinking and doing and I appreciate their effort to bring otherwise ignored community opinions to the fore.
Yeah who would want to read an article with actual facts and source citations supporting a trend that just happens to run counter to the prevailing narrative.
Let's turn that around...who would care to read ANYTHING in a newspaper whose publisher hoped for a school shooting to distract from Trump's impeachment?
Paul, it looks like you've also cancelled people from the state of Nebraska? Their opinions also not valid?(edited)
This site has the specific purpose of addressing group living.  I thought we were going to be adults and keep our politics to ourselves. Cuz guess what, no one really cares about anyones politics, we all understand both sides already.
What about the ones that support the group living proposals? See what you did there?
You are so right on, Paul.  Amanda Sawyer, the city Council person that we the people elected into office is there to serve the developers and she knows what she is doing.  The voters did not ask for rezoning, the developers did and Amanda is there to serve them.  I hope we get to vote on the rezoning as our City Council Rep is not doing what is in our best interest.
Actually, members like CdeBaca want to cancel suburbia like other big cities by integrating group housing.
I hate that magazine. It‚Äôs horribly pejorative and skewed
Roger, guess everyone's a racist that disagrees.
That‚Äôs a logical fallacy what you did there.
Jessie Hardy my point exactly.
No rezoning for Sawyer and CdBaca.
I think this is a web of issues.  A year ago, CC denied the renewal of contracts for the halfway houses/treatment facilities in the community corrections space.  Ms. C'deBaca said the companies were not acceptable because their parent companies contract with the federal government at the boarder.  You all know the narrative on the boarder issue. From what I can see, the issues are not resolved and CC is looking for alternatives.  This failure to renew those contracts and failure to come up with alternatives, so far, with multiply the homeless population as well as add to the narrative that there isn't enough inexpensive housing.  These are issues that CC has created to open the door to begin the march, with the YIMBYs to make Denver like Portland.  This Group Living issue is just the first of many attempts to destroy our City.
There are other problems.
Don‚Äôt like the racist paper or the racist idea limiting access to affordable homes
A decrease of 30/month is not a burst.
While I do enjoy crackin' open the old Nextdoor to read a bunch of people mindlessly repeating the word ""canceled,"" like it means anything in this context besides pro-Trump signaling, the fact of that paper's worthlessness is well established. 
There were serious issues with the for-profit halfway houses and community corrections facilities. The solutions are not easy but are important. This is about people‚Äôs lives. So is the issue of homelessness- which is complex and getting mush worse with recent job losses. Ms C de Baca is impressive- she is looking for better solutions and she respects the people she serves.
The Denver Planning Board passed the Group Living Amendment 9-0 moving it forward in the political process..

First of all, I want to thank any of you who chose to donated to our microgiving campaign after last week's post. You joined Next viewers in donating $90,000 to the Wildland Firefighter Foundation. I'll be sure to share tomorrow's cause as soon as Kyle tells me what it is.

In the meantime, I figured I'd share this photo. This was our furnace filter when I replaced it last week. We're pretty good about replacing it once a month. I'd replaced this one less than a month ago. Might be a good idea to check yours if you haven't in awhile. 

Our air quality continues to be horrible with wildfire smoke, ozone and the heat. Hang in there!

My landlord won't replace mine more than twice a year, and is very crabby about even that frequency!!  It was last replaced in December!  :-(
My landlord won't replace the filter at all - said we need to do it if we want it done . . . and can't tell us what kind of filter to buy either.(edited)
I understand it's your landlord's responsibility but filters aren't expensive and it's your health that's at risk.
Thank you! We just move to the area and on my last house (in Florida) we changed it every single month. Here the maintenance guy said they change 2x a year. I was like üòÆ. We ask them to come and check (so I could see where it is located) and for sure now I‚Äôll change more frequently because we‚Äôre the ones breathing it.
I had a furnace guy tell me to do it once a month to make life easier on the furnace.
This is why some landlords are known as slime-balls vultures.  I don't think every month is needed (if it is you have other issues causing this that need to be fixed) but twice a year is what i do, between seasons.  every quarter isn't bad either, i just found with my set up twice is year is fine, my filter isn't even that dirty after 6 months.  Also a pro tip, DO NOT buy the most expensive strongest filters, it makes your unit work extra hard.  I buy the mid grade, red package Filtrete.(edited)
Thank you doing it now Steve.
We replace our filters (our unit has two) regularly as well.  I read your post to my husband and he went and took a look.  Both filters were just filthy and he replaced them.  Thank you for sending this suggestion along.
Thanks mine looked the same !
so did ours!
Wow- eye opener!
Thanks for the reminder! Mine needed to be changed, too!
I was just thinking about doing that. Tomorrow‚Äôs project. Today‚Äôs was cleaning windows.
What about window a/c units? Do they need maintenance?
Some have a removable mesh screen filter that you flush with water, dry and slide back in.  It will make it easier for the unit to run, too.
Be carefull washing the filters, they tear easily.
Maintenance isn't entering units unless it's an emergency due to covid-19, so I'm sure I'll have to do it myself.
I had our maintenance people being one to our apartment door and leave it and we swapped it out ourselves.
cheap furnace filters are the best. The high efficiency filters can cause your furnace to work too hard.
I get mine in Walmart. $4.58 each...but as I mentioned I do change mine every month
I thought we only had to worry about this in the winter so I haven't check mine since like February, yikes! Thanks for the suggestion.
I do mine once every 6 months in a 2200 sqft hosue with both heat and air..  When seasons change is when i do mine.... my filter is not even dirty.  So it depends.  I would check every 3 months, and change every 6 month at the latest.
I change my filters every month
Kimberly - do you have central air - if you do it goes through the furnace and the filters need to be changed year round!
Thank you so much, that makes much more sense now. We actually do not have central air so I'm sure we're fine but I'll still give it a check.
We usually don‚Äôt replace ours every month but something told us to take a look because of the smoke and ours was awful!

I have a friend who works with the homeless in downtown Denver. While the Coronavirus may actually pose little real threat to most of us, it poses a huge threat to those whose immune systems are already compromised. Thanks to all the people who CAN use soap and water (i.e. have regular access to SINKS) there is no hand sanitizer to be found anywhere. Yes, soap and water work fine IF YOU HAVE REGULAR ACCESS TO RUNNING WATER, which the homeless do not. 

My friend has gotten his hands on hundreds of small bottles that we need to fill with hand sanitizer to pass out to the homeless. Yes, we can make our own hand sanitizer but we need roughtly SIXTEEN GALLONS of it to fill the need! Hand sanitizer is basically just three parts alcohol with an alcohol content of 90% of above to one part emollient such as aloe vera or vegetable glycerine.  Most stores are also sold out of even the supplies needed to make it. 

We can purchase four gallons of alcohol for $100 and one gallon of vegetable glycerine for $12. If you can order either one and/ or donate or contribute, we need about $340 to make the sixteen gallons of hand sanitizer we need. That will fill 500 two-ounce bottles and provide one refill for each of those bottles. If you can donate or contribute, here are the links:

A neighborhood woman panhandler (often head/hoodie covered)- who is well known to Safeway and to police- has been regularly, aggressively panhandling in the Safeway parking lot. She usually has her young son (?age 7-9) (hoodie covered) with her. This week is the second time in the last couple of months that she appeared out of nowhere around dusk/dark and has rushed to approach me at my car asking for money. The first time she literally stood between my open car door and me, blocking me from entering my car. This week, I was maneuvering to get my elderly father in the car when I saw her rushing across the parking lot towards my car. My husband was the last to get into our car so she rushed him as he opened his door, calling him a ""white SOB"" when he declined to give her money. She is very intimidating, and it all happens so fast that you may not initially realize what is occurring until she is in your face or space. I have spoken with the Safeway store manager, and learned that the police are involved.  She is ""trespassing"" when she is in the Safeway parking lot or in the store (all store property). Police have advised that customers should avoid interacting with her, and should not give her money or gift cards on their property at this point, because this has only served to increase her aggressive/persistent behavior.

Champions Park Apartments is doing a great job of providing social distancing by providing only 36 parking spots for over 480 apartments, no public parking available either and booting those that park in the wrong spot.

There's one more option. Barb McMahon at 1212 Garfield collects clothing - you can leave bags or boxes on her front porch - and distributes it through a thrift store which opens its doors to homeless folks two days a week. If I can find the name of the thrift store I will post it here by tomorrow.
The store is The Humanity Store at 2526 Welton St.

Hi Kim I ask for your donation to, for new released incarcerated women from prison. The prison is my ministry thru my church, and I work with them trying to help prevent recidivism, most of their crimes r from getting involved with the wrong people and drugs. They r required to work when they are released and most don‚Äôt even have clothes to leave with let alone go to thrift stores to buy any. All of the suggestions are good, because I have worked with the homeless as well.  Many have asked society to forgive for their sins, but some are not forgiving at all, but if they want to be forgiven of their sins which everyone has and really realize who the real Judge is then maybe people wouldn‚Äôt be so judgmental about everything especially on ND, seems to be a big problem.

This does not mean that COVID-19‚Äôs threat to your health has passed ‚Äì it remains very real ‚Äì but city and community leaders are planning and beginning to implement a path forward that preserves community health and safety, while balancing it with economic well-being.

‚Ä¢ Face coverings are now mandatory while inside of or waiting in line to enter any retail or commercial business, or any location or facility offering government or health care services, and waiting for or riding on public transportation. Learn more at https://bit.ly/2xLiqPV. 

‚Ä¢ On Saturday, May 9, some businesses will gradually begin to re-open with strict social distancing and face covering guidelines in place, including precautions to limit both the number of employees onsite at a given time, as well as the number of customers. Public and private gatherings of more than 10 people will continue to be prohibited through May 26.

It really makes more sense to let the unemployed workers go back to work by reopening businesses With so many people forced out of their work the only people left with income to tax are those receiving government checks. Do the math.
Good points
Sure glad to see we are moving forward.  With that said, we need to get restaurants/bars open at with protocols.  Why wait until the end of the month?  This should be happening asap for the hospitality industry.  They are the ones hardest hit and most likely will not recover.
First we need to see if what the current re-opening of businesses is working to prevent more people going to the hospitals with the virus. Remember we can't over whelm the hospitals again with a bunch of sick people. Who will care for you or anyone else who gets the virus if the hospitals don't have staff. There was already a shortage of nurses prior to the pandemic. Nurses having to work 12 hour shifts away from their family and any social life.
Its time to protect the older and those who have poor conditions but open the rest to the public   its time to open the economy and let us all go about our business .. Im 66 but believe its time to let the people go back to work
I agree Chuck G
Maybe before we raise taxes we should look at cutting expenses. Unemployment has been paid into the system by the employers and the Government should not have been living off of that money.
How about social security disability for people who claim to be disabled so they can get a check each month, but they are out skiing, running, and doing odd jobs, but yeah they are disabled to work a regular job. This is where there is a waste of money.
We have more sites now but you still need a doctors excuse. I ask my doctor for a letter and she told me if I have a problem breathing go to emergency room. At that point it‚Äôs too late anyway. I‚Äôm still not clear it seems even if in early stages they can‚Äôt really do anything. I guess antibiotics wouldn‚Äôt even work I‚Äôm confused is it just a death sentence it‚Äôs like why bother even if a systematic is that what we are looking for, no matter what you should be wearing a mask. Saw a lady trying to go into Walmart and they said no mask no come in, then I was in line at Walmart Stapleton and they were going down the line giving them to people. I have seen young and old running around without a mask like it‚Äôs not going to happen to them, I think there is something I am missing I even bought gloves. I went to the beauty shop today, it was not business as usual, have to say I kinda liked it.

No worries I appreciated her concern for following the rules. She was very cognizant of the guidelines and following them.
Antibiotics do not work with viruses.
I have two granddaughters that work at Walmart they get temp checks everyday they report to work.

But remember, bars and restaurants (and retail) can open up but they will still continue to struggle and many more will permanently close because 58% of the population still won‚Äôt patronize these businesses.  And the unemployment will continue to increase as the domino effect takes hold.  My fear is that this is only the beginning.  My tiny speculation.
They want them to expand to the outside so not in a closed in situation, but my question is what do they do in inclement weather.Somehow they still need an enclosure.
It is the beginning of more pain. Hence my issues and hope for a discussion of how this will all be paid for. The secretary of the treasury said today on the morning news that poorly managed states and cities won‚Äôt get bailed outs.  Personally I‚Äôm in favor of reopening completely, protecting and aiding the old and weak, and reducing spending during these times. We all have to bear the brunt of the pain sh term or its going to be much more expensive long term.
Kate W. ‚ÄúUnless we‚Äôre dead‚Äù?  That‚Äôs a shocking comment.  Let‚Äôs look at the total body of info.  Small % of people are dying. Those who generally  are have preexisting conditions, older, or immune compromised.  Can‚Äôt stop the world to protect the weak. If world is running we can afford to do such. If we‚Äôre not working how do we pay for helping these people who need it.  How do we produce and maintain our food, medical, home goods, industrial, pet, children supplies..... list is too long. We can‚Äôt shut the world down in perpetuity.  Money has to come from somewhere.(edited)
Kate W. Exactly, like they say learn from history or you are doomed to repeat it.
With the Spanish flu pandemic they were released to soon 1918
So if we‚Äôre re-opening that must mean we have the recommended testing and contact-tracing capacity-oh wait- no we don‚Äôt.
I heard a comedian sum it up this way: ""It's a few-hundred more feet to a safe landing, but parachutes have slowed our rate of descent. If we take them off now, MOST people won't die.""
Steve C. No, that pic is of the state budget.
It‚Äôs simple math. What is the size of the population? What percentage of those people need to be infected to reach herd immunity? What is the fatality rate of the infection? 
Your math is off. Your assuming the medical treatments and ability to handle this virus are not getting better. Sorry buddy.  I don‚Äôt agree at all.  There are no vaccines but there are plenty of treatments that works well above 50% of the time to heal people, some as high as 80% depending on the patient.(edited)
China and the nature of their government have historically lied about this and leadership of our country in the past has reacted accordingly. Trump is obviously not prepared to be a leader and still is not making testing and contact tracing a priority. Trump has a lot of blame to take during this yet he refuses to take any blame. Every president in history says things like the buck stops here but a reality show tv star as a president is quite obviously a recipe for disaster. Makes me want George W to come back even
Oh, I was with you until the last sentence. That guy failed to heed warnings of likely terrorist attack, lied us into two wars, oversaw the outsourcing of America's largest manufacturers, then stood by during the subprime mortgage crisis -- which has been established as the trigger for the Global Financial Crisis, and the unemployment rate doubled during his administration with the final numbers at 53 consecutive months of job losses ""peaking"" at 800,000 jobs lost in December of 2008.
jonathan d. No worries. I don‚Äôt agree with your assumptions or death rates. Your facts are your beliefs.  Mine come from differing info. Let‚Äôs not debate such. We won‚Äôt agree.  Rather be a friendly neighbor in the end. Cheers
Perhaps because it‚Äôs impossible to eat and drink and wear a mask to prevent spread?
It‚Äôs still a chaotic fiasco.   
So, now the staff in the Whitehouse have the virus. People who work close to the P & VP have the virus.
Yep. Watch how they overcome it with meds and rest. Not everyone‚Äôs dying.

Thank you for organizing! I will try to join and will keep an eye out for future demonstrations in the neighborhood if I can‚Äôt get there tonight
Thank you so much for this!! It's great that parents are providing a safe place to show their support with their children. There have been many unsupervised children downtown causing mayhem during these and sadly this detrimental to the cause. I encourage parents to please be aware of where your children are during these protests. I was working in aid stations all weekend and there were plenty of teenagers trying to seek refuge after damaging police cars or starting fires. These acts only reflect poorly on the organizers that are trying to demonstrate peacefully. Thank you!!
Great idea to teach kids a peaceful way to stand up for what is right.
Extend yourself further
Support Black businesses 
Thank you for sharing.  This is a great resource - easy to search with links to all the stores.
I was there tonight. It was great. The support  seen and felt was encouraging.
We were too. Our daughter got to safely protest her rights as a young black woman at the ripe age of 12. 
Just saw this. Is it happening tomorrow night too? I just saw a peaceful protest in Austin that turned bad but I hope that in Denver things can be different
Every night at 7:30 p.m. See you there!
Yes we'd like to go tonight if people will be there again.
Yes, we'll be there! Let's keep it going....
The youth of Denver are leading the rally this afternoon at 4pm, Civic Center Park. Bring your families.

Thank you for organizing! I will try to join and will keep an eye out for future demonstrations in the neighborhood if I can‚Äôt get there tonight
Thank you so much for this!! It's great that parents are providing a safe place to show their support with their children. There have been many unsupervised children downtown causing mayhem during these and sadly this detrimental to the cause. I encourage parents to please be aware of where your children are during these protests. I was working in aid stations all weekend and there were plenty of teenagers trying to seek refuge after damaging police cars or starting fires. These acts only reflect poorly on the organizers that are trying to demonstrate peacefully. Thank you!!
Great idea to teach kids a peaceful way to stand up for what is right.
Extend yourself further
Support Black businesses 
Thank you for sharing.  This is a great resource - easy to search with links to all the stores.
I was there tonight. It was great. The support  seen and felt was encouraging.
We were too. Our daughter got to safely protest her rights as a young black woman at the ripe age of 12. 
Just saw this. Is it happening tomorrow night too? I just saw a peaceful protest in Austin that turned bad but I hope that in Denver things can be different
Every night at 7:30 p.m. See you there!
Yes we'd like to go tonight if people will be there again.
Yes, we'll be there! Let's keep it going....
The youth of Denver are leading the rally this afternoon at 4pm, Civic Center Park. Bring your families.
Scott, are there any plans to show up at Montview Blvd and Colorado Blvd. again?  It was a good experience last night (Wednesday).  Bob and Barb Sample
Let's do it every night indefinitely!

Saw you guys and gave a supportive honk! Thanks for bringing your children into this movement so they can hopefully witness history.
We are joining tonight and will be there soon!
I love this! We saw you all tonight on our way home. I‚Äôve been looking for safe ways to engage my kids in protest as well. Look forward to seeing you all on Friday night if you‚Äôll be there?

892,1043,588,154297474,Tom Fesing,East Colfax,9 Jul,"Flag of the Day - Argentina üá¶üá∑. Today marks 204 years of Argentine independence, thus marking 200 years of the Declaration of Independence of the United Provinces of the Rio de La Plata. Referred to as the Independence of Argentina, it was declared on July 9, 1816 by the Congress of Tucum√°n. 

The Argentine independence movement began in 1806, when British attacks on Buenos Aires were repelled by local militia with little help from Spain. Also important were the ramifications of Napoleon I‚Äôs intervention in Spain, beginning in 1808. Napoleon‚Äôs overthrow of Ferdinand VII plunged Spain into a civil war between two rival governments‚Äîone set up by Napoleon and the other created by patriotic juntas in the name of the exiled king and aided by the British. Under ancient principles of Spanish law, the king‚Äôs dominions in America had the right to govern themselves until the restoration of a lawful king, and on May 25, 1810 (now celebrated as the day of the revolution), Buenos Aires established an autonomous viceroyalty in the name of Ferdinand, pending his restoration. However, when it became apparent that Ferdinand was virtually powerless following his restoration in 1814, an assembly of the members of the viceroyalty met at a home in San Miguel de Tucum√°n to discuss the situation. On July 9, 1816, they declared the country independent under the name of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata.

The flag of Argentina was created by Manuel Belgrano, in line with the creation of the Cockade of Argentina, and was first raised at the city of Rosario on February 27, 1812, during the Argentine War of Independence. The National Flag Memorial was later built on the site. The First Triumvirate did not approve the use of the flag, but the Asamblea del A√±o XIII allowed the use of the flag as a war flag. It was the Congress of Tucum√°n which finally designated it as the national flag, in 1816. A yellow Sun of May was added to the center in 1818.

There is controversy of the true color of the first flag, between scientist and the descendants of Manuel Belgrano between blue and pale blue.

The sun image on the flag is called the Sun of May because it is a replica of an engraving on the first Argentine coin, approved in 1813, whose value was eight escudos(one Spanish dollar). It has 16 straight and 16 waved sunbeams.

I grew hops a few years ago.  Think they were ‚ÄúGolden hops‚Äù. They took over the ground and fence behind them.  And are ridiculously hard to get rid of.  Turns out they were not the right kind of hops for beer.  Who‚Äôknew?  So check this out and you will probably have to order by mail from a specialty grower.   Good luck!  Love you on 9‚ù£Ô∏è
Thanks, Rosemary L.!
Steve if you like tomatoes try husky cherry tomatoes. They are bigger than regular tomatoes and grow really good in a large pot. They grow so good I've had to pick daily they are so sweet & juicy. If you can't eat all at once rinse off dry and put in a Ziploc bag and freeze. You can use for salsa stew spaghetti sauce etc....
Ive stuck a basil plant or jalapeno in the dirt I try and use all the space I have...good luck and enjoy...üêûüêúüòÄüêùüêù
Basil grows great in pots!  I can eat caprese salad all summer long, but only with heirloom tomatoes.  If anyone is selling any later in the season, I am in!!!
Those plants look great, Steve, good picks!!
Try a trellis pot the link is to wayfair they have some nice ones. 
I bring basil in , over winter, replant in garden for 2nd summer. Trim and eat before it flowers & goes to seed. 
Steve, I am not sure if they are still doing it but AC Golden Brewing (part of MolsonCoors) gives rhizomes away for residents to grow and return the hops to be used in the Colorado Native brews. I believe it's to late this year to request one but maybe for next year if you are interested.
Make sure whatevee vessel you plant them in has adequate draining. I made this mistake with some indoor veggies I tried to grow and they never progressed beyond seedlings.
I have made almost 2000 masks now!

I grew hops a few years ago.  Think they were ‚ÄúGolden hops‚Äù. They took over the ground and fence behind them.  And are ridiculously hard to get rid of.  Turns out they were not the right kind of hops for beer.  Who‚Äôknew?  So check this out and you will probably have to order by mail from a specialty grower.   Good luck!  Love you on 9‚ù£Ô∏è
Thanks, Rosemary L.!
Steve if you like tomatoes try husky cherry tomatoes. They are bigger than regular tomatoes and grow really good in a large pot. They grow so good I've had to pick daily they are so sweet & juicy. If you can't eat all at once rinse off dry and put in a Ziploc bag and freeze. You can use for salsa stew spaghetti sauce etc....
Ive stuck a basil plant or jalapeno in the dirt I try and use all the space I have...good luck and enjoy...üêûüêúüòÄüêùüêù
Basil grows great in pots!  I can eat caprese salad all summer long, but only with heirloom tomatoes.  If anyone is selling any later in the season, I am in!!!
Those plants look great, Steve, good picks!!
Try a trellis pot the link is to wayfair they have some nice ones. 
I bring basil in , over winter, replant in garden for 2nd summer. Trim and eat before it flowers & goes to seed. 
Steve, I am not sure if they are still doing it but AC Golden Brewing (part of MolsonCoors) gives rhizomes away for residents to grow and return the hops to be used in the Colorado Native brews. I believe it's to late this year to request one but maybe for next year if you are interested.
Make sure whatevee vessel you plant them in has adequate draining. I made this mistake with some indoor veggies I tried to grow and they never progressed beyond seedlings.
I have made almost 2000 masks now!

We have an immediate need for housing, and Denver has made it a priority to address that need by working to make more options available for everybody. For the last two years, Denver city planners have been working with residents, policy experts, advocates and service providers, neighborhood groups and other community members to update the Denver Zoning Code‚Äôs regulations on residential uses.

The project's goal is to update zoning rules in support of the city‚Äôs strategy for more and better housing opportunities for all residents, to remove barriers for those who need supportive services and to provide greater clarity for providers and neighbors.

Starting next week, we'll host four open houses that will give residents an overview of the changes and an opportunity to share their thoughts. 

Visit www.DenverGov.org/groupliving for information on the project and the open houses, to get answers to key questions, to sign up for updates and details on future opportunities to participate.

Thanks for sharing! I found this article extremely informative. I don't see a problem with allowing more unrelated people to live together. Better than living on the streets. Y'all must really hate poor people if you're opposed to this.
No one has said they hate poor people.  Let's please discuss this issue without being snarky.
It's a good idea, within reason. 
I agree the idea should not be shut down, just better defined so it is not used by others out of the context and applied in a free range fashion.(edited)
They don't enforce these laws now!   The only thing this  will do is promote more people living in single family residences and allowing even more cars to a house. There is a house not far from me that I literally counted 11 vehicles parked in front of it.  On what used to be the lawn etc...   This is ridiculous and the powers that are suggesting this is a good idea are also ridiculous...  It is not an either or scenario for those who say better than people living on the streets.  Most of those people are not on teh streets because of these rules!
I believe allowing people to solve their own problems with them cooperating is the best option and interfering with it should not be done.
I agree for the most part, except mental illness, addiction (self medicating), handicaps, domestic abuse (not always just physical) have to be accounted for. Sone people are not capable mentally to get it together others need that little boost or resources. Some need to feel someone cares for motivation. Some are plain embarrassed. People need people. But also people need to take responsibility. Compassion and common sense are two great abilities. The world is not and will never be black and white. Embrace & learn to love the complexity of the gray area inbetween. Not pointing fingers at you just making a statement.
Preliminary information from a community HOA meeting is that the recommendation will be up to 8 unrelated people per 1600 square foot property and for each additional 200 square feet 1 unrelated person is allowed.  Seems like a lot of cars...and potential people - each one can have related people in the home too?  So a 2000 square foot home can have up to 10 unrelated people.  Not saying that this shouldn't be looked at just make it reasonable and then enforce it.(edited)
Lots of open space in Kansas.(edited)
Im from there.... runaway! Runaway!
Wrong answer to the problem. There‚Äôs room at your mom‚Äôs house.‚Äôlive with her.(edited)
Which city council members and donors will be making big money off of this? Rent a house for $2000 to 1 family or to 10 people for $1000 each. The house next to me is already falling apart as a rental.... I'm sure the landlord would take full advantage of this.
I have reviewed the information for this proposal and can find nothing in it to benefit the citizens of Denver. Aside from the obvious parking issues which could potentially be 16 more vehicles parked on the streets. All this does is allow non Denver residents that own property in Denver to get more in rent and create ghettos. Please contact your Councilperson and let them know you oppose this ordinance change.
This goes WAY beyond parking.

Here's another article that I thought was pretty informative. https://denverite.com/2020/02/06/do-you-know-denvers-rules-about-living-together-heres-what-some-people-want-to-change-about-them/
i have been following this issue closely for months; restrictions on unrelated cohabitants are just one aspect out of several to the group living amendment; before jumping to conclusions, i suggest reading through the page linked in the OP ‚Äî it will help you understand the reasoning and be more realistic about the impacts
‚ÄúWe are modernizing a very outdated code with an eye toward equity,‚Äù said Andrew Webb, the city planner who has managed the project on zoning for group living. ‚ÄúWe certainly think it‚Äôs very important to bring the code up to speed with the way people living together has evolved.‚Äù
That‚Äôs my concern. How it reads right now is one thing. How it works, is monitored and controlled in a wide spectrum of potential applications  is  my concern. None of this is addressed.
Or leave troubled neighbors with no way to resolve violations.
Why more housing we got enough people here. Why not invest your little project into something more useful like trying to save our planet or like preserve land and sanctuaries. Climate change does exist people. Our environment is on the bridge of dying.
You're comparing apples to oranges!  Of course the environment matters, but if you think affordable housing is not important, take a look outside your window today and try to imagine that it's you that has to sleep outside in this storm!
If it's similar to Section 8 Housing rules & regs, what will the maximum number of occupant limits be in one residence?  Who will be responsible for overseeing the maximum number doesn't end up being more that number + 2, 3, 4, 5, or more?  We know of two Section 8 housing locations where the occupants are supposed to be a woman and her children. Grandma, great grandmoms, boyfriend and a host of others bunk under the same roof.  New s never watered (replaced a multitude of times), window coverings trashed, broken windows, dog excrement all over, and the insides look squalid.  Just saying.  A residence like this could be your next door neighbor.
So true. There are homes rented to groups of students around DU and they are always a mess.
Steve H Please read what definition of Gerrymandering is. Hint it is a political term Not a zoning term. I believe in capitalism and made $ building moderate and low income housing in Denver for 20 years. The current free market in real estate and higher end houseing market left to its own has contributed to many but not all of the problems. The United States has not had a completely free market in over 150 years. Read the history of the Erie Canal which could never have been built without government subsidies. That Canal provide a major boost in the economy during that period while the country was in a recession with grain and other agricultural products flowing to Eastern cities and industrial products going west. Many of the railroads the same and in particular the East West Continental Railroads were highly lsubsidized. I completely agree that these efforts are a drop in the proverbial bucket for very low income and homeless which is a far more complex problem that housing. Where would young teachers, restaurant and grocery workers, other service and factory and warehouse workers live in the future. Answer will be building further East, North into prime farmland for example Weld County. Weld  is the largest producer and of Agricultural products in Colorado and more than any in the West until the large Agricultural Valleys in Southern California. South also to Colorado Springs. This is highly iinefficiencty spreading out chewing up more land and resources. Maybe you have your little slice of heaven. I do but I am 71 and I care about my kids and grandchildren in Denver where my daughter who has a College degree and her husband a Community College Business degree. They struggle living in a two bedroom apartment with kids. They will move in with me and I will move into my basement until I build my garage and 700 square ft living space. I care about how my grandchildren and there working class peers are educated etc. I have a law degree and a. Master's degree. Athletic ability paid for most of my education and growing up in two schools systems one ranked #2 in New York State and the other somewhere in the top 8 in Illinois.
Ken Strohson i think you meant to address Samuel Hargraves; but yeah, a lot of ranting here
I‚Äôm assuming this new revised plan will not be implemented in single family neighborhoods but pushed into the new gentrified neighborhoods where a large part of the homes were bought to flip rather than live in and now these landlords are more than willing to let as many strangers they can get into their houses to make a profit. If these houses are not YOUR neighbors than it sounds like a great idea. I‚Äôm speaking as a home owner who has already went through this... It will never end well!
Um Kristi, this new revised plan is aimed EXACTLY at single family neighborhoods and their zoning. Next time you vote, find out who hearts this and don't vote for them.  That might include your present rep.....we'll see. So your assumption is wrong.

I just wanted to remind everyone to please tip your Instacart (all delivery) workers well :)

We deliver groceries to the Park Hill neighborhood (and beyond) during these times and many people don‚Äôt tip or tip a very small amount. Myself and many others work for Instacart and maybe it isn‚Äôt known but Instacart pays about $8 per grocery delivery (no hourly pay) a very small living wage so that being said we work for tips ! 

I just wanted to put this out there for people like myself who have lost their job and now purely rely on delivery services as an income. 

Let‚Äôs all care for one another and everyone who is helping us during these times.

Stay safe and take care :)",good person happy want remind tip delivery worker deliver grocery neighborhood time people tip tip small work maybe know pay grocery delivery hourly pay small living wage say work tip want people lose job purely rely delivery service income let care help time go come stay safe care,"Thank you for all that you do !!

I'm very limited on money and a small amount is all I can give sorry you don't feel it's enough
No need for negativity we are all in this together :)
Thank you for mentioning this! Is it the same for prime grocery delivery? We are able to add a tip before we order over Amazon, would this be in addition to that?
Thanks and take care ! :)
I saw this on the news last winter and thought that it was so good, I stole the idea.  Our delivery drivers are keeping us safe.  Tip them really well and do something special if you are like us and have EVERYTHING delivered right now. Thanks to all frontline workers!
Love this !! Thank you so much :)
You all deserve nice tips!!
Thank you for mentioning this Mimi. I am relying on Instacart also for my only income and I'm grateful for the work and tips. People do need to know it's hard work, and there are expenses for us too (vehicle expenses, gas, maintenance). Consider the following when tipping also.. are you in an apartment building where there is limited parking and we will have to bring your groceries up an elevator and down a long hallway? That's more time and physically can be challenging. I just hope people recognize that or offer to meet at the door to assist if your not going to tip or don't have it to tip. It really is a premium service to have people grocery shop for you and deliver it. If the industry standard for serving in restaurants is 20% shouldn't shopping and delivery services be in that ballpark? Instacart default on the tip used to be 5%. I don't know if it's changed. I think it's a good thing to tip according to the service also. If your shopper provides better level of service or on the flip side is rude unresponsive takes too long delivering take those factors into consideration also. 
... days easier! I prematurely posted before I was done with my thought üí≠ stay safe and healthy everyone.
Shannon Haines 
It's a huge privilege to stay home and utilize these services. Your shopper is taking the risk so that you don't have to. It's sad to think there are people who don't tip at all!
I do tip Instacart drivers.  But what about when you open your bags and items are missing?  I know they find those items in their car. Why not bring us our items. Happened several times to me.
Once the delivery is completed they can no longer contact you or see your address.
This is helpful information as I don‚Äôt ever used this service but would not know to tip and now I do if I ever start using it. Thank you!(edited)
Happy to tip accordingly, when all my groceries are present and in acceptable condition.  I have received soggy grocery bags full of wet food because a bottle or eggs broke.
That is not acceptable. You pay for usable groceries. When something like this happens, and unfortunately it does.. sometimes we drop things or inadvertently something gets crushed. If I know about it, I will let the customer know and suggest they contact Instacart to request a refund of any damaged items. Hopefully that‚Äôs what u did. If they dropped the stuff at the door damaged and didn‚Äôt tell you about it- because how would u not know about a wet bag of eggs :) maybe mention that. It‚Äôs good feedback for us also to know about your experience too! Thanks.
Thanks for posting. I'm having everything delivered right now. I had groceries delivered from Walmart the other day by a young woman that worked for Door Dash. I felt bad because I had a couple heavy items delivered. I wish I would have noticed she was bringing stuff to the door right away, I have a wagon that folds up that I use to carry stuff from my vehicle to the house back when I could shop. I would have let her use it to. When I mentioned it she said she would like to get one herself. She told me about the small amount she gets paid by Door Dash and how a lot of people don't tip. She said she did an order the day before mine and had to carry 4-24 packs of soda up to the 3rd floor of a building and she didn't get any tip on that order. 
I'm glad you brought up this topic. I've never been sure what to do when my groceries are delivered. I went ahead and tipped, anyway, wondering if I'd already ""tipped"" the person by way of charges tacked on to my order. I'm so appreciative of anyone who helps me out, especially since I'm stuck at home with this quarantine! I've always been a good tipper, but now, realizing how little you're paid, I'll pay extra attention to what I give to my shopper/delivery person.
I am so sorry Mimi.  This is terrible. These folks are driving to/from the grocery store, shopping for you in a pandemic & delivering the food to your front door after possibly carrying your groceries down the street & up flights of stairs and people don‚Äôt tip??? 
Well said. Perhaps a softer approach to convey the message, üòã but I‚Äôm learning and liking how direct people seem to be in Colorado. You are right tho.
You can only give what you have I'm 2 miles from store and give 3dollars which I can't afford but I give and not to Wal-Mart I give to driver.
I always tip well, hopefully you ªll get one of mine!
It's really sad that the delivery companies are so cheap and treating their employees like crap. Yes it's imperative to tip, but a good business should be paying their employees a sustainable wage, even if they are part-time or contract workers. These delivery companies are making a fortune right now and it's disgusting that they're paying the employees so poorly. I always over tip and those who can afford to do so, should.  But also please keep in mind that some people don't have other options and they are also perhaps in a compromise position and/or strapped for cash because of covid;  perhaps they are out of work,b lost their car or jobs or are in poor health, etc.
Instacart calculates a delivery charge plus tips and another charge equal to tip charge! I find that that is all I can afford most times! I have started picking up my groceries after ordering online and I believe in tipping but find myself without cash for a tip! I will try to add some extra to the tip when I use Instacart!
Mimi Kyles, start your own business on the side! We will support you!

What does it look like to ""end poverty"" when the homeless population in Denver is ever-increasing?
As long as there are guns there will be gun violence.
And as long as there are people, there will be violence.(edited)
I work with Denver Area Youth Services and I go into the detention center and I do court ordered substance-abuse evaluation‚Äôs with kids. 80% of them have gun charges. Not all of them come from poverty and not all of them are doing drugs. One thing is for sure it is really easy for these kids to get guns.It is almost always about power, being powerful or intimidating others.
Sure, if they are in an environment where power is the currency since money isn't stable or available. If you work with these kids then you should know that poverty is a breeding ground for all kinds of crime and violence and unplanned pregnancies and many other consequences of people living in desperation. There isn't much gun or gang violence in Silicon Valley.
I feel that if more parents spent time with their children, and parent their kids then most kids would not be committing the crimes, or be the victim of the crime. Why, because they'd be at home with their family rather than running the streets. Most parents don't know where their kids are at 90% of the time, they don't know the kid's name or anything about the parents or the environment in which they are going. Sometimes society needs to step back and do things the old  school way. My mother would never let us out the door without telling her where we were going, what time we'd be home before 10 pm, and then who are the parents. Later, mom would go over and introduce herself to the other parents if she saw a friend ship developing. Parents need to get more involved in their kids rather than the cell phone. Yeah, I said this! You go into stores or places and the kids yelling to the mother and she's so busy on the phone she can't stop to pay attention to the child. Yeah, I;m calling you out!!!!!(edited)
Perhaps if the cost if living in this city want so outrageous parents wouldn't have to work two or three jobs for the child to have a home and could be there to be a family. It's a bigger problem than just poor parenting.
This seems like the VERY LEAST the mayor could do. Took him long enough.
I think that a mentor ship would be a good idea of showing more positive ways of life, from men who could be an example of positive influence
A one hour conference call is performative and non productive.   The mayor needs to have a 3 hour in person community meeting as a start.  This event is merely a way for the mayor to check a box.
That was my first feeling. Meet people. Form a committee tasked with researching solutions. Meet people again. Implement solutions with the most potential from both long-term and short-term perspectives.
A call is a step forward to hear concerns and ideas to move forward. Always a complaint, sometimes baby steps r a beginning there have been programs in the past and people who have reached out to gang members and tried other solutions, parents need to play a part with their teens as well as a prevention as far as their anger, etc.
We are way passed baby steps.
Exactly
Why is in person better than expressing on a conference,call in person will cost the city money for security etc.
I mean, if Mayor Hancock can show up to Cyclebar Denver‚Äôs Union Station grand opening, I feel like he could meet in person with the community when young people are dying. Esp when his development projects and the gentrification of Denver are adding to the problem.
Because he would need to look people, grieving parents, in the eye.  He's from there!
Y
I believe he probably has already done that in a more personal way, he is not at fault and cannot prevent it from happening redevelopment and gentrification has nothing to do with youth violence, this has been going on long before redevelopment and gentrification, youth could care less about those too things, why would youth be killing each other because of adult issues.
If you follow activists from the impacted communities,  you know that they are not impressed with this feeble attempt.  Nor are they impressed with the mayor's facilitation of said gentrification.
That's great and all, but he needs to get out here IN PERSON to address the violence that is killing our kids.
We are listening, Ambria, and committed to making an impact. Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
How does the Mayor facilitate, gentrification? He lives close to the area where much of the violence has gone on, I haven‚Äôt seen response from any activist in Aurora or Montebello, if they even have any. Where did u see an activist speak on the matter everyone is saddened by the violence, but there r matters that need to be done, it is not one simple solution. What do u mean Diane, he is from there? From where? Most of u have never ever dealt with these sort of issues so don‚Äôt be so fast to judge as to what needs to be done and how. Years ago I had a friend her son was killed in front of their house, never found out who killed him, if it could be solved so easily don‚Äôt u think it would be solved by now so it would not be anymore teen deaths. I feel empathy and much sadness, for those that has lost their child I can‚Äôt imagine having to loose my child, in fact the mayor has teenagers too. People on ND seem to have complaints but no solutions for too much but fault and pointing the finger in the opposite direction, other than looking at self to find or suggestions for the problem.
Then Diane what r ur big girl solutions, since u r so negative, I bet u have no idea where to begin meeting the grieving is not a solution to the problem. There is no comfort in loosing ur child unnecessarily. U figure it out u have so many ideas, express them in whatever way u want to make a difference. U and Ambria ought to brainstorm some solutions.
Diane u and Ambria Reed should submit ur ideas for an end on conference call or whatever way u feel productive and useful.
Kathy, do you work for the mayor or something? Baby steps for children being killed? Mike Coffman has already had several meetings in Aurora, and Hancock can only do one phone conference. So he doesn't have to answer to people and control the narrative? C'mon.
Jay Miller Yup. I mean, if Coffman can do it, why can't Hancock?
Is the call-in number really the '302' Area Code versus '303'?
I was wondering the same. Not that I‚Äôm going to call in‚Ä¶ I already see this for what it really is. Just seemed a bit odd they‚Äôd post a Delaware phone number

I work with Denver Area Youth Services and I go into the detention center and I do court ordered substance-abuse evaluation‚Äôs with kids. 80% of them have gun charges. Not all of them come from poverty and not all of them are doing drugs. One thing is for sure it is really easy for these kids to get guns.It is almost always about power, being powerful or intimidating others.
Sure, if they are in an environment where power is the currency since money isn't stable or available. If you work with these kids then you should know that poverty is a breeding ground for all kinds of crime and violence and unplanned pregnancies and many other consequences of people living in desperation. There isn't much gun or gang violence in Silicon Valley.
I feel that if more parents spent time with their children, and parent their kids then most kids would not be committing the crimes, or be the victim of the crime. Why, because they'd be at home with their family rather than running the streets. Most parents don't know where their kids are at 90% of the time, they don't know the kid's name or anything about the parents or the environment in which they are going. Sometimes society needs to step back and do things the old  school way. My mother would never let us out the door without telling her where we were going, what time we'd be home before 10 pm, and then who are the parents. Later, mom would go over and introduce herself to the other parents if she saw a friend ship developing. Parents need to get more involved in their kids rather than the cell phone. Yeah, I said this! You go into stores or places and the kids yelling to the mother and she's so busy on the phone she can't stop to pay attention to the child. Yeah, I;m calling you out!!!!!(edited)
Perhaps if the cost if living in this city want so outrageous parents wouldn't have to work two or three jobs for the child to have a home and could be there to be a family. It's a bigger problem than just poor parenting.
This seems like the VERY LEAST the mayor could do. Took him long enough.
I think that a mentor ship would be a good idea of showing more positive ways of life, from men who could be an example of positive influence
A one hour conference call is performative and non productive.   The mayor needs to have a 3 hour in person community meeting as a start.  This event is merely a way for the mayor to check a box.
That was my first feeling. Meet people. Form a committee tasked with researching solutions. Meet people again. Implement solutions with the most potential from both long-term and short-term perspectives.
A call is a step forward to hear concerns and ideas to move forward. Always a complaint, sometimes baby steps r a beginning there have been programs in the past and people who have reached out to gang members and tried other solutions, parents need to play a part with their teens as well as a prevention as far as their anger, etc.
We are way passed baby steps.
Exactly
Why is in person better than expressing on a conference,call in person will cost the city money for security etc.
I mean, if Mayor Hancock can show up to Cyclebar Denver‚Äôs Union Station grand opening, I feel like he could meet in person with the community when young people are dying. Esp when his development projects and the gentrification of Denver are adding to the problem.
Because he would need to look people, grieving parents, in the eye.  He's from there!
Y
I believe he probably has already done that in a more personal way, he is not at fault and cannot prevent it from happening redevelopment and gentrification has nothing to do with youth violence, this has been going on long before redevelopment and gentrification, youth could care less about those too things, why would youth be killing each other because of adult issues.
If you follow activists from the impacted communities,  you know that they are not impressed with this feeble attempt.  Nor are they impressed with the mayor's facilitation of said gentrification.
That's great and all, but he needs to get out here IN PERSON to address the violence that is killing our kids.
We are listening, Ambria, and committed to making an impact. Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
How does the Mayor facilitate, gentrification? He lives close to the area where much of the violence has gone on, I haven‚Äôt seen response from any activist in Aurora or Montebello, if they even have any. Where did u see an activist speak on the matter everyone is saddened by the violence, but there r matters that need to be done, it is not one simple solution. What do u mean Diane, he is from there? From where? Most of u have never ever dealt with these sort of issues so don‚Äôt be so fast to judge as to what needs to be done and how. Years ago I had a friend her son was killed in front of their house, never found out who killed him, if it could be solved so easily don‚Äôt u think it would be solved by now so it would not be anymore teen deaths. I feel empathy and much sadness, for those that has lost their child I can‚Äôt imagine having to loose my child, in fact the mayor has teenagers too. People on ND seem to have complaints but no solutions for too much but fault and pointing the finger in the opposite direction, other than looking at self to find or suggestions for the problem.
Then Diane what r ur big girl solutions, since u r so negative, I bet u have no idea where to begin meeting the grieving is not a solution to the problem. There is no comfort in loosing ur child unnecessarily. U figure it out u have so many ideas, express them in whatever way u want to make a difference. U and Ambria ought to brainstorm some solutions.
Diane u and Ambria Reed should submit ur ideas for an end on conference call or whatever way u feel productive and useful.
Kathy, do you work for the mayor or something? Baby steps for children being killed? Mike Coffman has already had several meetings in Aurora, and Hancock can only do one phone conference. So he doesn't have to answer to people and control the narrative? C'mon.
Jay Miller Yup. I mean, if Coffman can do it, why can't Hancock?
Is the call-in number really the '302' Area Code versus '303'?
I was wondering the same. Not that I‚Äôm going to call in‚Ä¶ I already see this for what it really is. Just seemed a bit odd they‚Äôd post a Delaware phone number
Another child dead in Montbello today.

Florence, you are a real treasure of information for our neighborhood.
This is excellent news! Now if we could add a few hotels near the hospital for frontliners in healthcare that have had potential or definite exposure so their families aren't exposed as well that'd be just great.
That's an excellent idea.  So many healthcare providers would feel so much relief if they had that option to protect their families. It's so stressful to try to isolate at home especially with children.
In Sacramento, the state of California has attempted to commandeer the Hyatt hotel. That is a hotel which my son-in-law is a director. He employs 300 people at that hotel. The owners of the hotel did not want it to be used for homeless housing as they had just finished a multi million dollar renovation and knew that the hotel would be returned to them wrecked. So the owners at the hotel elected to close the property and dismiss all of those employees including my son-in-law who has worked in management with HIIT for 10 years.

I've seen some people react very negatively  when an innocent employee who is covering the front door to an establishment stops them about masks.  It's a tough situation.  An employee shouldn't have to be at risk by enforcing the wearing of masks!  I was at HD recently (wearing a mask) and I feel like I saw a box of masks by customer service (I could be wrong) and maybe they should at the very least have the box by the front door and 'offer' a mask to anyone who enters if they don't have one.  this might help a bit but again, if someone is refusing, it's certainly not the responsibility of any of the employees to put themselves at risk to enforce this.  I really feel for these retail establishments and dealing with people who just refuse to think about others.
I‚Äôve seen ACE have someone stand at the door and turn customers away if they didn‚Äôt have a mask on.
The refusal to wear a mask makes no sense to me. But yes, I have been going to Ace on the Fax which is incredible and I feel so safe going there.  Plus Ace on the Fax is a franchise owned by a local woman whereas HD is a corporation so I'd rather my money go to Ace.
Good to know this. I will definitely avoid HD because I don't want to go anywhere where there is threat of violence since I think that is a very selfish and ""primitive"" way of expressing oneself. I'd rather support a woman-owned business anyway and avoid as much obnoxious behavior as I can.
I too have been avoiding HD and giving all my business to ACE because of their policies. Please error on the side of caution.
No shoes, no shirt, no service! No mask, no service! It's a public health issue.
I've heard that some men refuse to wear a mask because they think it makes them look ""weak"". So only having concern for their own vanity and no concern for the well-being of others is supposed to make them look ""strong""? To me it just makes them look ignorant, pigheaded and selfish, not being qualities that I associate with strength.
hmm I wonder where they got those ideas from...‚Äùour‚Äù dear leaderü§®
The True Value on Colfax is also locally owned and customers there seem very mask compliant.
The customers yes, the staff...not so much.
Disappointing about HD... a few weeks ago they were good about enforcing masks, and turning away customers who weren't wearing them. I guess that's changed now. Will be shopping at True Value then.
Dorota, enforcing is one thing, doing battle with some a-hole who gets violent about it is another whole can of worms. I don't blame anybody for not wanting to get into fisticuffs with someone too selfish and primitive to want to put on a mask.
Kelly Taylor or shot
It‚Äôs the same at Lowe‚Äôs and Walmart. When I asked employees about it I was told management instructed them not to enforce the mask law.
There's a big difference between a store policy to require/ask for masks on customers and one that doesn't bother. I can well understand not wanting to do battle with someone who turns savage about a small request like ""please wear a mask in the store"" but to places that don't even bother trying to get customers to comply, I'd rather avoid them because the more people who wear masks the safer we all will be. Personally, for someone who's been following the stay-at-home orders since mid-March hoping to avoid a re-spiking in illness in Denver, I would prefer keeping myself safe and others as well, since their health impacts mine and the entire community. Being locked in at home is getting a little old. . .
Never shop at Home Depot, anyway; would rather go to True Value on Colfax.
I‚Äôve avoided HD for years. Ace on the Fax hires very helpful employees and, oh - they‚Äôre trying to keep us safe. No brainer for me.
Retailers will require masks and distancing when 100% of their customers are mask-less and are boycotted by the 75% of cautious customers.
I witnessed 2 customers verbally assaulting the poor gentleman at the door who was enforcing the mask rule and threatening to ""kick his ass"" when I went shortly after it first reopened.  Something similar happened again the last time I was there.
They could and should call the police!
Completely agree with you Betty Miller!  It's a very slippery slope for employees who are really at risk trying to enforce this.
Personally, I wish the governor would make mask-wearing manditory, but then those who only think to frame it as a ""freedom"" issue would go ballistic and likely become more belligerent than they are already. 
I think in Denver they are mandatory.
Thank you all for weighing in.  I think the boycott idea is most appropriate.  Patronize those places that respect ALL people‚Äôs safety.
I do t think it‚Äôs fair to blame HD. I still go there - I just give the jerks a wide berth.
Last time I was at hd on Quebec it was basically impossible to give anyone a wide berth, especially the people who believe the whole thing is made up and are not concerned with giving space
If smaller ACE and True Value can provide staff to comply with our regs, why can't big box HD.  I concur with Andrew S.
This is obviously anecdotal, but it seems that more conscientious, less pig-headed and aggressive people are shopping at the smaller stores.  So, maybe it's an easier task. 
City of Denver has advised businesses to call 311 to report customers who  refuse to wear masks and not to serve them. No shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service.
While refusing to serve the mask-less seems like a good solution, I wouldn't want to be the cashier who refuses service to someone who's going to go ape-sh!t over being asked to wear a mask in the first place. I can imagine that person throwing hammers or whatever they are trying to buy because they can't get service because they won't wear a mask. That will prove how ""strong"" they are. I also don't expect they will wait around for 311 to send someone to deal with them, either.
The Glendale  HD was good last week.
311 should be called when they enter the store per City of Denver guidelines. Of course no one should try to physically stop a maskless customer. Nothing in any store is worth risking injury or worse.
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-on-covid-19-and-masks
Customers can call 311 as well.  A while ago, the Bass Pro Shop at Northfield had about 50% compliance.  They said an inspector would visit the store.
People here in Denver have been shot over a mask argument. I like Ace on the fax, and Lowe's in Aurora. They do a good job of spreading people out and both have a giant hand sanitizer when you first walk in To sanitize upon entering and leaving. Sometimes I have to go to home depot I just wear my mask avoid people get my stuff and go. They are trying but they missed the timeframe as far as requiring masks at the door to enter. Since they made it this far it would be hell to change now.
Think they could change but it‚Äôs too expensive to do so.  Perhaps stock holders will raise the issue if business goes down
Some people will never wear masks. They don't understand the reasons for doing it and don't accept the science. They think they know better so they will do whatever they want, no matter what.
